They sat around the same metal table in the same rust orange vinyl chairs. They drank their black coffee, smoked their cigarettes, and aired their grievances. \n\t\u201cI reckon they oughta lock up a crazy like that and throw away the key. What\u2019re they doin\u2019 with him? \u201d Buddy asked.\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s at the hospital. They called in some lady doctor from the crazy house in Big Spring.

She walked by the group and smiled and placed her items on the counter. \n\t\u201cY\u2019all\u2019re worse than a sewing circle,\u201d said the clerk as he rang up Dr. Brooks. \n\tEarl blushed and pulled the rim of his baseball cap down. Buddy looked down at the table, and Joe Don gave her a wink. Dr. Brooks paid and gathered her items. She waved and said, \u201cYou fellas have a great day.\u201d\n\tDr. Brooks hopped in her black luxury SUV and drove down Main Street to the county hospital. She received curious stares as she sped through the small West Texas town of fifteen hundred. There was not a single stoplight in town and only a handful of businesses. She used the term \u201chospital\u201d loosely to describe the twenty bed medical facility. Only one patient sat in the emergency room waiting room. The slow pace was unsettling to Dr. Brooks.\n\tShe arrived at room 107 and spied through the barely cracked door. A motherly nurse calmly reassured the disoriented patient. She squeezed his hand. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, dear. The doctor will be here any minute, and then we\u2019re gonna get you home.\u201d\n\tThe terrified stranger\u2019s eyes darted around the room. He caught a glimpse of the doctor\u2019s jade green eyes peering through the crack, and he shuddered at her glance. Dr. Brooks furrowed her brow upon finding the patient conscious. She realized her involuntary expression and plastered on a fake toothy smile. She lightly knocked before entering the room. \n\t\u201cGood morning. I\u2019m Dr. Brooks,\u201d she said as she held out her hand. The patient glared at the doctor, refusing to extend his hand in return. She pulled back from the rejected handshake and fiddled with her long ponytail.\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s been pretty agitated since he came to,\u201d the nurse said.\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s certainly understandable,\u201d said Dr. Brooks. \u201cI know you must have other patients to attend to.\u201d \n\tThe nurse didn\u2019t really have any other patients, but she could take a hint. The man grabbed her hand tighter. His stunned expression seemed to beg her to stay. \u201cThe doctor\u2019s gonna take good care of you.\u201d She patted his shoulder and left the room.\n\tDr. Brook\u2019s smile morphed into a menacing smirk. The man tightly pulled the sheet up to his neck and cowered in fear. He struggled to speak. He worked his mouth and was finally able to utter, \u201cI kn-kn-know who y-y-you are. Y-y-you were on the sh-ship.\u201d\n\tFlashes of the night before came back to him. He remembered the bright lights almost blinding him. He was able to make out two almost reptilian creatures and two forms that seemed human. Although he fought to move, he was being held down. Not by physical restraints but rather by an energy, He screeched in pain as the beings conducted painful medical experiments. He faded in and out of consciousness. He couldn\u2019t remember his name or where he was from. However, he did remember those piercing green eyes.\n\tDr. Brooks cackled. \u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s your word against mine.

It\u2019s perfect, really. We\u2019ve been infiltrating the small towns for years. Soon, it will be the bigger cities. We can do our research and conduct our experiments without notice.\u201d She moved closer to him and poked him in the chest with her long pointed finger. \u201cAll because no one believes nutjobs like you.\u201d\n\tThe man tried to move, but he felt the pressure of the same energy that restrained him in the spacecraft. She tilted her head, lifted the syringe, and stabbed him in the chest. His muscles contracted, and he let out a piercing scream. His body then went limp. She shoved the syringe in her pocket and threw herself on the floor and backed into the corner. She let out a fake cry for help. \n\tThe old timers gathered the next morning at the Country Mart to drink their black coffee and compare notes about the excitement the previous day.\n\t\u201cFaye was on duty when it happened.

It is a long dark green strip of pine trees surrounded by the cold Atlantic waves. You haven\u2019t been to Swan\u2019s Island in more than two decades. As a child, you made the long trip to the island every summer. Your Uncle Bill, the kindest man you\u2019ve ever known, had a small home on the island. He passed away when you were in college, and you haven\u2019t been back since.\n        During those childhood summers, the island had been a quiet respite from your urban life in New York City. You swam in the brisk Maine waters and learned to kayak. Uncle Bill, like most of his neighbors, was a cheerful old lobsterman who had lived on the island for his whole life. Your mother had also grown up on the island, and she had very little interest in going back. She always drove you from the city up to the small Maine town and helped you board the ferry, but then left you to have some time on your own with your uncle. \n        Uncle Bill had been patient with you and taught you the basics of his trade. You\u2019d wake up with him at the first light of dawn. You\u2019d jump on his boat and pull on the heavy oil pants. He showed you how to maintain the lobster traps and untangle seaweed from the plastic coated heavy wire. \n        You feel the warm surge of nostalgia overcome you as you step off the ferry and see the familiar general store. It is the only functional store on the island. You used to know the owners, so you want to stop in to say hello. However, when you get to the building, you see that it is shuttered. There is a sign in the window reading: \u201cThank you for all the years, Swan\u2019s Island. We love you.\u201d\n        You\u2019re renting a house that is walking distance from the ferry dock. You\u2019re surprised by how quiet the street is. During the summers, the population of the little island usually swells to over a thousand residents. However, in the fall and winter months, less than 300 people live on the island. Almost everyone who lives on Swan\u2019s year round is a lobsterman. There is very little else to do.\n        This quiet is exactly what you\u2019ve been craving. Recently, you finally ended a relationship with the woman you had once wanted to marry and your depression had been rearing its ugly head. Your professional life is also falling apart because you have an impossible goal to meet. \n        For the last five years, you\u2019ve worked your way up the ladder in a small tech company. You started as an intern when the company only had three other employees. Now, you are the head of HR for a company with more than a hundred remote workers. The CEO just landed a huge new contract, but left you with the mandate to double your staff in the next three months. You\u2019d been working around the clock to find new candidates but had been feeling frustrated and stuck. You\u2019d decided to escape all of it and take a week off to decompress. Your mom told you to visit her and your new stepdad in Florida, but you'd been dreaming about pine trees and knew where you needed to go.\n        As you\u2019re getting settled into the functional little rental house, you hear a knock on the door. A man in his late 60s is standing in your doorway. His face has the familiar weathered look of a fisherman. He introduces himself as your neighbor, Harold. You invite him in and he accepts. \n        A few minutes later, you are both sipping beers at the little table in the kitchen. Harold tells you a bit about his life on the island. Harold\u2019s harsh New England accent makes you smile; he reminds you of your Uncle Bill. \n        Three beers in, Harold really starts opening up. The lobster fishing has become a lot harder, he explains. There is not as much life in the waters as there used to be, and the cost of maintaining his boat is becoming astronomical. You mention that you were surprised that the general store was closed. He tells you that the couple who\u2019d run the store for more than thirty years had recently sold and moved back to the mainland. Harold grows somber as he tells you that most of the old timers have been leaving. Island life is beautiful, and the community means everything to him, but he feels that he is losing his grip on his future.\n        The only thing he owns is his land. It had never been worth much. There are tourists during the summer months, but none of the main-landers want to purchase a home in such a remote location. Some of the Swan\u2019s Islanders, whose families had fished these waters for generations, are moving back to the mainland and just abandoning their homes. Harold has been going around the island doing maintenance on some of the houses, hoping that his friends will come back. He isn\u2019t sure how much longer he can hold out. \n        You ask him how many long term residents have picked up and left Swan\u2019s Island. He looks at you sadly and says, \u201chundreds\u201d.\n        You think about Harold\u2019s story for the whole day as you wander around the rustic beauty of the island. \n        Later that week, you are frustrated with yourself. Your recruitment efforts have been moving at a snail\u2019s pace. Every morning, you wake early, go down to the little dock outside your house and kayak around the bay as you watch Harold and other local lobstermen throwing out their traps. When you return to your rental house, refreshed and alert with the sea air in your lungs, you think you will be ready to get back to work. But you cannot muster up the energy to open your computer, log back into the distant world of your tech startup, and review the resumes and applications that have accumulated. \n        While you are attempting to focus, you see Harold hauling lobsters from his boat. You go down to give him a hand. While working, you tell him about your dilemma. Finding people with the work ethic and the tech skills to fill all of your open positions was proving more challenging than you imagined. You are afraid that you will disappoint your leadership team and that you might even lose your job. Harold nods and asks, \u201cWhat kind of skills do these people you are hiring need?\u201d\n        You explain that you are hiring people with coding experience and start giving Harold more detail. \u201cYou don\u2019t know any coders, do you?\u201d you ask.\n        \u201cYou know\u2026 Come to think of it, I just might.\u201d Harold\u2019s answer surprises you. You ask him who he knows. He then goes on to tell a story about Kai, Swan\u2019s Island\u2019s only teacher. \n        Years ago there was a somewhat thriving school district on the island. In fact, there was both a small elementary school and a high school at one point. Harold had grown up on the island and attended the schools himself. But in recent years, the population had become too small and all the school age children had left for the mainland or were mostly self-educated. But then Kai came to town.\n\tKai was sent by the state of Maine and, as representative of the state, had a bit of a hard time making headway in the tiny island community. Everyone had expected that they would be like the other educators who came to the island for a year or two then disappeared and brought all of their ideas of progress and change with them. But Kai had stuck it out in the little Swan\u2019s Island school. They\u2019d been a remarkable teacher and had established a modern one room school. Kai encouraged families to keep their children on the island and had taught the local kids all the normal reading and math skills. However, their real passion was to teach about technology. Kai had petitioned the state of Maine to send computers to the tiny district and began teaching the kids all kinds of skills that Harold did not fully understand.\n        You ask more about this teacher. Where does Kai live? Can you meet them? Before you know it, you are walking back into town with Harold.\n        Kai is in the schoolroom, and when you walk in with Harold, you are impressed by how clean and organized everything is. Kai is a striking looking person with a short buzz cut, a pierced nose, and a bright purple pullover sweater. Kai looks more like they belong in your trendy startup office than in a one room school house on a fishing island.\n\tHarold introduces you and Kai smiles when you explain what you do and who you are looking to hire. Kai then tells you the words you somehow knew they\u2019d say: \u201cI think I know how to solve your problem.\u201d\n        Over the next month, you and Kai transform the abandoned General Store into a small, but vibrant, tech center. With grant money Kai got from the state, a loan from your startup, and hundreds of hours of shared time, you two have worked together to build something exciting.\n        You wrote a curriculum program, an onboarding plan, and designed a career path for your new hires. Currently, more than a third of the island\u2019s population is getting some kind of continuing education at your new center. With the promise of a lucrative remote job on the line, people have lined up to join Kai\u2019s training program and work for your startup.\n        The fact that people can now be paid for work that they are good at while continuing to live in the beautiful and isolated world of the island has the power to change everything. There is always so much more work to be done. The island\u2019s financial ecosystem is still delicate, not everyone enjoys the sudden changes that Kai\u2019s tech center has brought to the island, and you are worried about your new employees' ability to complete the demanding work. \n        However, for the first time in years, you feel sincerely hopeful. You have found the things you didn\u2019t even know you were looking for \u2014 an accepting community and a partner you trust."}

","targets":"       Twenty-thousand years ago, a man named Grog was living his best life. The world, or in his case, the cave, was his oyster. He was the twenty-eight-year-old leader of a community of two dozen other cave people in a cavern system on the edge of a mountain range. Grog was a large caveman with broad shoulders and an even broader forehead. While many of the cave women in their community would have given their best rock to be with Grog, he only had eyes for his wife, Sheshe. For Grog, life was wonderful. He had a beautiful spouse, the best sleeping spot in the cavern, and a dutiful teenage son named Togo. But all of this changed when Krak came to the cave.\n        Early one morning, Grog awoke to find a cluster of his cave followers gathered at the opening of the cavern. He pushed his way through the crowd and soon came face-to-face with a caveman he had never seen before. This caveman had a mop of messy red hair and was small and thin. Grog wasted no time in clarifying his position in the community.\n        \u201cMe Grog. Big man here. Who you?\u201d Grog said.\n        \u201cMe Krak. Come from far mountain. Now I here. Help you,\u201d said Krak. \n        \u201cHow help?\u201d Grog raised one bushy eyebrow in suspicion.\n        \u201cMe a make doer. Me make things. Things do.\u201d Krak said this while pulling a small object from inside his loincloth. He held out a pale white rock. He then walked over to the communal fire. It had burned out in the early morning hours and had not yet been lit again. He squatted down and took the small rock, striking it against another rock and creating a bright spark. The cave people gasped. Grog stared at Krak in shock.\n       Grog\u2019s community knew that certain types of rocks could cast off sparks for fire. But this task was frequently tedious, taking them at least fifteen minutes each morning to light a new fire. Krak had managed to light a fire with only one or two strikes of his rock. A crowd gathered around Krak, touching his arms and patting his head in approval. Grog heard some of the women in the back discussing how handsome the new stranger was.\n       Grog stormed off to his family\u2019s section of the cavern in a huff. He sat down next to Sheshe and Togo with his arms crossed over his chest. His wife grunted softly and handed him a partially eaten hyena leg. He feigned a smile at her and munched away in concern, watching as Krak continued his celebrity tour around the cavern.\n       The next day, Grog awoke to find Togo missing. He walked back towards the cave entrance and saw a crowd gathered for the second day in a row. Of course, Krak was at the center, but this time Togo was right next to him.\n       Krak had a handful of what looked like strips of elk skin in his hands, twisted into an elaborate pattern. Togo held one end of the twisted strips. Krak took the other end of the strips and looped it over a piece of rock jutting out from the top of the cave wall, tying the end to another rock on the floor. \n       \u201cThis rope,\u201d Krak said, giving a tug on the strips in Togo\u2019s hands. \u201cMake do up. Go high.\u201d\n       Togo grinned and began pulling himself up with the strange sinewy strings. Applause erupted from the gathered crowd. Several of the single cave women approached Krak in loving embraces. Krak put his arms around them, beaming in triumph over his latest invention. \n       Grog stepped through the group and pushed Krak to the side. \u201cTogo!\u201d he yelled. \u201cGet down. Up bad. Snap leg. Snap arm. Make head crack.\u201d Grog hit his fist hard against the cave wall to show Togo he was serious. Togo reluctantly climbed down the rope and skulked off back to the family home. \n       Grog then turned to Krak, shoving his large and meaty finger in Krak\u2019s face and saying, \u201cYou make son go up. Up bad. Rope break. Then Togo break. Then Sheshe and Grog sad. You stay away.\u201d \n       With that said, Grog went back to his wife and son. Grog intensely disliked this newcomer now. He had endangered Grog\u2019s son and not even apologized for it. Grog went out for a hunt with some of his friends early the next morning to get his mind off of the situation.\n       After a frustrating and failed chase of a mastodon, Grog and his hunter friends returned to the community. Grog waved at Togo halfheartedly as the young man gave a reluctant wave back. Togo was apparently still mad at his father for what happened yesterday. Grog went into the cavern and went straight to his family home.\n       He was shocked by the scene that then unfolded before his eyes. Sheshe was completely naked and standing, hands on her hips, in front of their fire. Krak was across from her, scraping at the wall with a small piece of charcoal. He had nearly finished recreating a rudimentary image of Sheshe in full nude glory on the cave wall, surrounded by a field of wildflowers and a mountain peak behind her. \n       \u201cGrog!\u201d Sheshe yelled out, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cLook! I am here. But I am on wall. Krak make me live on wall!\u201d \n       Krak turned to Grog with the same grin on his face he had sported the day before and said, \u201cI make do a story stick. Make Sheshe in story. I call it art. Now Sheshe art.\u201d\n       \u201cGrog!\u201d Sheshe shouted. \u201cNow Sheshe art!\u201d\n       \u201cKrak leave! Grog no want Krak here. Go back to own cave!\u201d \n       Krak looked at Grog with a quizzical expression. He spoke softly but clearly to Grog. \u201cKrak like cave here. Krak like people in cave. Krak like Sheshe. Krak is make doer. Grog make nothing. Maybe Grog leave.\u201d\n       \u201cGrog!\u201d Sheshe yelled again. \u201cNow Sheshe art!\u201d\n       \u201cYes, Sheshe. You art. Me heard you first time.\u201d Grog was furious now. First, this red-headed stranger had nearly hurt his son, and now he was fraternizing with his wife!\n       Grog stomped off into the recesses of the cave. He would not have his position usurped by some newcomer with fancy hair. Grog was brawny, but he could also have brains like Krak. He could be a make doer too.\n       A few hours later, Krak was relaxing by the communal fire at the front of the cavern. He had a cave woman on each arm, and another one was outside putting together a bowl of berries for him. Several of the men were seated across from Krak as he told them of his public shaming of Grog. In his version of the story, Grog had run away, sobbing loudly. The cavemen and women thought this part of the story was particularly humorous. \n       Suddenly, a loud whirring punctuated by a periodic thunk could be heard in the back of the cavern, rapidly approaching the entrance. Krak turned his head towards the noise and saw Grog standing straight and tall ten feet behind him.\n       Grog yelled, \u201cGrog is make doer. Grog make special gift for Krak. It called a slingem smashy.\u201d\n       Apparently, Grog had figured out an invention of his own. Using a few of the flint stones and rope from Krak, paired with a large rock he had found in the back of the cavern, he had constructed a mace. As Grog walked closer to the entrance, he used the rope to swing the large, shard-laden rock in a loop around his head.\n       \u201cTime Krak go home!\u201d Grog shouted above the scurrying of cave people as they ran away from his weaponized rock. \n       \u201cYes. Grog right. Goodbye different cave people,\u201d said Krak quickly.\n       And with that, Krak sprinted out of the cavern, never to be seen again."}

Her family was well off enough to have cows, goats, and sheep \u2013 along with enough relatives to fill a farmstead and then some. Everyone who was able worked in every part of the dairy farm, from milking to making. Once you could hold a pail steady for someone else, you were expected to contribute.  Even if you broke an arm, you could still teach the unoccupied youngsters, keep records, or handle trade with other families.\n        Katya\u2019s family had been dairy farmers for centuries, back when Mirsk was a village and had not yet grown into a town. A few generations back, her blessed great-great-grandmother had invested in a cellar, the better to store products to keep them from going bad. At that point, the town elders had decreed that all of her family would focus on dairy for the townsfolk.\n        It was like that in her town; indeed, it was like that in their entire nation. Folk would be born into a family with a profession, and would spend their lives in that profession, because tradition dictated it. Jorgen was a blacksmith because his mother had been, and her father, and so on. Misha the baker had a similar story, and so did everyone in town.\n        \u201cStability and tradition,\u201d the elders often said, \u201care the cornerstones of our town of Mirsk, and our nation of Byelobrad. To change things is to risk famine, or worse.\u201d\n        Winters were long, growing seasons short, and while there was grazing for the animals, it was a roll of the dice whether there would be enough grazing for the animals to produce butter and cream for everyone in town, or they\u2019d make do with milk during the lean months. \n        Katya \u2013 like all the children of Byelobrad \u2013 had learned how to read, write, and count. She loved her family, but she loved writing and reading nearly as much, and more so than the goats or cows. But she hadn\u2019t been born to the scholars in Mirsk, so in the eyes of the elders, what she wanted to do didn\u2019t matter.\n        \u201cKatya!\u201d her aunt Kisa barked. \u201cThat butter won\u2019t churn itself. Where\u2019s your head now?\u201d Kisa wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest person in the family, but she\u2019d been in charge of making the butter now for a decade, and in her domain, she was empress.\n        \u201cSorry, Aunt Kisa,\u201d Katya said, ducking her head and getting back into the rhythm of churning. \n        Katya could feel her aunt narrowing her eyes, though Katya was focused on the churn. Unless something distracted Kisa soon, Katya\u2019s aunt would unload whatever angry bile she\u2019d stored up, and Katya would most likely be the target.\n        \u201cHow was my writing for the recipe for the sheep\u2019s butter, Aunt Kisa?\u201d Katya had the best handwriting of any in the family, and Grandmother Lukya decreed that she would be the one to write down all the family\u2019s records, in case another plague struck the town.\n        A moment passed, then two. Kisa grudgingly allowed, \u201cLegible. Concise. Accurate.\u201d She then turned away from Katya, muttering but clearly not ready to begin a tirade against her niece. Instead, she turned her vitriol on a churn that had cracked a few days ago, swearing at the inanimate wood about needing to buy a new churn since it had been so faithless as to break while she was making a batch of the sheep\u2019s butter.\n        Katya was about to quietly breathe a sigh of relief when the door to the buttery opened, and Misha, her youngest nephew, called out, \u201cA crier\u2019s going round, someone\u2019s come to visit the town! The elders want everyone to meet in the town square!\u201d As he closed the door, he called out, \u201cGotta tell the rest of the family!\u201d\n        Kisa planted her hands on her hips, and announced, \u201cWell, no helping this. Get done with what you\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ll gather the family. The elders probably want an assembly.\u201d One by one, they finished as best as they were able, stored butter and buttermilk in sealed vats, and gathered near the road where the rest of Katya\u2019s family had already assembled. Together, the twenty-six of them walked the short distance into town. Gossip was already flying fast among the adults as to why the elders would have called a meeting now, instead of waiting until the next rest day.\n        Katya was old enough to walk with the adults, though she spent most of her time with them listening to speculation that ranged from the faintly worrisome to the mostly absurd. The emperor hadn\u2019t called for a tax increase in a few years, Katya knew, and wasn\u2019t likely to. Also, dragons hadn\u2019t been sighted in a century, so Katya wondered why Uncle Vanyes would bring up the subject. She resolved to keep her eyes, ears, and mind open, and her mouth shut. Someone would probably need to remember and record the events of the assembly for her family.\n        The town square was nearly full to capacity, but tradition required every family to have room to stand or sit as needed. Katya yielded her seat to Aunt Kisa, who arched an eyebrow but sat without complaint. \u201cThe family will need someone to see and listen,\u201d she explained, and watched Kisa\u2019s eyebrows briefly fly upward, then down into a frown.\n        \u201cYou think this is more than just taxes?\u201d her aunt asked.\n        \u201cHow often has this happened, Aunt Kisa? Like this, with all the townsfolk here? And there\u2019s a strange woman pacing the stage. She\u2019s not in the emperor\u2019s colors, and there\u2019s that curious staff she doesn\u2019t seem to be using to help her walk.\u201d\n        Kisa sighed and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a brain, child. Most likely this won\u2019t affect us, since everyone needs milk and butter. But keep your eyes open. We don\u2019t want surprises.\u201d \n        Katya silently reminded herself that to Aunt Kisa, everyone was a child, whether they\u2019d seen twenty summers, or forty, or sixty. The woman had given her a set of fountain pens for her twenty-third name day last year! But there was no use arguing with Kisa, so instead she turned her attention to the woman walking around the stage. The woman kept looking at the crowd, seeming interested in everyone there.\n        Katya was a bit too far from the stage to make out any fine detail; the woman seemed older than her but younger than her Aunt Kisa, certainly not old enough to need a staff to help her walk. Her clothes were fancy enough that Katya would have taken her for a merchant, but something about them seemed different in a way that made Katya long to get a closer look.\n        The town elders filed onto the stage and waited for the crowd to fall silent. Elder Krenik raised his hands, and announced, \u201cOur visitor today is named Lisbet! You will give her your undivided attention!\u201d\n        She\u2019s not from Byelobrad, not with a name like that, Katya thought. And the elders should have said her profession.\n        The woman stepped forward and bowed formally to the townsfolk. \u201cGreetings to you, folk of Mirsk.\u201d Her lightly accented voice easily reached the far corners of the town square, even though Katya was certain that she wasn\u2019t shouting. \u201cI come to you first from the nation of Oleppa to the west, and more recently from Emperor Nikholai\u2019s court. He has granted me a writ of access for all the towns and cities in Byelobrad, to come to you and offer a chance to take on a new profession.\u201d\n        Katya heard the entire crowd gasp. New professions were unheard of, at least within the past century or more. The last one Katya knew for sure had been approved was associated with the printing presses that had come to Byelobrad a century and a half ago.\n        Lisbet waited for the crowd to quiet down, and continued. \u201cI know this comes as a shock, but I ask you to hear me out. When I went to the Emperor, he heard my request and granted it without hesitation.\u201d \n        The crowd began murmuring, and Katya felt a bit faint. Like everyone, she had read the official histories. Immediate approval by the Emperor or Empress had happened fewer than five times in all of Byelobrad\u2019s existence. Whatever this profession was, the Emperor clearly thought it was important enough to upset long-standing tradition.\n        Lisbet smiled. \u201cAnd so I come to you, Mirsk, first on my journey though other cities and towns were closer.\u201d She paused to let this sink in. Katya wondered with a touch of cynicism whether it was true or simply showmanship.\n        \u201cBehold!\u201d Lisbet announced, and lifted her staff so that it pointed into the air. A bluish-green ball of light sprang into existence above the woman, and the outcry from the townsfolk was enough to make Katya clap her hands over her ears. \n        Even through the noise of hundreds of people, Lisbet could still be heard. \u201cMagic is real! Many have studied it, learned how it works, and learned how to work with it. And now I bring this opportunity to you, citizens of Mirsk!\u201d She spun the tip of her staff in a tight circle, and the ball of light flew out across the crowd, moving well above their heads. \u201cDo not fear, this is a spell of seeking! It will find those who have the potential to join this new profession, ones the Emperor has allowed me to call magicians.\u201d\n        While Lisbet spoke, the ball stopped several times, floated for a moment above certain people\u2019s heads, and left a bit of itself behind. Maxim, the youngest of his family of bakers, shrieked in joy as the light marked him. Ilsa, one of the older bankers, very nearly fainted. One by one, the light stopped above the heads of people young and old, and marked them as having potential.\n        And Katya could not find any surprise when the light marked her.\n        She was the last; fifteen people of Mirsk had been marked, and all of them were caught up in emotions ranging from shock and fear to delight and excitement. Katya stared up at the light bobbing above her head. It reminded her of a painting she saw once, showing a great expanse of water that people called an ocean.\n        \u201cHear me now, people of Mirsk,\u201d Lisbet said over the rumblings from various townsfolk. \u201cThis indicates potential only. It does not mean that any of your people can immediately do magic. It takes a great deal of training to open up to the flows, much less do anything with them. Your Emperor has granted me one last boon: the choice. Those who have been marked may choose whether to stay in their profession or come with me, with no consequences for the people or their families levied by the elders or the Emperor.\u201d\n        The crowd went almost perfectly still, with the only sound coming from the miller Gretl\u2019s newborn babe, yowling in hunger. It was one thing to be chosen for a new profession, but tradition demanded that a family be compensated in some way for the loss. Katya knew the stories of how families were punished for breaking tradition, even if the Emperor himself approved.\n        Katya looked to her Aunt Kisa. The woman stared at her with a flat expression, and Katya mentally resigned herself to staying with her family and tending the dairy farm to the end of her days.\n        Then her aunt shook her head and waved her hands, shooing Katya toward the stage. Into the growing sounds of the townsfolk talking at each other, she said, \u201cYour mother would be proud of you. Just see if Lisbet will let you finish those records for us, yes?\u201d"}

I would like to say that I remember the movie, but I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on the details. I mean, I remember there was some sort of dance off, and the new guy wins, thus liberating the town from boredom. \n        If Colin Firth or Tom Hanks came to town and was like, \u201cYo! I\u2019m here to shake things up,\u201d I would be all for it, because I mean it\u2019s Colin and Tom. Moreover, they\u2019re not likely to bring bad tidings. However, that isn\u2019t how things roll in real life. Events don\u2019t happen with a great actor, good intentions, and a brilliant soundtrack. Instead, they are usually brought about by really annoying people like Marcy.\n        Maaaaaaaaarcy, as my group of friends at the pub pronounce her name. Before Marcy, life was good. It\u2019s peaceful here in Leafton, a small town located in the Northeast Corridor. Granted, it can get boring at times. I work remotely for a large company in the city just south of us. Most of my week is taken up with work. On the weekends, I stroll into town and enjoy getting coffee at Jennie\u2019s during the day, or sometimes come instead during the evening for a beer at our local pub, Timber. If I want to, I can hop the train and go into the city, but usually I just opt to take my dog for a walk and read. Every couple of weeks, I go to Sasha\u2019s beauty salon for a mani pedi, and massage.\n        Into this tranquil routine enters Marcy from stage right. Completely unwelcome. Boo. Marcy is, how do I say it nicely? Well, if I ever see her flying around on a broom, I just won\u2019t be surprised. I can hear her cackle-exclaiming in her high pitched voice \u201cI\u2019ll get you my pub dweller, and your rather large dog too!\u201d A wicked witch to be sure. \n        Marcy\u2019s husband is the head of the new timber industry just outside of town. He\u2019s gone all the time, and so she has a lot of money, no imagination, and time to kill. A lethal combination. Marcy decided that our town is too forward-thinking, and that we need to go back to the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days.\u201d \n        I\u2019m never sure for whom these days were supposedly good, but the changes Marcy wants are not good for anyone in the town, save for herself and the ladies of the clique who are just Marcy clones. They even dress alike, as if they buy everything from the same catalog. Which, now that I think about it, they probably do. Ever since Marcy arrived, they are all about acting like her, and getting into her good graces. It\u2019s like high school when everyone wants to be friends with the lead cheerleader, just because of her position. Marcy\u2019s husband is rich, and clone-like people want to be her friend.\n        The first thing she did was to get a spot on the town council. The council has no legal power. However, it does influence what happens socially in town, especially amongst the Marcy clones. I never go to any of those meetings anyway. They put out trivial proclamations in the town newspaper, post them around common areas, and leave them on your car windshield.  These edicts are not legally binding (so far), but nonetheless irksome. Until they are officially enforced, they are ignored by my group of friends and me. My favorite one so far is dogs can no longer be walked in the town park after 9:00am. \n        Alas, many trees die for these decrees to be posted about the town. But, whatever, the sheriff can give me a ticket when he is not walking his dog there. I often have a hot dog with him from the local stand, and we both give our dogs a little piece. Life goes on in spite of Marcy, the clones, and their flyers from on high.\n        One day, Marcy decides to take her little power trip too far. She and her clones went to the town clerk with a proposition that all families need to donate a baked good, homemade, at all town events to be used as a fundraiser for their council. Nice try, oh flying one, I don\u2019t bake. It\u2019s my good deed to the world to forgo baking. If I submit a baked good, people will pay not to eat it. Though, that itself is a great fundraising idea. The idea of enforced baking might sound funny, however, they have enough signatures to get it on the ballot. I shudder at the thought. \n        As it turns out, Marcy and her clones win the battle, enforced baking is up for vote in our next election, which is only a few weeks away. In my head I shout to myself, they shall not win this war!\n        Dance off, it is. Because, I\u2019ll be\u2026 well, since I\u2019m in public, let me just say that I\u2019m not going to let this proposal win. We are not back in the 1950s, and I\u2019m not baking to fund the activities of Marcy and her clones. I mean, I\u2019m not baking full stop, but I\u2019m also not going to buy a cake at the store and try and pass that off as my own.\n        I need to mobilize some like-minded people. The best place for anti-1950s feelings here is good old Timber\u2019s. As I walk in, I see my group already talking to the bartender, Sam. Most of what\u2019s being said should not be repeated, but the bottom line is no one wants to bake to support Marcy and clones\u2019 proclamation posting.\n        I order a beer and join in the fray. It\u2019s lit! \n        Doug is yelling, \u201cIf I get one more note on my truck to wash it before parking in town, I\u2019m going to lose it! I work for your husband Maaaaaarcy, my truck gets dirty running supplies to the various work areas. Get over it!\u201d\n        \u201cYesterday, I was getting my haircut, and one of the clones told me I should be ashamed of myself, coming to the salon dressed in jeans and a t-shirt! Sorry, clones, I am not wearing dress clothes to get my hair done!\u201d said Terri.\n        Chrissy chimed in, \u201cOne of them saw me buying some frozen dinners at the store. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t have a heart attack. Sorry ladies, I don\u2019t always have time to cook for myself.\u201d \n        \u201cWell, I illicitly buy hot dogs for my dog at the park after 9am. So many trees die for these proclamations we ruthlessly ignore!\u201d I say. We all laugh as we make a mock toast in memory of the trees.\n        I mean, it\u2019s all fun and games until you are about to be forced to bake to fund these annoyances. We agree that there is only one thing that we can do to fix this problem. We need to get out the vote! Our rally cry will be, \u201cVote no to enforced baking!\u201d \n        Sam has agreed to print flyers for us to put around the town. We all feel sorry for the poor trees, again called to sacrifice for Marcy and the clones. Doug volunteered to drop them off at the various work locations he goes to during the week. Chrissy and I will post the flyers around the town, and Terri agreed to take some when she goes to the parents\u2019 meeting at the school tomorrow. But for tonight, we are having another round together to enjoy the company of good friends and excellent battle plans.\n        We\u2019re not going to bake without a fight! We start to sing together \u201cwe\u2019re not going to bake it! No, we ain\u2019t gonna bake it!\u201d Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re all taking cabs home.\n        Election day is finally here, my friends. All of us are at the pub with Sam. The polls have just closed. Results will be announced any minute on the news, which we are all attentively watching. Commercials. Ugh. Then we have a good laugh, because one of them is about a cake that tastes \u201cjust like grandma used to make.\u201d \n        The newscaster begins to announce the results. We wait with bated breath. Silence falls over the pub. Then it is finally proclaimed by the newscaster, it is a landslide no for the enforced baking proposal. \n        A resounding cheer echoes through the pub! We\u2019re all so happy. To celebrate, Sam gives us a round of champagne on the house. Victory is ours! We raise a glass, no one will be baking tonight. \n\n\n\n"}
{"example_id":"example_005","inputs":"Write a 1,350 word story where the character meets another version of themselves. The story must be written in the first person. The narrator is a teenage girl. In her world, interdimensional travel is very common. The protagonist is angry at her father for not letting her experience interdimensional travel since all of her friends have already tried it. She visits the alternate dimension without his permission and meets an alternate version of herself. In this encounter, she learns a family secret that contextualizes her father's concerns. ","targets":"        Sitting across the table from an almost identical version of myself was just as uncanny as everyone had told me it would be.\n        \u201cThis is so weird!\u201d D3 me and I both said the words at the exact same time. Then we laughed.\n        Of course, I knew this unison-speaking thing was pretty typical when two identical beings from different dimensions met for the first time. Stace, Noops, and pretty much all of my other friends had told me all about their own first meet ups with their D3 selves. Plus, people were always posting online about their \u201cfirst meet\u201d stories. I was more than ready for this whole experience, and my D3 self was too.\n        I was the last person in my friend group to visit myself in the D3 dimension. My best friend, Stace, got her own interdimensional travel device (IDT) and visited her D3 self when she was only 13. By sophomore year, everyone had their own IDT and got to hang out in D3 whenever they wanted. They\u2019d brag about how cool it was to see their own lives in a slightly different dimension. Some of my friends thought their D3 identities were awesome and started hanging out in D3 all the time. Some of them got bored with their D3 selves and only visited a few times a year. But everyone I knew had at least been to D3 to check it out. I was the only person in my whole class who hadn\u2019t even tried using an ITD.\n        Stace has hung out with her D3 self almost every day. Last week, she even made out with her D3\u2019s boyfriend. Apparently, her D3 was cool with it. I asked her why she has a boyfriend in D3 but not in our reality. She told me that her D3 boyfriend is a 3-only-er. Basically, that means that he is one of those people who exists in D3 but not in our reality. I don\u2019t actually understand why every person in our reality has a D3 duplicate, but there are lots of people in D3 who don\u2019t have a copy in our world. I know that the interdimensionalists have a whole theory about it, but anytime my Dad tries to explain it to me, I get totally lost. I mean, I don\u2019t actually understand how any of the interdimensional stuff works. To be honest, I don\u2019t even understand how my cell phone works, so I don\u2019t overthink it.\n        I was only able to get to D3 because Stace let me borrow her ITD. I was a little nervous, because I knew my Dad was going to lose his mind when he found out. My Dad is an interdimensional scholar, and way back in the day before he met my mom, he was on one of the teams that helped develop the first ITDs. He\u2019s one of the only people to ever travel via ITD to D2. I don\u2019t know what he saw there. He has never talked about it. However, it must have been bad.\n        Back in 3rd grade, when ITDs were just starting to become pretty mainstream, we had a guest speaker visit our class to teach us about D2. While D3 is very similar to our reality (D1), the D2 reality is super messed up. I\u2019m not great with multidimensional history, but I do know that in D2, some kind of nuclear warfare totally destroyed a few major cities about 100 years ago. People in D2 were resilient, and they have a pretty functional system again, but D1 people have to be very careful about spending too much time in D2 because of the radiation.\n        I understood that Dad was freaked out about D2, but the modern IDTs couldn\u2019t even access D2 and D3 was totally safe. Everyone, and I mean everyone, owned at least one IDT, but my dad refused to let me even try using one. He had this whole monologue about how, \u201conce we open that door, we can\u2019t close it\u201d and \u201cwe must learn to live in our own reality before we can embrace another.\u201d It was infuriating. I tried to debate with him. I mean, I didn\u2019t push too hard when I was younger. I got that my Dad wasn\u2019t cool with little kids wandering around new dimensions by themselves, but now I was almost 16. I was ready. Visiting D3 had become a rite of passage. I was annoyed that my dad, who had been to the way scarier D2, wouldn\u2019t even consider letting me take a quick trip to D3.\n        Finally, I decided to break Dad\u2019s dumb rule and borrow Stace\u2019s IDT. I plugged in the coordinates, hit the transport button, and appeared in a room that looked just like my own kitchen. The clock was on the opposite wall and the curtains were green instead of purple. I saw myself across the room. The D2 me was wearing a cute outfit and had a haircut that was just a few inches shorter than mine. She was super excited I had finally visited. All of her friends had already met their D1 counterparts, and she had been worried that I'd never appear.\n        We had a really nice time hanging out. D3 me brought me to her room, which looked just like mine, but some of the pictures on the wall were different. We played some music for each other. She had never listened to K-pop before, and she really liked the BTS songs I played for her. She also played some really cool songs for me that sounded kind of jazzy but had a really cool bassline. Stace had told me that the music scene in D3 had a great vibe, and I totally agreed. \n        After about an hour, I told my D3 self that I had to get home.\n        \u201cYou worried about what Dad is going to say?\u201d D3 me asked me.\n        \u201cYeah. Is Dad weird about IDTs in this reality too?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cYeah, but you know why,\u201d D3 me said,\n        \u201cNo. I mean, I know he had a bad experience in D2, and it got him all freaked out about IDTs,\u201d I said.\n        \u201cYeah, but he told you about what happened to him in D2, right?\u201d she asked with a tone that made me suddenly feel cold.\n        \u201cNo. He never told me,\u201d I said, hoping I sounded calmer than I felt.\n        D3 me took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a real bummer. You want to hear?\u201d she asked.\n        I nodded and she told me a story. Apparently, my D1 dad had visited her D3 dad only once, thirteen years ago. \n        Apparently, when my D1 dad traveled to D2, he met his D2 self. My dad found out that, in the D2 reality, my D2 mom was still alive. But, the D2 version of me had recently died in some kind of dramatic and painful way, right in front of the D2 dad. It messed my D1 dad up really badly to realize that the only reality that his wife still existed in was one without his daughter.\n        \u201cI had no idea,\u201d I told my D3 self. She nodded.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to process,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and talk to him.\u201d \n        \u201cHe is super annoying, but my dad loves me,\u201d D3 me said.\n        \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I responded. I reached across the table. My D3 took my hand.\n        \u201cI\u2019ve known about D2 for a long time. Mom exists somewhere that I can\u2019t go. It really hurts. And knowing that I\u2019m dead in D2 but alive in D3 makes my brain feel fuzzy. But this is good. This is the first time I\u2019ve talked about it. Will you come back and let me know how it goes with your dad?\u201d D3 asked.\n        \u201cOf course. This has been really weird but really cool. I\u2019ll come back soon,\u201d I responded.\n        I hit the transport button on my IDT and faded back into my reality, ready to have the first grown up conversation of my life with my dad."}

With a brain clouded by love and full of masculine boldness, he knew he would come out on top.\n        Henry threw on his robe, made of lush red velvet and lined with bear fur, and took a long swig from his wine goblet sitting on the mahogany table next to his bed. Wiping his mouth on his sleeve, he pulled on his stockings and walked into the den across from his bedchamber. \n        Henry could feel the muscles of his calves pulling the stockings taut across his legs as he moved through the room. At the age of 41, most men his age had slowed down and fattened up. But Henry had kept his figure lithe and tight. An active outdoorsman, he spent most of his free time, when not with Anne, hunting, jousting, and roughhousing with his many nobleman friends. \n        Henry stepped across the Oriental rug to his favorite armchair near the fire in his den. He had taken the rug as a spoil of war after the Battle of the Spurs in Northeastern France. Apparently, it was well over 200 years old and had been taken centuries before by some French soldiers during the Crusades in the Middle East. While Henry, as a well-educated man, could appreciate the rug\u2019s rich history, he mainly kept it, as with many of his treasures, as a symbol of his power on and off the battlefield.\n        As Henry approached his armchair in front of the roaring fire, he came to a sudden stop, dropping the half-full goblet of wine and spilling red across the rug. In the middle of his armchair, only 3 feet away, sat a very large man. Just as he was about to call for his night guards, the man yelled out, \u201cCome over here, Henry, and have a seat!\u201d\n        Instantly, Henry knew that this man was no enemy or even a stranger. This man was... himself. He cautiously approached the armchair, slid into it slowly, and gazed at the man in front of him.\n        The man had to weigh at least 300 pounds. His legs jutted out from a large belly, and one of his legs had obviously been bandaged heavily under his stockings. The man\u2019s hands were massive, adorned with ornate rings that made his fingers swell slightly. He was dressed in rich clothing that showed his status. The young Henry could not help himself. He reached out to touch his older self, only to watch his hand move through the figure like a horse running through fog.\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t feel me, Henry. I am you, but I am also very dead. I am from the other world, and wanted to see you and tell you of the life ahead,\u201d the older Henry stated. \n        Young Henry was still not entirely sure if this apparition was real or simply a fever dream that he would soon wake up from. But as he was already here, he figured he would hear out this phantom.\n        \u201cSpeak, ghost,\u201d young Henry said, leaning back into his chair.\n        The older Henry spoke plainly and clearly, \u201cYour current wife, unfortunately, will not be the true love you had hoped for. You will grow tired of her intelligence, which will challenge your patience and manhood. But to avoid another divorce, you will accuse her of treason and incest with her own brother. All of these charges will not be true, and deep down, you will know this. You will have her arrested, and, ultimately, you will have her beheaded.\u201d \n        The young Henry scoffed incredulously at this shocking tale. He spoke to his older self and said, \u201cIt is impossible for me to believe that I would behead my own wife. And what will become of our son?\u201d\n        \u201cYour son will not be born by Anne Boleyn. She will birth you a daughter in one week\u2019s time. Your son will be born by another wife,\u201d said the older Henry.\n        \u201cAnother wife? This must be a farce. How many wives will I have?\" shouted young Henry.\n        \u201cWell, let me recall the order here.\u201d The older Henry narrowed his eyes, and counted on his fingers. \u201cDivorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived. Six wives in total.\u201d \n        \u201cThis tale you weave, sir, is outrageous. How could my reign possibly survive this ridiculous behavior?\" asked young Henry.\n        \u201cAs you age and become larger in girth, you will become more fearsome to those around you. I would say to lay off the kidney pies and mutton legs, but I know you will not listen,\u201d said the older Henry. \n        \u201cI am fearful of this future of heartbreak that you speak of, but at least six wives will guarantee me a son at some point,\u201d said young Henry.\n        \u201cYes. You will have a son to take the throne. But he will take your greatest love, Jane Seymour, on the day of his birth. And he will only outlive you six years, dying before he even reaches adulthood,\u201d said the older Henry solemnly.\n        Young Henry let out a groan. \u201cYou mean to tell me that all of that death and divorce will have been for nothing? And that the Tudor dynasty will die with me? Or worse, that it will be winnowed out when my oldest daughter Mary weds some foreign king and gives over the country to another?\u201d \n        \u201cNot at all. In fact, that is the main reason I am here today.\u201d The older Henry leaned forward in his seat, his eyes glistening. \u201cYou see, as a spirit from the other world, I can see the future beyond my own death. And our legacy is one of unexpected glory. Anne Boleyn, the woman who you will soon call the vilest of names, will bear you a daughter named Elizabeth. She will grow up in the shadow of her mother\u2019s execution and in the shadow of your fearsome figure. She will commit herself to the Church of England, even when her Catholic sister, Mary, threatens her very life for it. And she will learn the practices of statehood under the tutelage of your greatest advisors. She, and not a son, will take up the throne and refuse to give over one inch of British soil to any foreign-born king. Instead, she will devote every waking moment expanding this nation into an empire. She will be the Virgin Queen, and many a man will worship at her altar. But she will only ever have eyes for England.\u201d\n        The older Henry continued, \u201cIn a shift from your own obsession with passing on your bloodline, she will remain childless. Her legacy will be a golden age unrivaled in British history, and her children will be the citizenry of this land we call home.\u201d \n        Tears ran down young Henry\u2019s cheeks. His entire life had revolved around securing his throne. He had feared that his family line and the throne of England would always be under threat from without and within, just as it was with his father and his father\u2019s father before him. But to hear that this curse would be broken by none other than his daughter made his heart swell with pride. \n        Old Henry began to grow blurry around the edges. He said, \u201cNow, young man, I must go. We apparitions can never stay long. I wish I could tell you that you will remember this dream and the words that I have spoken. Like Cassandra, spirits are cursed to see the future but have no real power to change it. You are destined to live out your life exactly as I have stated it, but you will not remember this conversation. My ghostly friends have told me this venture of mine is pointless, but I hope that is not entirely true. Perhaps every once in a while, you will gain a small sliver of this vision in your deepest dreams. But perhaps I am also wrong to wish this. For in your indomitable figure, you will make Elizabeth desire the same for herself. In your commitment to the new faith, you will inspire her own beliefs. In your coldness, you will teach her to be strong when isolated. And in your ceaseless and painful quest for love, you will teach her that there is no greater love than between a parent and a child, and for Elizabeth, between a Queen and her nation.\u201d\n        Suddenly, young King Henry awoke drenched in an icy sweat in his bed. He could not recall the dream he had, only that it had been strange and somewhat terrifying. But soon enough, he drifted off back to sleep with a warm feeling that, ultimately, all would be right with the world in the end. "}

We met in grade school, and formed one of those friendship groups young adult novelists tend to love. Together, we weathered things together like puberty, first loves, and coming out. \n        In our senior year, we\u2019d all decided to go to Green Hills Community College to give ourselves some more time since we weren\u2019t sure what we wanted to do with our lives. Green Hills wasn\u2019t a bad college, but in October of our sophomore year, we realized none of us wanted to stay in the town for the rest of our lives \u2014 especially since the town was barely neutral on LGBTQIA matters.\n        \u201cHey Avery!\u201d Jonas called when he saw me come out of the library.\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I headed over to him, skirt swishing as I moved. Today was more of a \u201cgirl day,\u201d and thankfully the weather was still nice enough that an ankle length skirt wasn\u2019t an issue. We started walking toward the parking lot, heading for Jonas\u2019 car as the golden early afternoon light filtered through trees half bare of leaves.\n        \u201cMercy texted me since she knew you had your head down in school stuff, and told me there\u2019s a carnival in the lot where that developer tried to set up a second mall!\u201d He grinned, and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween, perfect for us to get dressed up and go, since everyone thinks we\u2019re too old to be trick-or-treating.\u201d \n        I nodded, at the very least intrigued by the idea. \u201cI\u2019m done with my midterms and caught up with homework, thank goodness. Kind of having a Something Wicked This Way Comes moment here, though. What kind of carnival sets up this late in the season? It\u2019s not called \u2018Dark\u2019s Pandemonium Carnival,\u2019 is it?\u201d\n        Laughing, Jonas responded, \u201cNah, it\u2019s called the \u2018Allston Family Carnival.\u2019 I Googled them, they\u2019re totally legit.\u201d\n        Grinning, I said, \u201cOkay, but if there\u2019s a guy named \u2018Mr. Dark\u2019 running the thing, I\u2019m noping out of there.\u201d\n        We\u2019d reached the edge of campus, and Mercy and Robin were waiting, holding hands and waving at us like they thought we wouldn\u2019t see them. They were an adorable couple, and had been since 10th grade when they came out, which didn\u2019t go over well with either of their families. Mercy\u2019s parents were strict Catholics who\u2019d only sort of accepted that their daughter wasn\u2019t interested in men, while Robin lived with her aunt and uncle after being kicked out by her ultra-conservative parents. \n        \u201cHey you two!\u201d Jonas called, and the two of them ran over and hugged me.\n        \u201cHow was the midterm?\u201d Mercy asked.\n        \u201cDid Jacobs get on your case about the skirt?\u201d Robin said at nearly the same time. The two of them pulled back a bit from me and giggled.\n        \u201cMidterm went fine, I think I aced it, and Jacobs kept looking, but it\u2019s not like I was wearing a mini or something she could get upset about.\u201d I danced a bit in place, and added, \u201cShe\u2019s so old school, but she\u2019s the best public speaking teacher on the campus. I just have to get through the semester with her.\u201d\n        \u201cSo, carnival?\u201d Robin asked, bouncing a bit in place.\n        \u201cYes, carnival,\u201d I answered with a grin. \u201cLet\u2019s get together around seven o\u2019clock?\u201d At their agreement, we all piled into Jonas\u2019 car, so he could take us back to our respective houses.\n        Right at seven, Jonas showed up at my door, dressed like a stereotypical pirate. I\u2019d dithered for an hour or two before putting on the black cat costume I\u2019d gotten in a moment of bravery. Form fitting, it required some added pieces underneath, but in the end I looked like Julie Newmar as Catwoman from the old Batman television shows. My parents were one hundred percent supportive of my gender identity. We\u2019d had discussions lately about whether it was time to move out of Green Hills and to somewhere safer.\n        Dad gave me a thumbs up as he opened the door for Jonas, who whistled at me. \u201cI\u2019m not into girls, but you look fantastic Avery.\u201d\n        I blushed. \u201cThanks! Let\u2019s do this before I lose my nerve.\u201d\n        Mercy was dressed in a proper Greek peplos, and said that people probably wouldn\u2019t recognize she was going as Sappho, but she didn\u2019t care. Robin had a short brunette wig and a tennis skirt and top, declaring that she was Billie Jean King for the night. Once we were all out of the car, Mercy and Robin hugged me again, complimented me on my costume, and swore they wouldn\u2019t leave my side for an instant. \n        We purchased admission from a man who looked like he\u2019d seen it all several times, got our all-access wristbands, and wandered into a maze of booths and lights. I recognized a bunch of students from the college, and laughed in amazement when I saw the star quarterback and his cheerleader girlfriend dressed in each other\u2019s clothing.\n        I was about to point toward the food stalls when Jonas stopped dead and looked at me seriously. \u201cThere\u2019s a hall of mirrors over there by the food. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re up for going past it.\u201d\n        I paused. Mom had done a fantastic job with my makeup, and with my friends to support me, I thought I could probably handle going past. I got this warm feeling, and what came out of my mouth instead was, \u201cI think I\u2019m up for going in, actually.\u201d\n        Jonas, Mercy, and Robin all looked at me with surprise, but then the love and praise started flowing, and I felt myself buoyed along to the entrance, where a carnival barker grinned at us. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Sappho, Billie Jean King, Julie Newmar \u2013 fantastic choice, by the way \u2013 and young Blackbeard?\u201d\n        Mercy started giggling. \u201cThree out of four is really good, but I don\u2019t think Jonas, er, young Blackbeard here was going for a specific pirate.\u201d\n        The barker chuckled, and motioned us toward the entry. I was floating from the validation; at no point did he blink or frown or give any indication he thought I wasn\u2019t really a young woman. I felt Mercy tug me in, and both Jonas and Robin hugged me once we got inside.\n        In a really brave moment, I looked into the first mirror and saw a woman dressed up as Catwoman. I knew it was me, but I really did look a lot like her. I think I got distracted, though, because when I turned around to ask my friends about going further into the maze, they were all gone.\n        Before I could panic, I heard their voices up ahead. It was clear there was only one way through, and I guessed they\u2019d given me some privacy for a moment of gender euphoria. But as I went toward them, their voices began fading out, and the surrounding mirrors began reflecting different images of myself.\n        I saw myself as a young woman dressed as a flapper, a young man in a tuxedo with a mask and a red rose, a figure skater (male and female versions), and other variations. They all seemed to be costumes that I could have worn, but underneath all of them, it was still me with my green eyes and reddish hair. \n        \u201cJonas? Mercy? Robin?\u201d I called out, but only got silence in return.\n        I kept moving, in the hope that maybe they were just further ahead, and the images got more and more unusual. I saw myself as an elf-woman, pointed ears and all. Then, I was in a far-too-futuristic form fitting jumpsuit, with what looked like a laser gun, but not quite. Next, I was some kind of superhero, a haze of shimmering light surrounding my body. \n        These weren\u2019t reflections anymore. They were me, but alternate versions of me. I don\u2019t know why I knew that, and I wasn\u2019t sure why I accepted that so easily, but I was seeing how I might have been in different universes. My face mostly stayed the same, and I got the sense that no matter how I looked in those universes, I was genderfluid in all of them.\n        When I turned a corner, I found myself in a completely silent dead end. Ahead of me, the mirrors were empty except for one. I resolutely didn\u2019t look at the empty mirrors, suspecting those were universes where I wasn\u2019t around anymore.\n        They were dressed in tattered clothing, presenting mostly female, with what looked like a sword belted to one hip and a crystal rod on the other side. In their reflection, I could see the landscape behind them. It looked like every apocalyptic movie landscape I\u2019d ever seen, except the lighting was a dim red filtered through black clouds, occasionally punctuated by flashes of violet lightning.\n        My other self said, \u201cOh good, I got through to you. Quick, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d I realized that their voice was the first thing I\u2019d heard in a long time.\n        \u201cDo, do I call you Avery?\u201d\n        They smiled sadly. \u201cYeah, we picked the same name. Listen to me.\u201d They exhaled, and looked back over their shoulder. \u201cIn my universe, magic came back, all at once, about seven years ago. Mostly, it was good at first, but then countries started using magic to fight.\u201d They looked back again. \u201cSome of us realized that something bad had gotten in with the magic, and was using the wars to make itself stronger. We started calling that something the Enemy, because we didn\u2019t have any other name for it. By the time we started fighting the Enemy, it was pretty much too late.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat about Robin, Mercy, Jonas?\u201d\n        \u201cWe\u2019re still friends. We\u2019re the last people still fighting, and the Enemy finally tracked us down.\u201d They sighed. \u201cRobin suggested we try and warn alternate versions of ourselves, because we\u2019re pretty sure the Enemy goes from universe to universe, stirring up trouble and feeding off of it.\u201d\n        Instinctively, I reached out to the mirror. I wanted to pull my other self through, I wanted them to be safe.\n        They managed a smile. \u201cI wish that worked. There can only be one of us in any given universe. I still have ethics, and I\u2019m not going to stop you from existing just because I want to keep going.\u201d They looked around again. \u201cThe Enemy isn\u2019t far away, but I want to ask you something.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said quietly.\n        \u201cLet me pass on my knowledge and my experiences. I think the Enemy is coming for your universe next, and you\u2019ll need to be ready. We\u2019ll hold it off as long as we can, give you all enough time to prepare.\u201d They grinned suddenly. \u201cMy Jonas, Robin, and Mercy are making the same offers to yours.\u201d Tears started streaming down their face as they added, \u201cYour friends won\u2019t say yes unless you agree to it. I\u2019m glad you have them. My versions have made my life so much better in the midst of everything else. And this isn\u2019t a one-way thing; I\u2019ll get a copy of your memories. There has to be an equal exchange.\u201d\n        I felt the tears rolling down my face, and nodded. I wasn\u2019t sure I could do anything else.\n        The other Avery exhaled in relief. \u201cOkay, good. I\u2019m sorry, this is going to be really weird, but here goes.\u201d They took the crystal rod in their left hand, gently placed the tip against whatever surface was on their side, and said, \u201cMove your right hand, and touch the rod from your side.\u201d\n        Sniffling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve barely met you, and I\u2019m going to miss you, Avery.\u201d\n        \u201cLikewise, Avery,\u201d they answered, \u201cbut at least we\u2019ll be able to remember each other.\u201d\n        I pressed my hand up against the rod on their side, and for a moment, everything went black. All of their life, history, experiences, and knowledge flowed into me, parking itself in a neat little bundle at the back of my mind for when I was ready to start going through it.\n        \u201cThis is goodbye,\u201d they said. \u201cYour friends accepted too, so at least you\u2019re all in the same boat on this. We\u2019ll give you as much time as we can. Magic came back for us on Halloween, we\u2019ll try to make sure the Enemy can\u2019t get through this year.\u201d The image of my other self faded from the mirror, and what had seemed like a cul-de-sac faded away, replaced by an open space of mirrors reflecting me, here, now, the way I was dressed for Halloween. I blinked, and Robin reappeared, with Jonas and Mercy fading into view a split second later.\n        \u201cYou all got that?\u201d I asked. \n        My three friends nodded, looking shaken. \n        \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Robin suggested. \u201cMy aunt and uncle won\u2019t care if we go hang out at their place, as long as we leave the mother-in-law unit clean.\u201d\n        On our way out of the carnival, I saw storm clouds moving in. The memories of the other Avery assured me these were normal clouds, but the four of us looked at each other for a long moment.\n        \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Mercy assured me, and I nodded."}

An excellent work, from a time long before this one. I wake to find myself in a hospital. It is very sleek looking, with an over use of white. The medical screens and stark lights against the white floors and walls create a cold austere ambience. Presently, I am alone. \n        Nurse Venti, whom I saw yesterday, told me that I was in an accident and have amnesia. They told me a close friend of mine left a rectangular silver pad with the book on it for me to read. The pad is locked, and cannot be used to access anything other than the book. Dr. Rocketti told me that I am not allowed to access outside information yet.  He thinks it will be too jarring given my current medical condition. Amnesia is a tricky thing, he explained to me, it is best to let the brain heal slowly. However, he is allowing the pad with the book, since it is locked. \n        My friend is supposed to return this evening. I can wait that long for some answers. Dr. Rocketti refuses to answer any of my questions not directly related to medical facts about amnesia. He knows who I am as he spoke to my friend, I lack this knowledge about myself. I am a tabula rasa, a blank slate.\n        Dinner is underwhelming. Served upon a cold silver platter divided into sections, there is a concoction, that I assume is a vegetable stew of sorts, brown rice, and a roll. I also have some type of unidentifiable red juice and water. It was unceremoniously dropped onto the bed table by a grumpy person who clearly wanted to be doing anything else besides delivering my dinner. I feel like I need to eat, maybe it will help my brain heal. Healing requires food after all. I hold my breath as I take a bite.\n        I wake up and the friend I don\u2019t know is sitting beside my bed reading from their silver pad. They notice my movements and look over at me, \u201cHello, how are you feeling?\u201d I have no idea how I\u2019m feeling. My head hurts and I have stitches on the right side of my forehead. I feel lost from the amnesia. But, a desire to know who I am is perhaps the strongest feeling I have at the moment. We begin to talk, my friend and I.\n        It was not what I expected at all. This person is not my friend. I don\u2019t know them, I have never met them. They explained to me that they\u2019re a time traveling sorcerer, a travmage. They watch the timeline and try to make right where something went wrong. However, they cannot change the past, so their job is to try and fix the future by getting people who did wrong in the past to start doing good in the present. \n        According to the travmag, the people they target are usually persons of power, like dukes who own castles and are charged with the care of a village, persons with magical powers, influencers, political figures, rich people of the peerage, and other community leaders. People with the capacity to inflict great harm and suffering on others, or who could instead use their powers to help others flourish. Power is not always magical, sometimes it is political, social, or monetary.\n        I begin to feel uneasy. If a travmage is here with me it means I am probably not a good person. I let this sink in, and watch the travmage as they wait patiently for me to process all this information. \n        What passes for lunch arrives, and I jump as the silver tray is once again dropped on my lap table with a clattering thud. If it was hard to eat this food before, now it is nearly impossible. My throat is tight with the dawning knowledge that I might be an evil person. I wonder what I have done. The travmage watches me try to eat my food, but says nothing. Eventually, they begin to read their silver pad.\n        Several days go by in this fashion. The travmage is always beside me during the day. They won\u2019t answer questions about who I am. They said, when I am stronger, they will take me to watch my past self. The doctor must clear me for this trip because it will be a shock to my system, or so I am told. \n        The doctor works for the travmage community. We are presently in travmage territory, but where this is located in relation to anything else on Earth, no one knows. It is protected by a powerful invisibility spell. Only travmages and their \u201cguests'' can enter. I can\u2019t even look out the window, it is blurred as though ice covers it. Light gets in, but I can\u2019t see outside. Trying to leave would be pointless, I know from the stories how powerful they are. I\u2019m sure there is a spell that would hit me should I try and make a break for it. I stay away from the door when I pace in my room.\n        The travmage told me their name is Clio. Clio and I have spent these last weeks reading together, or sometimes playing a card game. I feel close to Clio now, and consider them my friend. I wonder if they feel the same way about me. I am afraid to ask, as they know who I am and what I have done, but this knowledge still eludes me. \n        Sadness overwhelms me at times, because I like this existence of myself over the past weeks. Learning, reading, chatting about the ideas in the additional approved books I received on my pad, with Clio. This is not fully me, and I know that. It breaks my heart.\n        Finally the doctor clears me for travel. I am strong enough to withstand what I learn about myself. Clio and I are to set out together on our odyssey to my past. Today, I will discover the truth about myself. I feel cold and nauseous. The only world I know, the world with Clio, may be torn asunder. Suddenly, staying in a hospital room does not seem so bad.\n        We walk down the stark corridor of the hospital. The clicking of our shoes upon the tiles echoes in my ears. Doctors and nurses are milling about as if we are not there. They have patients to attend to, so they don\u2019t notice us. We enter an elevator and the travmage picks a symbol that I do not recognize. They explain that it is a symbol of a large Celtic tree. We descend. When we emerge from the elevator, a travmage guard is there waiting for us. They walk us down the hall and open the door. We enter. \n        The room has two large leather chairs with a table between them, nothing else. No rugs. The lights on the ceiling are the same as everywhere in the hospital. Clio motions for me to sit. I sink into the old, very worn leather chair. If not for the circumstances, this would be the perfect chair to read in. \n        Clio speaks, \u201cWhat you are about to see will be devastating to you as you are now. We will be in a time bubble invisible to everyone. You will not be able to get out of the time bubble until we return to this room. I am going to show you the moments before you were injured, that should be enough for you to grasp the person you were.\u201d\n        With that said, Clio chants a few indecipherable words and we are encased in a warm soft bubble that is almost translucent. The only evidence that it is actually there are soft rainbow patches when the light hits it at the right angle. The world outside the bubble begins to swirl in a blur of colors. \n        Suddenly all is still. I am a bit discombobulated from the journey. I look around at the world outside our bubble. We are in a gorgeous courtyard with symmetrically paved walkways surrounded by cultivated gardens and trees.\n        Then, on one of these walkways I see myself surrounded by stressed and fearful ministers. As they get closer I hear their conversation.\n        Past me screams, \u201cI don\u2019t care if they starve or freeze. If they can\u2019t pay the taxes due to me then take anything they have of value, even if it is their plow. They can use their hands to harvest for all I care. That should teach them to pay what is owed. If there is nothing of value, throw one of the family members into the dungeon for a few weeks. Then the rest of the family can come and do manual labor in the castle to earn the release of their kin.\u201d \n        The minister hesitantly replies \u201cBut, your gloriousness, our dearest leader on high, the entire town has fallen on hard times because of the floods. The dungeons will be full. There will be famine throughout the village. People are going to starve to death if we take the usual amount of food for taxes. Most don\u2019t even have that.\u201d\n        Past me snaps, \u201cPerhaps you would like to join them in the dungeon since you care so much about them!\u201d \n        At that moment a rock from the guard wall falls. The minister pushes me out of the way, but the rock still hits the side of my head, knocking me unconscious. The minister calls for help. At that moment, Clio comes and takes me away. In my place she leaves a rune with a Celtic tree on it, the symbol of the travmage. The minister picks it up and understands they must wait to see what will happen. I hope this means he delays taking the food, since I am not there.\n        The world swirls around us once more and we are back in the room with the leather chairs. I fall to the ground sobbing. Memories flood back to me. The amnesia is washed away with knowledge of myself that I would rather not know. The rock should have killed me, I deserved it. My minister saved me. Why would they do that when I was so cruel?\n        After a long while, Clio rubs my shoulder and helps me to my feet. They hold me as we walk to the chair, and I sit down. There is a knock on the door, and a person with a tea cart enters. They place a tray upon the table between the two chairs and leave. Clio pours a cup of tea and hands it to me. I take a sip and warmth enters my body. I begin to relax. This tea clearly has some magical herbs in it. I thank Clio for this kindness.\n        Clio waits for me to finish the cup of tea before they speak. \n        They tell me, \u201cYou can return alone to the moment before I transported you to the hospital and live out your life as you would have before you met me, or I will transport you back there in the present moment, and you will remember what you have learned. The minister will retain his knowledge that you were with me. I left a rune behind for them, which all people know means that a travmage has taken the missing person and they will be safely returned.\u201d\n        She pauses so I can process what she is telling me. \n        Clio then continues, \u201cThe villagers know you as your past self, so you will have to work to earn their trust and respect. If you choose the latter path, the way of change, it will be hard, but you will have the blessings of the travmage. It will help you assist the village in recovering from the floods and famine, but the catch is you must become a benevolent ruler. If you return to your cruel ways, the spell of benevolence will change and dark days will befall your lands and all will know it is because of you. You will be cursed to a lonely and wretched life in your castle. The choice is yours.\u201d\n        I could not find my voice at first to reply. The guilt over the pain and suffering I caused the villagers, my minister, washes over me like sheets of icy water. Is redemption possible for me? If I spend the rest of my life working to right the wrongs of my past will it be enough? \u201cEnough for what?\u201d I wonder. The starkness of the situation hits me. If I choose the second path, I must live with the knowledge of my evil deeds. They will always haunt me, I know this. The first path is easier, returning to who I was with no knowledge that any of this has happened means that I will continue to live a life without regret. \n        Regret is the life I choose, because I can\u2019t return to evil. The person I am now is already different from my past self, thanks to the time spent with Clio, our conversations, the books they gave me to read. I will work each day to make the life of the villagers better, to help them prosper, and to try to make up for the pain that I caused them.\n        I tell Clio my decision and they are happy with my choice. The bubble swirls around us again and we are in my office that overlooks the courtyard of mishap. My minister is at my desk going through some papers and making notes. The bubble breaks and my minister looks up at us completely surprised. \n        \u201cHello,\u201d I say and then cough awkwardly. Clio takes over the situation. She explains my choice to the minister. I am nervous about their response, and completely ashamed of my past self.\n        The minister suddenly states, \u201cIt will be my pleasure to help you on this path, my dear glorious leader. I did not collect the taxes as you instructed, because when I saw the rune, I knew the travmages were at work. So, I just let things rest. No one else knows that you have been gone. Since taxes were not collected, the villagers have some food. Not enough to get through the winter, but some for now.\u201d\n        \u201cWe have to make many changes,\u201d I say to my minister. \u201cThe first is you will no longer call me glorious leader, but instead call me by name, Silverton. I value your wisdom and compassion. I don\u2019t have the words to convey how deeply sorry I\u2019m for the way that I treated you, especially when you were trying to help the villagers. I know I can\u2019t ever fully erase what I have done, but I want to work to make a better future for all of us. From now on we rule from a place of compassion. Our goal is that everyone in the castle and the village flourish.\u201d\n        The minister wipes tears from their eyes. They walk over to me and whisper, \u201cI forgive you.\u201d I begin to cry, and feel them wrap their arms around me. A new bond starts to form between us. After a few moments, we take a step back and look toward Clio. The minister pulls the rune from their pocket and hands it to them.\n        Clio says, \u201cKeep it to remember what you have learned, and know that I will always be watching over you both.\u201d With that, they disappear into the bubble.

Keep the story under 800 words.","targets":"        Wind whistles and rattles through holes in the ancient diner\u2019s windows as Reggie crawls underneath a table roughly three times his age. A fossilized piece of gum sticks to the bottom, which might have value as an archeological discovery, but does nothing to help his investigation. Brushing what feels like another layer of clothing\u2019s worth of dust off of his jacket, Reggie rises and looks around the rotten diner.\n        The nostalgic 1920s aesthetic has not survived the century-long trip to the 2020s. The plush seats have become little more than piles of rotten wood, the stools are accompanied by the stool of wild animals, and the back of the house no longer serves any drink other than pools of stagnant water. All of this wonderful ambiance is illuminated by a lantern Reggie hung from the ceiling and by Reggie\u2019s handheld flashlight. The likelihood of finding the body was all but impossible. That is, assuming the body even existed in the first place.\n        \u201cThis is what I get for listening to anonymous tips,\u201d Reggie says. \n        To be fair, it was more complicated than that. Reggie had received a yellowed old letter in his office mailbox a few days ago. Inside was an offer of substantial money if Reggie could find a body buried at the old run down 1920s diner in the middle of nowhere. After some travel expenses and entirely too much driving, he arrived at the ghost town that hosted the hollowed out eatery. Naturally, because nothing can be easy in life, a storm had kicked up as Reggie approached the cramped building. \n        \u201cAn entire day spent tossing this place and still absolutely nothing. Ah well, desperate times call for rash decision-making, or however that saying goes,\u201d Reggie says.\n        Reggie rushes to his car and back, receiving only a minor drenching for his troubles. He returns with a backpack in hand, the contents inside shielded from the rain. The ritual is a familiar companion to his own brand of detective work. Reggie has always been able to see things other people can\u2019t. But adulthood dulled this sense, so now to evoke what he used to simply experienced as a child, he needs help. \n        Reggie pulls a pair of wireless headphones out of the pack and slips them on. The noise of the storm vanishes, although he can still feel the wet wind whipping around him. After taking a deep breath, he sits in the center of the diner\u2019s floor with his legs crossed. Reggie reaches up and presses a button on the headphones, causing gentle music to play. Slowly, Reggie\u2019s mind stills. Into that stillness he speaks. \n        \u201cMay the spirits of this place make themselves known to me. If you are there, I humbly request that you appear and speak. I seek the body of a person who was stored here after death. If you know of this corpse, please reveal yourselves.\u201d\n        The wind dies. Stillness smothers the diner like an inverse thunderclap. Reggie slowly opens his eyes. Hovering before him is someone that should not be there. It is himself, but wrong. The face, build, and demeanor is the same, but the figure is translucent, like it is made of glass. Its clothing is wrong as well. The spirit is wearing a smart suit and cap. It is eerily appropriate for its surroundings. \n        Reggie stares directly at the spirit, a drop of sweat stealthy drips from his rain-soaked brow. \n        \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n        The spirit tilts its head to the side. His voice does not echo through the room, but instead emerges through a static-laced delay from Reggie\u2019s headphones. \n        \u201cReginald.\u201d \n        Reggie stands up and backs away from the spirit. \n        \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n        The lights flicker. In that instant of darkness, Reginald has floated directly in front of Reggie. \n        \u201cI am the one who sent you the letter. When I passed, I left specific instructions to have my descendant receive my letter at this time. I knew that I would be killed soon after sending it, and assumed that a hundred years would be long enough for my pursuers to lose any interest in interfering with the collection of my body. Now if I can just remember where they stuffed it\u2026\u201d \n        Reginald begins floating around the diner, putting his head through solid objects.\n        \u201cSo, wait. Am I still getting paid for this?\u201d Reggie says.\n        Reginald stops, his head poking entirely through the counter. \n        \u201c... No. They took all of my money when they killed me.\u201d\n        Reggie was already out the door at the word \u201cno.\u201d\n"}

She turned toward the oncoming car and stuck out her thumb. \n       Eric shook his head and did a double take. He knew the rule to never pick up a hitchhiker, Nonetheless, he always passed hitchhikers on the road and thought how different his day might be if one day he gave one a ride. This lady seemed harmless enough, and he was dying to know why she was doing this. He couldn\u2019t leave a helpless old lady on the side of the road. Besides, it would be a great story to tell at the Thanksgiving table. He pressed the brakes, pulled up next to the lady, and rolled down the passenger window.\n        \u201cWhere ya headed?\u201d Eric asked.\n        The lady shuffled closer to the window and shoved her hands in her pink coat pocket. \u201cOh! Thank you so much! It\u2019s starting to get chilly out here. I\u2019m headed to Chesterfield.\u201d                 \n        \u201cGreat! I\u2019m passing through there. Hop in!\u201d Eric said.\n        The lady gathered her purse and pie holder from the ground. He felt the slightest twinge of guilt that he didn\u2019t get out to help her. She set her belongings on the floorboard and got in. \n       She extended her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Doris.\u201d\n       \u201cI\u2019m Eric. Nice to meet you.\u201d He shook her hand. \u201cSo, what\u2019s a sweet lady like you doing hitchhiking?\u201d\n       \u201cWell, my car broke down, and I had to find a way to get to my daughter\u2019s house. Ya know, you can\u2019t have Thanksgiving without my special chocolate pie.\u201d She tapped the handle of the carrier. \n       \u201cWhat makes it so special?\u201d Eric asked.\n       \u201cOh, it\u2019s made with a special ingredient, but I can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s a secret.\u201d She pressed her index finger to her lips. \u201cShh!\u201d\n       \u201cI bet it\u2019s love,\u201d Eric said jokingly.\n       \u201cSomething like that.\u201d Doris smiled.\n       Eric and Doris set forth on their two-hour journey. She told him about her brilliant and beautiful grandchildren, her love of Elvis, and her orange cat, Snickerdoodle, who liked to sleep on her heating pad. Eric shared that he had just started a new job teaching high school history and that he was going to propose to his girlfriend soon. They chatted and laughed. Eric enjoyed the company, and he was glad he stopped to help. \n       Eric pulled into Bernee\u2019s convenience store to fill up with gas. Doris got out of the car. \u201cDo you want anything, dear?\u201d she asked.\n       \u201cA soda would be great. Here, let me get you some cash,\u201d he said, reaching in his pocket. \n       \u201cNo, no. Put that away. It\u2019s my treat,\u201d she said.\n       \u201cI can\u2019t let-\u201d Eric started.\n       \u201cJust say thank you and let me get this,\u201d she said sternly.\n       Eric felt uneasy, like he was being scolded. \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d\n       \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Doris softened and shuffled into the Bernee\u2019s.\n       Eric filled up and pulled into a parking space by the building so that Doris wouldn\u2019t have to walk so far. She walked out with two large fountain drinks and some scratch off lottery tickets. She looked around confused, and Eric beeped the horn to get her attention. She turned and smiled. Doris hustled to the car. Well, as fast as an eighty-year old woman hustles. \n       Eric thanked her and took his drink. Doris fidgeted in her seat and looked around. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d he asked.\n       \u201cOh yes. Just excited to get back on the road,\u201d she said.\n       Eric shrugged and pulled back on the highway. With lottery tickets in one hand, Doris reached in her pocket with another. \u201cI know I have a coin in here somewhere.\u201d\n       She pulled something out of her pocket. \u201cPecan log.\u201d Doris offered Eric the confectionary delight. \u201cThere\u2019s some fudge in here too,\u201d \n       \u201cI can\u2019t take your candy. Those are pricey at Bernees,\u201d he said.\n       \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. It was free. You know, the ol\u2019 five-finger discount.\u201d Doris chuckled. \u201cI got the sucker behind me to pay for my lottery tickets and drinks too. I told him I left my purse in the car. It wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201d \n       \u201cOh, Doris, no! You can\u2019t go around doing that. Why didn\u2019t you just take the money I offered?\u201d Eric asked. \n       \u201cI\u2019m an old lady. Let me get my kicks where I can! Ah, here\u2019s a quarter.\u201d \n       They rode in silence down the road as Doris aggressively scratched off her lottery tickets. She\u2019d blow off the silver dust, inspect the ticket, and set it to the side. She occasionally would shout out, \u201cOh good! Two dollars!\u201d or, \u201cDarn! Just one off!\u201d Eric wondered to himself how much the poor guy at the convenience store paid for these. \n       Doris finished scratching and tucked the tickets into her purse. Eric could no longer handle the uncomfortable silence any longer. \u201cYou told me about your grandkids. What about the rest of your family?\"\n       Doris had talked so lovingly about her grandchildren, so Eric was a bit shocked by her response. She talked about how ungrateful they were and how they were just counting the days down until she wouldn\u2019t be a burden. He had inadvertently opened a floodgate of resentment and contempt. He was starting to see another side to Doris. He now regretted ignoring the advice about not picking up hitchhikers. He vowed to himself, if he ever saw another old lady by the side of the road, he would just let her freeze. Probably. Maybe. \n       \u201cYou wanna know a secret?\u201d she asked.\n       \u201cUh huh,\u201d Eric said with a little quiver in his voice.\n       \u201cMy special ingredient is laxative,\u201d she whispered. Then she let out a hearty laugh. \n       Eric laughed nervously, \u201cThat seems dangerous and probably illegal.\u201d\n       \u201cDear, you need to lighten up.\u201d She patted him on the leg. \u201cLet an old lady have some fun.\u201d\n       Eric stared straight ahead. He regretted taking a bite of that pecan roll now. Had she tampered with it? Was she one of those serial killers from one of the murder shows his girlfriend watched? He should have paid better attention. He felt queasy. Certainly he had been poisoned. \n       \u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve drank all that soda. Do you mind if we make a pit stop, dear?\u201d Doris asked.\n       Eric jumped as he was startled back to reality. \u201cWhat? Pit stop. Yeah. Of course.\u201d\n       They pulled into a mom-and-pop gas station in the next small town they were passing through. Eric followed her in because he wanted to keep an eye on her and make sure she didn\u2019t commit any crimes while she was inside. He played on his phone as he waited for Doris to take care of business. \n       She emerged from the bathroom, \u201cDo you cash lottery tickets here?\u201d she asked.\n       \u201cYes ma\u2019am. As long as it is under $100,\u201d answered the clerk.\n       \u201cOh, dear. I left my purse with my tickets in the car. Could you be a dear and unlock the door for me?\u201d Doris asked.\n       Eric was not going to fall for her tricks. No way. No how. He was not paying for her snacks. She could pay herself. \u201cHere,\u201d he said as he gave her the keys.\n       \u201cThank you, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail.\u201d\n       It wasn\u2019t until Eric heard the engine rev and the tires screech as someone peeled out of the parking lot, that he realized had made a terrible mistake. \n       \u201cI believe your grandma just stole your car,\u201d said the clerk with a smile on his face. This was big excitement in a small town.\n       Eric dialed 911 as he ran from the convenience store. \u201cI was carjacked by an old lady!\u201d he shouted. Suddenly there was a loud crashing sound. \n       In a twist of fate, it turned out Doris was a terrible driver. She had jumped the curb and crashed into a restaurant across the street. Eric ran to check on his car and Doris, who had suffered just a few scrapes and bruises. \n       When Eric saw that she was okay., he yelled, \u201cWHAT IN THE WORLD IS WRONG WITH YOU?\u201d \n       Restaurant patrons gathered and clutched their pearls. They couldn\u2019t believe someone would talk to his grandmother that way. \n       A couple of men helped Doris up. \n       \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just let an old lady have some fun?\u201d she cried.\n       The police arrived and took statements. Doris put on quite the show, acting confused and unsure of where she was. They decided to take her to the hospital for good measure. As they loaded her up in the ambulance, a police officer ran to her carrying her purse and her pie. \n       \u201cHere you go, ma\u2019am. You don\u2019t want to forget this. It smells delicious.\u201d the officer said.\n       \u201cThat\u2019s my special chocolate pie. I guess I won\u2019t get a chance to share it now,\u201d she said sadly. \n       \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Hate to let a pie go to waste,\u201d  he said. \n       \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this to the station and share?\u201d Doris said.\n       \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do!\u201d the officer replied.\n       A big grin spread across Doris\u2019 face. She caught Eric staring at her in disgust.\n       She winked at him as they shut the ambulance doors. "}

She\u2019s the one who makes her own fuel from the leftover restaurant oil. Remember?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cIs she in a weird cult or something?\u201d Ash asked.\n        \u201cWe are all in weird cults, whether we know it or not,\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut Natalie\u2019s great. I think you\u2019d really like her.\u201d\n        \u201cWait, why did you take a road trip with her again?\u201d Ash asked. \n        \u201cLet me think\u2026 It must have been the spring of 2013. That\u2019s when you got married, right?\u201d\n        \u201cYeah,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cI was still finishing the anthropology master\u2019s at NYU. I remember that I had to finish a huge group project right before getting ready to drive out to Milwaukee for your wedding. Right before I left, Mom asked me if I\u2019d pick up her friend Natalie in upstate New York on my way and give her a ride to Chicago.\u201d\n        \u201cWeird. That\u2019s like a fourteen-hour drive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n        \u201cIt was even longer. I thought it was a bizarre request. I mean, I\u2019d never even heard Mom mention Natalie, and that\u2019s a lot of time in a car with a random old lady I\u2019d never met. I expected it to be super awkward. But you know Mom never asked for favors. Also, technically, I was still driving Mom\u2019s car at the time, so I couldn\u2019t really say no.\u201d\n        Ash snickered at me, \u201cYou never gave her that car back. You\u2019re basically a car thief.\u201d\n        I laughed. \u201cSo Mom texted me these super specific directions to Natalie\u2019s house. I told her just to give me an address, so I could put it in the GPS, but Mom told me that Natalie didn\u2019t have an address.  I asked for Natalie\u2019s phone number, so I could coordinate with her, but Mom said she didn\u2019t have a phone! They had only communicated via letters that she sent to a P.O. box.\u201d\n        \u201cWeird!\u201d Ash said again.\n        \u201cIf you think that\u2019s weird, just wait. So, I follow these directions Mom sends me and I end up driving for, like, an hour on these little country roads in the Adirondacks. I finally found this amazing cottage. Ash, it looked like something out of a fairy tale! I remember it really clearly. It was a tiny little house painted bright canary yellow with a blue door. There were vines growing up the sides and wildflowers absolutely everywhere I looked. It was really beautiful. And, when I say she lived in the middle of nowhere, I mean, she was in the middle of nowhere! One tiny dirt path. No electrical wires. Just a house next to a pond and a sizable garden in a flowery glen in the woods. I knocked on the door and out came Natalie. She was wearing this frock kind of dress that definitely looked homemade and carrying a huge basket full of mushrooms. I can still remember the way they smelled. My car smelled like mushrooms for weeks after.\u201d\n        \u201cYou mean Mom\u2019s car,\u201d Ash snarked with a smile.\n        \u201cMom\u2019s car,\u201d I said. \u201cSo, we started driving, and I have to tell you, we ended up having the best time. She was great. She told me all about living off-the-grid. She had some wild stories. This woman didn\u2019t pay taxes. She foraged and had her own subsistence farm. Sometimes, she went weeks without talking to any other people. I think she was just excited to have an audience. Five minutes into the trip, she was already telling me about the medicinal properties of every mushroom in her basket. Apparently, she was on her way to some kind of mycology conference in Chicago.\u201d\n        \u201cWait. Like an academic conference?\u201d Ash asked.\n        \u201cI think so?\u201d I said, unsure.\n        \u201cIf she didn\u2019t even have power to her house, how could she coordinate all that?\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know. Mycologists are weird. But Natalie was surprisingly knowledgeable about data analysis. It was fascinating.\u201d\n        \u201cOnly you would want to listen to an old lady talk about mushrooms for fourteen hours,\u201d Ash lovingly rolled her eyes at me.\n        \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it was actually fun to hang with her. At one point, we stopped to get gas and I bought her a slushy. She lost her mind. She couldn\u2019t stop talking about how amazing that slushy tasted. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d consumed anything with processed sugar in like a decade. After she drank it, she was buzzing. She started singing along with the radio, even though she didn\u2019t know the words. It was hilarious.\u201d\n        \u201cSounds kind of annoying,\u201d said Ash.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but it really wasn\u2019t. It was easy. So we finally got to Chicago really late that night. I dropped her off at an apartment building near the Loyola campus up in Rogers Park, and she went off, carrying her big box of mushrooms. And that\u2019s the last time I saw her,\u201d I told my sister.\n        \u201cWait,\u201d said Ash. \u201cHow did Mom know Natalie?\u201d\n        I tried to think, but my mind drew a blank.\n        \u201cI have no idea,\u201d I told Ash.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you spent a whole day in a car with this lady and never once asked how she knew our mother?\u201d \n        \u201cWe mostly talked about mushrooms,\u201d I said sheepishly.\n        \u201cAnd you never asked Mom?\u201d Ash furrowed her brow at me.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think I did. I can\u2019t believe I never talked about Natalie with Mom. What is wrong with me?\u201d I felt a hot pressure in my chest.\n        Ash put her hand on mine. \u201cMom was always a mystery, wasn\u2019t she? There\u2019s so much about her that we don\u2019t understand.\u201d Ash\u2019s voice sounded far away.\n        \u201cLike how she was acquainted with an off-the-grid mycologist?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cMom had a whole life outside of us, and we will never know about a lot of it,\u201d Ash said, tears coming to her eyes.\n        \u201cCan I tell you something that Natalie told me about mushrooms?\u201d I asked my sister.\n        \u201cSure,\u201d she said, her voice sounding small.\n        \u201cA mushroom is just the fruit of mycelium. The mycelium is this enormous, powerful network, woven through the soil. It is everywhere, under every step we take.\u201d\n        \u201cVery poetic. What are you saying?\u201d Ash asked.\n        \u201cMom and Natalie, they were part of the same mycelium, a relational network. Some of that energy that was in Mom came from Natalie, and some of Natalie came from Mom.\u201d There were tears in my eyes now too.\n        \u201cSome of Mom is in all of us,\u201d Ash said.\n        We were both quiet for a long beat, then Ash asked, \u201cDo you think you could find it again?\u201d \n        \u201cFind what?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cThat yellow house with the blue door in the upstate woods,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Roadtrip?\u201d I asked.\n        She took my hand and said, \u201cRoadtrip.\u201d\n"}

","targets":"        I shiver in the darkness. \n        The ship moves faster than I ever could have imagined, and though there are no windows in this room, I can feel the motion under my feet. I tug on the ropes around my wrists, trying to loosen them. I am surrounded by a dozen or so other people who have also been captured. Many of them are women and children, and most of them cough and moan with illness. I am a nine-year-old boy. I am the lone survivor from my immediate family of the plague that struck my world only a few weeks ago. Rumor has it that the strangers brought the illness as a weapon to defeat my people. \n        Considering how quickly these newcomers brought our civilization to its knees, I am inclined to believe this rumor. \n        The story of how I got here is brief but dramatic.\n        The strangers arrived in the capital city two weeks ago to much fanfare. Word had spread that they had traveled to our civilization on large vessels that carried many of them at once. They rode down the streets of the city on what looked like large, muscular deer. Apparently, these servant creatures were common in their world.\n        The strangers had similarities to us, but also differences. Their bodies were smaller than ours for the most part, but they had a head, arms, and legs. The real difference was in their coloration. Their hair had a variety of tones and textures, and their skin was much lighter than ours. A few fools on the street whispered as they marched to the palace that they must be celestial beings. But I did not believe this rumor. And once the fighting in the capital started, we all saw that they bled and died the same as us.\n        The strangers became invaders one week ago. After enjoying the hospitality of our government for a week, fighting broke out near the palace between some of the strangers and the palace guards. By this time, the mysterious plague had already spread rapidly throughout the city. My family lived only a few blocks away from the palace, but I did not witness the fighting as I was caring for my dying parents. My little sister and brother had gotten sick first, their little bodies covered in terrible sores. They became sweaty and feverish. None of our medicines helped them and they died quickly. My parents soon followed. I was the only one left. I still do not know why the sickness spared me. \n        It was the same story across the city. For every ten citizens, nine would die from the plague. The remainder did the best they could to fight off the strange invaders, but my people were betrayed by our former allies and neighbors to the south. Our neighbors had always been jealous of our power and wealth in the capital, and they chose to side with the newcomers. But they would die in the same numbers from the mysterious plague as my people did. Strangely, the newcomers were unaffected by the plague, which aided them immensely as they pillaged my beloved city of all its gold and valuables. \n        Three days ago, I was walking through the abandoned market, looking for any scraps of food I could find. I saw a few wild dogs fighting over the corpse of an old woman. She had been killed while making tortillas on the large hot stone in her market stall. I also saw one of the strange deer wandering through the main street. It had a leather blanket on its back but no rider. I considered trying to jump on its back, as I had seen the newcomers do, but feared that it would hurt me. \n        Just as I was gathering some fruit from a peddler\u2019s deserted cart, one of the invaders came up behind me. He yelled something in his language, and when I turned around, he held his weapon to my head. These devices were large sticks that made thunder that punched holes into the bodies of those unfortunate enough to be attacked by them. I dropped my fruit, and the invader tied my hands behind my back with rope. The invader put me on the back of the giant deer and took me through the city streets.\n        We encountered very few people along the way, and most of those were wounded or dying of the plague. The temples were burning as the invaders threw the priests onto the streets and stabbed them with shiny weapons. The botanical gardens that my mother had loved to visit were also on fire. Bodies floated in the canal system that ran through the city as a transportation network. The smell of death surrounded me. I closed my eyes and prayed for mercy from the gods.\n        We traveled overnight and arrived at the motherships the following afternoon. There were three of these ships a few hours' journey from the city, and when we arrived, my captor threw me into the belly of the ship.\n        I am now here with these other citizens of a once great world that is now in shambles. I notice one of the captives gesturing toward me. He does not look like my people, but he does not look like the invaders either. He is dressed similarly to the invaders, but his skin is dark like obsidian. His hair is short and very curly, and he looks to be around my age.\n        He points at his chest and says, \u201cZayd.\u201d\n        I assume he is telling me his name, and I reply with mine, \u201cTenoch.\u201d\n        Zayd points at my hands and then moves his own hands in a twisting motion. I see that his ropes are loosening, and I do the same. Soon we have both removed our bindings. I move to untie the others, but Zayd shakes his head. I see that the others are too sick to move, and though I feel a tinge of guilt, I know he is right. Two small boys cannot hope to save them all. I follow Zayd up a ladder and out of the ship.\n        Zayd takes me to a smaller ship. Unlike the motherships, it seems to only be built for a few people. Zayd points at a seat in the little ship, and I hide underneath it. I cannot see what is happening. I can feel the motion of the ship as Zayd lowers it into the darkness. He then gets under the seat opposite me. We stare at each other for a few minutes before drifting off to sleep with the motion of our tiny vessel.\n        We wake with a start. Our ship has run aground on a beach. The sun is just coming up over the horizon. The trees and grasses along the beach are familiar to me. We cannot be far from home. I step out of our ship and motion for Zayd to follow me. If we can reach the river in the jungle, we can set up a fire and pray that some of my people will find us.\n        We trudge through the dense jungle, stepping over underbrush and carefully watching out for thorny vines. Zayd seems unsure of himself in this setting, but I stop for him often, showing him which fruit is safe to eat and which he should avoid. By nightfall, we reach the river, and I find a flint rock to make us a small fire. Then we wait.\n        Within a few hours, a dozen warriors, male and female, show up. I am elated to see my cousin Meztil run out of the crowd. She embraces me, and I begin to cry, feeling safe for the first time in a while. She asks immediately where my parents and siblings are.\n        I can only shake my head. \n        I look over at Zayd. He is terrified. The warriors have surrounded him with their macuahuitls and atlatls in hand. I rush to Zayd\u2019s side, telling the warriors that he saved me. Zayd begins to speak in the language of the invaders, and my cousin shouts out for the prisoner. A young man is pulled to the front. He looks like a member of the neighboring province who betrayed us to the newcomers. My cousin tells me that the prisoner knows some of their language and should be able to translate for us so that we may learn more about this unusual stranger. With a prodding in his back from a warrior\u2019s atlatl, the translator speaks to Zayd and Zayd begins to speak at great length as the translator tells us his tale.\n        \u201cI do not come from the same world as the invaders, but a different world altogether. My people are from the Kingdom of Kangaba in the great empire of Mali. The invaders call it Africa. They come from a place called Spain. They have one god, and he tells them to conquer at any cost all that they find. I was enslaved to one of these conquerors by the name of Cortez. Cortez brought me here to your land to serve his men as they pillage your people\u2019s civilization. I think it must be too far for me to reach my mother and father across the great waters. It took months to traverse the seas before reaching your land. But if you will let me, I will live here with you. I only ask that you let me live free, not in bondage.\u201d A tear tracked down Zayd\u2019s cheek, and he looked far younger than his years at that moment.\n        My cousin Meztil stepped forward and took Zayd\u2019s hand. She said, \u201cIn our culture, when we lose someone, the gods often bring us a new person to fill the immense void left in our lives. I think the gods sent you to us today to do just that.\u201d \n        As the translator told Zayd these words, his face beamed with a smile. Meztil used her other hand to grab mine, and we began our walk back to her village, a strange, new family in a world that also felt strange and new.\n\n"}

Humanity had invented the airport terminal three centuries or more ago, but even with the shift to interstellar travel and how space stations replaced airport terminals, some things stayed the same. Like the confusing layout, maps that were worse than useless, little shops full of goods and food of dubious quality, and the limited time you had to find your gate for the connecting flight.\n        The boarding lounge described itself as serving \u201cUnaligned Passenger Carriers,\u201d and Kacey could believe it. Gal\u00e1pagos Station had clearly not invested time or money into updating the decor of the lounge since the space station came online about three decades ago. Kacey figured she could message some of her colleagues at the university and get some anthropology grad students a bit of extra credit research. At least the network terminals were fully modern.\n        Her data assistant spoke in a smooth, even voice. \u201cProfessor Ellis, your ship is called Starfall Wanderer, is accessed through Gate Three, and the boarding assistant reports that the ship is waiting for one other passenger.\u201d\n        Kacey glanced over at Gate Three, which was glowing red in a very human-based \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d kind of way. \u201cStarfall Wanderer? That\u2019s not a name I\u2019d expect from a passenger ship.\u201d Kacey knew she was used to the larger commercial carriers, whose names were almost always utilitarian and forgettable. Which meant that this was probably a privately-held ship. Which meant who-knew-what for things like comfort or safety.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re boarding the Starfall Wanderer too?\u201d asked an unfamiliar voice. Kacey turned to see someone dressed in what her parents would have called \u201cgenderless professor chic\u201d: a loose tunic, straight-leg pants, and low boots. The clothes were all in a faded teal-green blend, and the person\u2019s short hair was clearly colored to match.\n        Kacey was amused to note that her outfit was rather similar to the new person\u2019s, except she\u2019d set her hair and clothing to a warm terracotta shade.\n        \u201cDoctor Kacey Ellis, she\/her, xenoarchaeologist currently on sabbatical from Camstead University, Mars.\u201d\n        \u201cDoctor Quinn Astrid, they\/them, xenolinguist and not currently associated with any university.\u201d Quinn extended a hand, and the two briefly touched palms before initiating a connection between their data assistants.\n        Kacey\u2019s vision now included some very basic biographical data about her fellow passenger, enough to allow her to make polite conversation. After half a second, her assistant highlighted one piece of shared experience.\n        She asked, \u201cSo you had Professor Hawthorne in your grad program at Oxford?\u201d\n        Quinn smiled lopsidedly. \u201cTwo semesters,\u201d they answered, \u201cand I\u2019d have sworn the man forgot me just as soon as I walked out of the room.\u201d They nodded toward Gate Three, which seemed to be in power-saving mode. \u201cDid you get a job offer from him too?\u201d\n        \u201cThree days ago, delivered in hard copy by a private courier, including a paid trip to some destination he wouldn\u2019t name, for a job he only vaguely described but paid for half up front,\u201d Kacey sighed. \u201cThe last I\u2019d heard, he\u2019d been looking into the Harathan civilization, but Brightsun Corporation took over all the sites and locked out anyone who wasn\u2019t on their payroll.\u201d\n        Quinn nodded, and gestured vaguely outward. \u201cI heard a rumor after that. Something about Hawthorne finding evidence of an even older space faring civilization.\u201d They looked over at the gate, and frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re both here, our data assistants have pinged the boarding assistant. Shouldn\u2019t we be starting our onboarding?\u201d\n        A woman with braided green hair, dressed in a gray-brown pilot's suit, came around the corner of the corridor leading from Gate Three, waved, and called, \u201cSorry about that! My AI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d both be here this quickly, so I was having lunch. I\u2019m Captain Hall, and you should be Doctors Kacey Ellis and Quinn Astrid, right?\u201d At their nods, she continued, \u201cI\u2019ll get you onboarded and confirm everything is ready to go before we launch.\u201d She went to the terminal at the gate and started tapping away.\n        As she moved away, Kacey glanced at Quinn.\n        They looked back, and shook their head. \u201cNo,\u201d Quinn muttered just loud enough for Kacey to hear, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on either.\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019re probably both wondering what\u2019s going on,\u201d Captain Hall called. \u201cYou\u2019re right to wonder. Hawthorne\u2019s a secretive man, especially after the Brightsun debacle. My contract says I can\u2019t tell you anything more than the offer letters until you\u2019re on my ship. So I have to apologize for the lack of available information.\u201d The gate finally shifted from red to green, and Hall chuckled. \u201cBut your luggage and gear are already stowed, the Wanderer\u2019s been refueled, and we\u2019re good to go when you are. I promise to be more forthcoming once we\u2019ve made the jump to warp.\u201d\n        The Wanderer turned out to be some kind of mid-sized cargo vessel refitted to be one of the most comfortable passenger ships Kacey had ever seen. Five personal cabins, three added cabins for groups, three private bathrooms, a common area, and a kitchen. And those were just the areas for the passengers.\n        Quinn turned around, looking at the very comfortably furnished common area, and said slowly, \u201cYou have a kitchen. Here, in space, in the twenty-third century.\u201d They pointed toward a set-off area that clearly had a cooking surface, cold-box, and counter space.\n        \u201cEverything\u2019s space-proofed: the pots and pans have self-sealing lids, the cooking surface holds cookware in place even if we have a gravity failure, and even the counters have smart matter adhesive patches,\u201d Captain Hall responded. \u201cI\u2019ve carried vegans, omnivores, people with food allergies \u2013 yes, I know, even in this day and age \u2013 and nobody likes those meal brick things. I like cooking, always have, and I don\u2019t see why my passengers shouldn\u2019t benefit. Either of you have restrictions or allergies I should be aware of?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019ve got a compensator, but my system just doesn\u2019t handle cow-based dairy very well,\u201d Kacey said sheepishly.\n        \u201cI\u2019m basically an omnivore, but even with an adapted system, wheat-based products can sometimes cause issues,\u201d Quinn added.\n        \u201cGot it, I\u2019ll keep those things off-menu then.\u201d Captain Hall grinned. \u201cI\u2019m up to the pilot\u2019s cabin, I\u2019ll be plugged into the ship for the next bit, then come back and tell you what\u2019s going on.\u201d She left the two alone, and Kacey shook her head.\n        \u201cWhere did Hawthorne get this kind of money?\u201d\n        Quinn stared off into space briefly, clearly consulting their assistant. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d they answered. \u201cI mean, unless Brightsun paid him off to keep quiet about whatever they found at the Harathan digs?\u201d\n        Kacey shrugged awkwardly. Academics, regardless of their university, were paid decently well, but not enough to fund private expeditions. She\u2019d taken a sabbatical for this opportunity because Hawthorne\u2019s payment covered all her necessities for a full year. \n        Captain Hall\u2019s voice came over the speakers. \u201cI\u2019d suggest getting comfortable. Inertial stabilizers are online. We\u2019re about to leave Gal\u00e1pagos Station, but physics is still physics, and the jump to warp won\u2019t be completely comfortable.\u201d\n        At that, the two passengers sat across from each other. Quinn squeaked a bit, then grinned. \u201cThese are actual fabric chairs? With padding and everything?\u201d\n        Captain Hall\u2019s disembodied voice chuckled. \u201cI like creature comforts. Smart matter just can\u2019t seem to get that right, and I\u2019ve tried. Brace, we\u2019re undocking in three, two, one.\u201d Kacey would have had no idea they were even moving, and even the jump from normal space to warp-space was smoother than she\u2019d experienced except for her one experience with a massive commercial passenger spaceship. \n        About fifteen minutes later, Hall came into the common area, her hair a bit mussed from the pilot\u2019s chair. \u201cOkay, briefing time. First, you two aren\u2019t the only ones Hawthorne invited, and you\u2019re not the first I\u2019ve been carrying. Second, if you listen to the briefing, and one or the other of you decides you\u2019re not interested, I can turn this ship around and have you back at Gal\u00e1pagos with no issue. Hawthorne wants to ensure you can consent from an informed perspective. The only thing is, you\u2019d have to be discreet about what you\u2019re going to hear. Good so far?\u201d When the other two signaled agreement, Hall called out, \u201cOkay, system, play briefing.\u201d\n        A hologram of Professor Hawthorne popped into view in the center of the room. He was about how Kacey remembered him: bald, blue-eyed, and a well-trimmed white beard. \n        The image of Hawthorne smiled lopsidedly, and started, \u201cI know you\u2019re curious as to what I\u2019m doing, why all the secrecy. Well, I\u2019m keeping things secret because Brightsun kicked me off my own dig, paid me handsomely, and made me sign a contract about any future Harathan discoveries.\u201d\n        He winked. \u201cJoke\u2019s on them, though. The Harathans weren\u2019t the only ones in that region of space.\u201d Captain Hall tapped a button, and the hologram paused.\n        Kacey felt the surprise on her face, and saw it on Quinn\u2019s as well. Living species, like humans, were few and far between. Most civilizations they encountered were dead at this point; humans had missed encountering them while they were still active by a few centuries or several millennia. But that area of the Milky Way galaxy had been thoroughly explored, and nobody had any clue there had been any others beyond the Harathans.\n        Captain Hall started the hologram message. Hawthorne continued, \u201cBrightsun\u2019s pet xenolinguists will figure that out, but it\u2019ll take them a few years. And since what I\u2019m working on isn\u2019t actually part of the Harathan civilization, my contract doesn\u2019t cover it.\n        \u201cI\u2019m recruiting the best and the brightest from my years of teaching,\u201d Hawthorne continued. \u201cI want those of you watching this to get in on the ground floor, to use a horribly outdated term, for something I think will change how humanity views everything.\n        \u201cUntil we can find their name for themselves, I\u2019m calling them Aleph, after the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet. This world you\u2019re going to, it\u2019s not their homeworld, but what appears to be a colony world at what I suspect is the edge of the Aleph\u2019s civilization. I can\u2019t be sure how big the civilization was, and I\u2019m hoping I can get those answers before Brightsun figures things out.\u201d\n        Captain Hall paused the hologram again, and Kacey found herself looking at Quinn with wide eyes. A completely new civilization, capable of space travel and colonization, and she was being invited to help?\n        Quinn laughed a bit. \u201cI guess he really does know me. I don\u2019t want to turn this down.\u201d\n        Kacey nodded in agreement. \u201cHe probably meant his students who would drop everything for the chance to work on something like this.\u201d\n        Hall shrugged. \u201cHe was very particular, actually. \u2018Ethics, excellence, and experience\u2019 was how he described it to me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI took him to the system the first time, when he had no idea what he\u2019d find. I\u2019ve been ferrying people and supplies back and forth for a while now. There\u2019s one last bit of his message.\u201d Hall tapped a button, and the hologram resumed.\n        Hawthorne said, \u201cAn expedition like this isn\u2019t cheap. I have a sponsor this time, though, someone who\u2019s as interested in pure exploration without exploitation as I am. As I hope you are. She\u2019s from an old, old Earth family, more money than she honestly knows what to do with. And she\u2019s your pilot. Captain Hall has no love for Brightsun, or really any of the corporations, and believes in the work we\u2019re doing here in the Lixos system. Named, I hope you recall, for one of the farthest flung colonies of the ancient Phoenicians. But I digress. I hope you want to be part of this, but I understand if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a commitment, but I think it\u2019s worthwhile. I hope to see you here.\u201d With that, the image of Hawthorne blipped out of existence, and Captain Hall bounced a bit in her seat.\n        \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve heard the pitch, you know what\u2019s at stake, and you know how much I\u2019m involved. This is where you tell me officially whether you\u2019re in or not.\u201d\n        Quinn immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m in. I have nothing waiting for me back home.\u201d\n        Kacey grinned and added, \u201cI\u2019m in too.\u201d"}

They do not meet until they are at the airport terminal about to board their plane to Paris. Describe the places they visit, what they do, and how their relationship develops. The genre is romantic comedy. Write the story from the first-person perspective. The tone is light-hearted, and the ending is happy. Word count should be between 2550 and 2650 words. ","targets":"        Be careful what you wish for, because it might come true. Well isn\u2019t that the truth! I\u2019ve been wishing on a star for years that I would finally get to write the travel destination piece for the wellness magazine I work for, The PineLodge Magazine. It finally happens, but with a catch. The editors decide a couples\u2019 perspective will be the new angle of the monthly article. It is going to be a he said\/she said piece. The reason behind this decision: a major donor is sponsoring all costs associated with the article, and they have insisted on this dynamic. \n        Congratulations to me! My promotion comes with a partner. Ugh!\n        Clive. Clive is the name of my partner. We\u2019re to travel together as if we\u2019re a couple. They mean business at The PineLodge Magazine. We\u2019re to pretend we are engaged, so we can write about all the things a couple might do or experience on the trip, including sharing a room. They want us to be able to comment on how the hotel staff treats couples during their stay. I\u2019m told that every room has a pullout sleeper sofa, so I guess we will be flipping coins for who gets to sleep on that bed of comfort. Oh, joy! \n        By the way, they just hired him without any input from me. He is an experienced travel writer, which is the reason they picked him. They gave me no explanation as to why I wasn\u2019t informed about a partner in advance of the change, which annoys me. However, this is my dream position, and I\u2019m totally willing to fake an engagement to go to Paris. The magazine even bought me a beautiful fake diamond solitaire engagement ring. I actually like the fake little thing, very sparkly. A great big thanks to the donor!\n        There is one little snafu in our plans. I was supposed to meet Clive last week, and we were supposed to spend five days getting to know each other in our home town. The paper Clive is leaving is only a few miles away from the magazine. So at least we have our home area as something in common. The magazine planned activities for us to do together, and made sure we both received our corporate cards a few weeks ago to cover expenses.  Alas, his last assignment was in an area that had a massive tropical storm, and so his flight was delayed several days. In fact, he is literally spending the night at the airport hotel and then meeting me at the terminal in the afternoon for our flight.                                                           The flight is nine hours long. I hope I don\u2019t hate him. I wish I had thought to ask my doctor for a sedative.\n        It could be worse, I mean at least it\u2019s not an arranged marriage. I arrive at the gate. As usual, I\u2019m really early. There is a bar across from the waiting area, so I decide to go there and have a drink while waiting for him. I send him a quick text about my location, and order my drink. I open the reading app on my phone and pretend to immerse myself in a book. Look at me appearing calm, like nothing crazy is about to happen. Traveling with a complete stranger pretending to be my fianc\u00e9. Paris better be worth it. \n        Luckily the bar is not crowded, so I put my bag on the chair next to me to save Clive a seat. I\u2019m so nervous. Pretending to read is hard. However, my song comes on, floating through the air I hear Hallelujah sung by k.d. lang. My mind becomes lost in the music. I take a deep breath, and imagine the music flowing through me. I close my eyes as my hand rests up my glass. \n        Intruding upon my reverie, I hear a deep voice say, \u201cExcuse me are you Daisy?\u201d \n        I look up. He is taller than I expected. I finally manage to say, \u201cYes, and you are Clive?\u201d \n        What a genius response. Of course he is, how else would he know my name. I move my bag so he can sit down. Clive orders a drink. I\u2019m relieved that he isn\u2019t any more suave than I am at the moment. Let\u2019s just say it, this is awkward. We make a half hearted toast to our partnership, and each take a big gulp from our drinks. I can\u2019t believe how interesting the inside of my glass has become. The bartender asks if we want another round, Clive enthusiastically says yes, and I agree. \n        Over the loudspeaker we hear that our plane will start boarding shortly. Clive pays for the drinks. I mean, technically, the paper pays for our drinks and all expenses for the trip. We both have a corporate card. We leave the bar and head over to the gate. Our rows are called and we board.  As we approach our seats, we realize that we have to determine who sits by the window. Thankfully, Clive tells me I can have that seat. I\u2019m grateful. \n        The plane ride is, luckily, uneventful, and we check into our hotel without any issues. We then decide that our first order of business must be to get food. We are starving, and our sense time is off. Jet lag, the struggle is real. After all, Paris is a long way from Delaware, our home. Neither of us speak French, but we are willing to mime for food at this point.\n        Luckily, eating does not come down to our miming skills. After walking a few blocks we come to a restaurant with outdoor seating. The tables are small and wooden. Each has a white cloth over it with a glass vase holding a single rose. We are shown to our seats. As we sit down, I realize that mine wobbles slightly on the cobblestone. The colored leaves sprinkled upon the ground crunch under my feet as I adjust my chair.\n        Our waiter, Antoine, speaks a bit of English, and has a flair for the dramatic. When he finds out we\u2019re there to celebrate our \u201cengagement,\u201d he brings us a couple glasses of champagne on the house. Yes, the city of love welcomes us imposters. I should feel ashamed of myself for the ruse earning us drinks, but I\u2019m enjoying myself too much. Antoine suggests a bottle of wine for us, and we go for it. \n        The menu is in French, but I can make out the word brie coupled with an unknown word. Whatever that is, it will be my appetizer, you can\u2019t go wrong with brie. I\u2019m actually willing to make an entire meal out of brie and bread, but I\u2019m trying to be normal since this is my first non-plane meal with my \u201cfianc\u00e9.\u201d Antoine comes back with our wine and pours it into the glasses with a flourish. He takes our order and we are alone with nothing else to do but talk to each other. Suddenly, I wish I had the menu that I can\u2019t read back in my hands. \n        \u201cSo, is this your first time in France?\u201d I hear myself saying, and then kick myself. Of course it is. The point of this little exercise is to go someplace that neither of us has ever been before. \n        Clive grins, and responds, \u201cI was about to ask you that myself, but then I had to kick myself.\u201d He begins to laugh.\n        I laugh too. Schadenfreude sets in and I am relieved beyond words that this is as awkward for him as it is for me. Misery, after all, loves company. We begin to make fun of our situation together. Before we know it, we are laughing so hard we are holding our sides. Antoine approaches with the brie looking at us as if we are demented. It makes us laugh harder.\n        After we finish our meal, we decide to spend the rest of the evening strolling the streets together. Paris is beautiful as the sinking sun casts its last glow upon the buildings and sidewalks.  Night falls and the lights of the city begin to glimmer. It\u2019s positively magical. We walk in a companionable silence enjoying the scenery of the city. No wonder writers and musicians sing the praises of this enchanting place.\n        We return to our hotel room exhausted, but happy. Once there, reality hits us like a bucket of cold water. We now have to share personal space. There is only one bathroom. I will be in my pajamas in front of a man that I have only known for hours. I mean, that is why I packed yoga pants and a baggy shirt to sleep in, but still. \n        The share a room thing turns out alright. We manage. There are a few awkward moments, like when I yell at him not to come out of the bathroom because I am pulling my sweater on. But, we make it work. The morning starts on a happy note. For breakfast we go to a little cafe and grab some coffee and croissants to eat as we walk toward the Eiffel Tower.\n        It\u2019s a gorgeous day and I\u2019m loving our walk. What a beautiful city. We try to remember to take lots of selfies so the editors can pick one or two for the article. We look pretty good together. We arrive at the Eiffel Tower and I feel nervousness kicking in. I am afraid of heights, so I\u2019m not looking forward to the journey to the top for selfies. However, we have scheduled activities that we must do for the paper and this is one of them. \n        Clive suddenly asks, \u201cHey, are you alright? You got quiet there.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m afraid of heights;\u201d I say with a resigned sigh.\n        \u201cLook, I\u2019ll be there for you. If you need to grab my arm or hand, go ahead. We will get through this. Let\u2019s just get up, get the selfie, and get down.\u201d He says.\n        I look at him gratefully. He could have made fun of me, or shrugged off my fears. So, at least it will be just a quick up and down thing. I can live through that. We finish the deed and are on solid ground again. I did end up clinging to his arm. I swear I felt the tower sway. On the bright side, our selfie looks amazing.\n        We decide to stop at a cafe for a glass of wine and some cheese. I\u2019m just taking a sip of wine when Clive looks over at me and grins, he then says \u201cI guess for our next trip, skydiving is out.\u201d We both laugh. \n        Next place on our list is the Louvre. I\u2019m so excited. My second major as an undergraduate was Art History. Mona Lisa here I come. We finally approach the picture. I\u2019m brimming with anticipation. I get my first good look at her. Oh, it's much smaller than I imagined it would be. I mean, I know the dimensions, but still. I am struggling with my minor sense of disappointment when Clive remarks, \u201cI know it\u2019s a classic work, but I think it\u2019s kinda ugly.\u201d \n        The artsy couple just beside us gasp in shared horror. They gaze upon us as if we are monsters about to destroy all that is good in the world. We look at each other and burst out laughing. We can\u2019t stop and have to make a hasty retreat from the room before the security guard decides to escort us out. Those looks we got were priceless! Now that would have made an excellent picture. Not a publishable picture, but a great memory. \n        We stop in the giftshop to take a look around. I find this gorgeous gray candle holder with a sooty etched image of the Louvre on it. I really love it. I don\u2019t love the price. Oh. My. God. Fifty-five euros for the little candle holder. It does actually come with a creamy white votive that smells like lavender, but still. It\u2019s way too much. The company doesn\u2019t pay for souvenirs, and my pay raise hasn\u2019t kicked in yet. I reluctantly put it down and bump into Clive. I tell him I am going to pick up a magnet with an image of the Louvre on it. They are only seven euros.\n        For dinner we have tickets for a dinner cruise on the Seine. I\u2019m really excited. We go back to the hotel to get changed. I do my hair and makeup, and then slip into my little black dress. I then put on my favorite black 1940\u2019s style heels, complete with a chic ankle strap. Clive is wearing a suit, but skipped the tie. \n        I notice that there is no awkwardness with us sharing the space anymore. The two of us have a growing rapport. It makes me happy since we will be traveling together monthly. Clive helps me with my jacket, and we leave the room. We just get out and he says, \u201cWait, I forgot something,\u201d and goes back in. Maybe he forgot his wallet.\n        We take a cab to the dinner boat. Once we board, we are shown to our table toward the back. It\u2019s next to the window, what luck! We have an amazing view of the city as the sun is setting. The dinner is absolutely amazing. So many delicious morsels: cheese, bread, p\u00e2t\u00e9, salad, bouillabaisse (a type of fish stew), religieuse (a decadent pastry), and of course wine. The band is magnificent. \n        As dinner ends a small dance area lights up. They begin to play Tu Vu\u00f2 F\u00e0 L'Americano, Clive grins, and asks me if I want to dance. I do, but warn him I am terrible at it. As it turns out, so is he. We laugh as we bump into each other. When the music ends we are out of breath and happy. \n        We are about to leave the dance floor and then the next song begins to play, La vie en rose. A very romantic song, from the 1940s, and it\u2019s one of my favorites. People begin to dance around us. The lights are soft and the music is flowing over us. Clive offers me his hand, and we begin to dance. It\u2019s absolutely magical. I feel like I am floating. The rest of the night passes in a blissful haze on the water beneath the sparkling stars as the buildings of Paris glitter against the dark sky.\n        The boat docks and we take a long stroll arm in arm beneath the stars on this cool autumn night. Eventually, we return to our room and get ready for bed. I begin to turn down the covers, and notice a box on my pillow. I look at Clive, and he says \u201cOpen it.\u201d My breath catches in my throat as I take the lid off. It\u2019s the candle from the Louvre. \n        \u201cThank you so much, really. I love this candle holder, and will always cherish it.\u201d I say, trying not to cry. My heart is fluttering.\n        Clive smiles, \u201cI saw how much you liked it, and I want you to have something special to remember our first trip together.\u201d\n        The rest of the journey goes by in a happy blur. We visit Notre-Dame Cathedral, work on our article in different cafes, go dancing at a club hosting a swing music night (some toes were injured), and stroll the streets of Paris arm in arm. \n        Alas, our time in Paris comes to an end all too quickly. We are both sad to leave. As I watch the ground get smaller from the window of the airplane, I feel Clive take my hand in his. I look over and we share a smile, \u201cand life will always be la vie en rose.\u201d"}

They spot each other as one wanders through the halls of affordably stocked food, but neither speak until they meet at the register. Roger, a rather tall individual in his thirties, blearily slaps a bag of chips, gum, and a drink onto the counter. Eric, a much shorter man in his early twenties, grabs and scans the items with practiced efficiency. A buzzer quietly echoes from somewhere in the backrooms. When it does, a digital display clock on the wall lights up. Without looking up from his work, Eric speaks. \n        \u201cDid you know this is the worst time to be a cashier at a gas station?\u201d\n        He says this not to Roger, but rather at him. In response, Roger blinks slowly at him.\n        \u201cHuh?\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t mean the economic impacts or sociopolitical implications of being a cashier in a nowhere gas station, I mean the hour. 4AM is an abyssal time. A moment on the clock that most are absent for. Yet here we are, living through it. No one responds to unfortunate things happening to a person at 4AM. Not for a few more hours at least.\u201d\n        Eric finishes scanning the items and passes them to Roger, who stands transfixed at the continuous drone coming out of Eric\u2019s mouth. \n        \u201cAnything can happen at such a time. I\u2019ve seen human interactions the likes of which you could never imagine. Barbarity akin to medieval slaughter. Passions that would make poets weep. Solitude so complete that it stretches onto infinity. Yet here we stand. Two people making a simple exchange of goods and services. Truly, this job never ceases to inspire me.\u201d\n        Roger finally manages to break out of the monotone incantation Eric cast on him. He twitches and grabs his things. \n        \u201cMan, I\u2019m just trying to get home in time for breakfast,\u201d Roger says.\n        \u201cAh, breakfast. For me, that is akin to dinner. Why eat a nourishing meal to start the day when the day is already coming to an end? At least for myself as an indi-\u201d\n        Before Eric\u2019s words can take hold once more, Roger turns and makes for the door. \n        \u201cWait!\u201d Eric shouts as Roger grabs the door handle. \n        Roger stops and turns back to the cashier. Eric looks nervous, almost close to panic. \n        Eric speaks. \u201cJust stay here for\u2026\u201d \n        He glances over at the clock on the wall. It appears to be counting down, not showing the actual time. \n        \u201cOne more minute!\u201d Eric finishes. \n        However, when Eric turned to check the clock, Roger opened the door. \n        Light blasts through the windows of the gas station, blinding both men inside. An immense groaning noise, as though the bones of the world were creaking, blares through the building. Everything shakes, the affordably stocked food and snacks fly off the shelves. All of this builds and builds until the light and sound is consumed by fading consciousness. \n        Sensation slowly seeps back into Roger. The first thing he becomes aware of is an acute ache in his everything. His eyes open and are mercifully met with faint light, which helps him gather more of himself instead of redoubling the ache in his head. As he examines his body to make sure everything is where it should be, he realizes he is covered in a patchy blanket of cheap chip bags. It takes him a minute to rise, but he manages it with a fair amount of grumbles. Miraculously, he actually feels more conscious than earlier. A power nap of indeterminate length combined with forced unconsciousness tends to have that effect. \n        In the commotion, Roger rolled back into the middle of one of the aisles, which cut off his line of sight to the windows. Now he stands and gets his first look at the outside world. He is greeted with the sight of a starry night sky. But something is off about it. Where once was a patch of road illuminated by a streetlight, there is now just more night sky. Roger draws closer to the doors, and as he does, he catches sight of something utterly massive. \n        A planet spins in the emptiness beyond the pavement. Some distant rational part of Roger\u2019s brain notices that it\u2019s Jupiter. The big storm spot is right there. The rest of his brain has gone blank once more. \n        A crash from deeper in the building tears Roger away from his important business of staring slack-jawed at the impossible sight before him. He turns towards the very dark and very empty store. Another clatter of something hitting the ground echoes from behind a door marked \u201cStaff Only!\u201d \n        Looking quickly around for any way to defend himself, Roger grabs a small spinning display stand. He creeps slowly towards the menacing door. The sounds of clattering only get louder and more frequent as he approaches. Roger reaches out, grabs the doorknob and gathers as much of his courage as he can, then throws the door open.\n        Now, Roger has never seen what the employee\u2019s only area of a gas station looks like. But he is fairly certain that it doesn\u2019t include an entire wall of monitors, alien consoles, and glowing holograms floating through the air. Yet, that is what confronts him when he steps into the backroom. In the middle of all this chaos, Eric runs between consoles and slaps holographic symbols around the room. Each action of his has a rippling effect across the wall of screens. Complex images scrawl across the wall until all of the screens flash red in unison. \n        \u201cOh no, no, no, no, no, no!\u201d Eric shouts. \n        \u201cWhat the heck is going on here?!\u201d Roger shouts back.\n        Eric\u2019s head snaps up. \u201cYou! The idiot who opened the door mid flux!\u201d\n        The entire building suddenly lists to the side. Eric grabs onto one of the consoles, while Roger manages to snag on the door frame by abandoning the display stand. A hologram falls past Eric, who reaches out a hand and slaps it. The symbol shatters into fragments of dispersing light, and the building slowly begins righting itself. However, the screens all remain red. \n        \u201cQuick! Before we lose stability again, you have to help me!\u201d Eric says. \n        Every instinct in Roger\u2019s body tells him to figure out what\u2019s going on, but thankfully he is able to tell when a situation is urgent. He rushes into the chaotic room of maddening lights.\n        \u201cWhat do you need?!\u201d Roger asks.\n        \u201cOkay, when you see this nodule turn red, slap it with this!\u201d Eric says as he gestures to point on the console and hands Roger an odd rod-like device. \n        Roger takes his place by the console as Eric continues sprinting around the room, slapping and finicking with seemingly everything around him. Roger can\u2019t help but be transfixed by the bizarre display, until he notices that the strange orb in the console in front of him has turned red. He gives it a nudge with the device, and all the screens flicker back to their original displays.\n        Eric slumps against the console before him. \n        \u201cOh, thank goodness. That was closer than I\u2019d like.\u201d\n        Eric looks up and sees Roger standing above him, brandishing the display stand.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re going to explain what the heck is happening right now,\u201d Roger says. \n        Eric sighs. \u201cAlright. I guess you\u2019re owed that much. I\u2019ll try to keep this brief.\u201d\n        Eric pushes the display stand aside. With a gesture from him, the displays flicker to show the gas station sitting atop a small chunk of earth. \n        \u201cBefore you ask, yes, I am human. I\u2019m a smuggler that buys interesting things from your developing colonies and delivers them to buyers in larger systems. My ship was in the process of refueling when you showed up. Normally that\u2019s fine, my ship stays camouflaged as a gas station for good reason, but when you came to cash out a flux flare hit the core. I tried to keep you distracted until the automatic compensators dealt with it, but I guess my small talk isn\u2019t as good as I thought it was. When you opened the door, the flare warped the ship all the way out here and drained the main batteries. Now we\u2019re stuck out here on backup power, and the only place that we can get power from is Earth. So, we\u2019re going to have to take the trip back the long way. Does that all make sense?\u201d\n        Roger blinks as he processes this torrent of information. Before he is able to generate a response, Eric slaps him on the back. \n        \u201cGood. Should be a smooth trip, unless something goes catastrophically wrong again like a rogue meteorite, or we get detected by Lunarian Pirates.\u201d\n        The building rocks again. \n        Roger\u2019s mind, which was already working extremely hard to pick a decent question out of the wall of new facts, seizes on the fairly easy and         expected question this situation offers. \n        \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Roger asks. \n        \u201cGiven how today has gone? I\u2019d say it\u2019s Lunarian Pirates,\u201d Eric responds."}

He was the CEO of an enormous oil company headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska. Megan had recently moved to Anchorage for the new job, and Jessica had flown in from San Francisco to visit her friend in this beautiful city.\n        Jessica hadn\u2019t packed any formal clothes. She had planned for a chill weekend of sightseeing, dive bars, and crashing on Megan\u2019s couch, so had just thrown her warmest clothes in an overnight bag. But when Megan received a last minute invitation to a dinner party at her boss\u2019s mansion, Megan said, \u201cWhen your billionaire boss asks you to go to a house party, you say yes.\u201d\n        Jessica borrowed one of Megan\u2019s little black dresses, which had looked surprisingly good on her. Megan loved dressing Jessica up. They\u2019d lived together in a tiny, one-bedroom apartment when they were in graduate school, and they\u2019d often shared clothes. Megan had always wanted a sister, and loved picking out outfits for Jessica. Megan\u2019s style was always more flashy than Jessica\u2019s, but Jessica was a good sport about letting Megan dress her up.\n        he women confidently walked into the mansion, marveling at the views from the huge floor to ceiling windows. Caterers were walking around with colorful appetizers. Megan immediately ran into a few coworkers and started chatting while Jessica made her way to the bar.\n        Jessica had just ordered a dirty gin martini when she felt a bump at her elbow.\n        \u201cGive her the goat cheese olives\u201d a handsome blonde man said to the bartender. \u201cThey are really good,\u201d he smiled at her.\n        Jessica thanked him and he cracked a joke. She was somewhat taken aback by this arrogant, tall, smiling man. When she got her drink, she took a sip and exclaimed, \u201cThat is the best martini I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d\n        \u201cI know how to order,\u201d he said.\n        Jessica returned to Megan, who was perched next to a high top table, staring at her. \u201cDo you know who that guy is?\u201d she asked. Megan explained that Jessica has been flirting with Steve Orchman, her boss\u2019s oldest son. Apparently, Steve had a reputation for being a quintessential millionaire party boy.\n        Soon, Steve joined Jessica and Megan at their table and kept returning with drinks. Later in the night, Steve brought Jessica into a private library and gave her a glass of the best whiskey she\u2019d ever tasted. She was giddy from the drinks and overwhelmed by the lavish beauty of the house. He leaned in and kissed her.\n        As the party was winding down, Steve and Jessica were still feeling flushed and flirty. He asked her if she wanted to stay the night.\n        \u201cI have to catch an early flight back to San Francisco tomorrow,\u201d she said with the slightest hint of hesitation.\n        He said, \u201cNo way! I\u2019m leaving for San Francisco tomorrow too. I can fly you back into the city.\u201d\n        \"Fly me back?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m a pilot. I have my own plane.\u201d He said this with a big, cocky smile.\n        \u201cOf course you do,\u201d she said, leaning into him for another kiss.\n        Before giving Steve an answer, Jessica checked in with Megan.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a weird feeling about getting into a plane with a stranger.\u201d\n        \u201cJess! If a handsome millionaire playboy asks you to fly into the sunset with him, you say yes,\u201d Megan said enthusiastically.\n        Megan was always trying to talk Jessica into \u201csaying yes to the moment.\u201d Jessica was usually the more conservative of the two. However, she had a few flings with some wealthy men before and was usually pretty confident in situations like these. \n        She couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint why, but Jessica felt a slight pang of anxiety as Megan was leaving with the rest of the group.\n        The rest of the night with the charming Steve Orchman was a fun and wild blur. Jessica awoke the next morning in Steve\u2019s bed with a dry mouth and a raging headache. Steve lay next to her, loudly snoring.\n        She wanted to get dressed, but only had the little black dress she borrowed from Megan. She grabbed a shirt off of Steve's floor, and put that on. Then, she heard her phone buzz in her bag. Megan had texted her a series of eggplant emojis.\n        It was already 10:00 am. She should be boarding her flight right now, and she hoped that this party boy would make good on his promise to fly her back home. She\u2019d never been on a private plane. \n        Finally, Steve groggily rolled over and saw Jessica in bed next to him. He leaned over to kiss her and then got up to use the bathroom. She noticed that he didn\u2019t bother to close the door. He came back in, looking a big ragged. He then looked at his phone and cursed. \n        \"I'm running late,\" he told her. He asked her if she still wanted a ride to San Fran. She said yes and asked him if he\u2019d drive her to her friend\u2019s place to get her bag. He told her that he didn\u2019t have time. Megan lived all the way on the opposite side of the city, and he was already late. They\u2019d have to go now.\n        Jessica was a bit shocked with his lack of consideration, but he said it in such a charming way, that it didn\u2019t really matter. She told him that she didn't have anything to wear, and he told her to hang on. He returned a minute later with women\u2019s designer leggings and a soft sweater. He said that his ex never picked up some of her stuff. Jessica found the whole moment creepy, but she was still trying to play along. The clothes were a little small for her, but she squeezed herself into them.\n        He asked her, \u201cWhat size shoe are you,\u201d and brought her into a mudroom full of coats and boots. It freaked her out a little that there were 4 or 5 different sized women\u2019s boots lying around. \n        \u201cWhy do you have so many women\u2019s shoes?\u201d she asked. \n        He shrugged it off. \u201cPeople come here on ski weekends and leave stuff all the time,\u201d he said casually.\n        She shoved Megan\u2019s dress and her heels from the night before into a tote bag, and they headed off to his plane. She texted Megan, \u201cI\u2019m leaving all of my stuff to fly off with Steve. Can you bring it back when you visit next month?\u201d \n        Megan responded with a GIF of Minnie Mouse blowing kisses from an airplane, which Jessica took as a yes.\n        They arrived at the Merrill Field Airstrip. They passed by a large row of helicopters, then stopped by a single engine, two-seater plane. She was surprised by how small it was.\n        They jumped in, and he told her to buckle up. Then, he turned on the engine, as if he were just in a car backing down his driveway.\n        \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to do a checklist or something?\u201d she asked.\n        \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I am doing.\u201d There it was again: that cocky twist in his smile.\n        The takeoff was somewhat exhilarating. He laughed at her as she gasped when the ground rapidly fell away from them. It was exciting to be so high up in such a small craft. \n        She looked out her window and took pictures of the view. They flew over the white peaks of mountains. The peaks seemed far too close, but Steve looked so relaxed. \n        He laughed at her when she said, \u201cSteve, that mountain looks so close!\u201d \n        \u201cTrust me, baby,\u201d he said and put a hand on her knee.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s a pet peeve. I don\u2019t really like being called \u2018baby\u2019.\u201d She said this in a casual tone, but Steve stiffened a little.\n        \u201cOh no?\u201d he said, with a grin. He started rubbing her knee. Another giant white slope appeared before them.\n        \u201cHey, Steve. Look ahead. Don\u2019t we need to pull up higher or something?\u201d\n        He was now moving his hand further up her leg.\n        \u201cDude! Both hands on the wheel!\u201d She said it as if making a joke, but she could feel her body start to shake. Something was wrong.\n        \u201cNervous, baby?\u201d he said. His smug voice had a new ring to it. It was less charming. Underneath his calm demeanor, she could sense a hint of threat in his voice. The hair on her arms stood up. The realization came to her so suddenly that she could hardly register it. I am in danger. Gently, she tried to push his hand off of her leg.\n        \u201cSteve. For real. Watch where you are going!\u201d\n        He tightened his grip on her leg and his hand kept moving up further to her thigh. He was fully facing her now.  With only one hand on the controls, he was looking down at her chest and away from the increasingly horrifying view of the impending slope.\n        \u201cSteve!\u201d She screamed. \u201cPull up! We are not going to make it.\u201d\n        He looked ahead, and cursed as he suddenly pulled at the control wheel, trying to gain altitude, but it was too late. \n        It all happened so fast. Jessica heard herself screaming. Steve began to scream too. She saw the white slope of the mountain growing before her. There was a loud beeping. Suddenly, tree tops appeared right outside of her window. She held onto her seat in a panic. Then, everything went black.\n        When she regained consciousness, Jessica was in more pain than she had ever felt before. There was shattered glass on her lap. She turned her head and saw Steve. He was groaning.\n        The plane had crashed into a clearing. \n        \u201cAre you OK?\u201d She asked.\n        Steve glared at her with a fury in his eyes that terrified her. He pounded his fists down on the control panel and yelled out a long string of profanities.\n        Jessica slowly began moving her body. She reached for her phone in her pocket. It was still intact and charged, but she had no service.\n        She wriggled her toes. She could move both of her legs. Reaching to unbuckle her belt, she felt a sharp pain in her right shoulder, but she could move her left arm.\n        With effort, she pulled the latch at her door. It opened, and she was able to step out of the wreckage. A gash on her forehead dripped down the side of her face and into the snow.\n        As far as she could see, mountains stretched away from her. It was breathtaking. The sheer natural beauty would have astounded her in any other circumstance, but now she was full of terror.\n        \u201cSteve! Look!\u201d She yelled. From her vantage, she could see a gray line of smoke and a mountain lake far below her. The smoke was clearly coming from a campsite near the lake.\n        \u201cCome on!\u201d she yelled back at Steve, who was also pulling himself away from the wreck of the plane. \u201cThere are people down there. Let\u2019s go get help.\u201d\n        \u201cWe are not going anywhere,\u201d the anger in his voice made her take a step back.\n        \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.\n        \u201cYou always stay near the wreck, you idiot! My dad will send a crew out for us. If we leave the plane, they won\u2019t know where to look.\u201d\n        \u201cBut, Steve, there are people right down there,\u201d Jessica said, frantically pointing down at the source of the smoke.\n        \u201cI know what I am doing,\u201d he snarled.\n        Jessica looked at him. Contempt was boiling in her chest.\n        \u201cNo, Steve. You don\u2019t.\u201d\n        She took a few steps. The pain in her shoulder was excruciating, but she could walk. Grabbing her little tote bag, she found Megan\u2019s pretty black dress and wrapped it around her face. She ripped the stockings she wore the night before with her teeth and used them to bandage her arm. Then, slowly, she began to walk away from the wreck in slow, labored steps, heading down the steep slope of the mountain towards that distant smoke.\n        \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve screamed these words out at her. \u201cWe have to wait here!\u201d\n        \u201cIf we wait here, we will freeze,\u201d Jessica said. She was surprised how calm her voice sounded.\n        Her panic had been so overwhelming that she now felt hollow.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t you dare take another step. You stay right here!\u201d Steve commanded.\n        Without another word, Jessica turned her back on him. She took a step. Then another. He continued to scream at her until she was out of earshot.\n        It took her two hours of painfully hauling herself through the frigid snow to make her way down the slope towards the smoke. Finally, she found the small campsite occupied by a group of hikers. She nearly lost consciousness by the time she was near enough to call out for help.\n        Soon, she found herself in a tent with two older women. One woman forced her to drink something warm, and another wrapped blankets around her.\n        The next day, Megan came into Jessica\u2019s hospital room with a tear stained face. Jessica squeezed her friend\u2019s hand. She had broken her shoulder and sustained some other minor injuries, but she\u2019d be ready to go home the next day.\n        Megan pulled up her phone to show Jessica a story about the crash. Steve Orchman had been found next to the wrecked plane hours after Jessica had made it to the camp. He was stable, but had lost 3 toes from frostbite.\n        \u201cSo, if a handsome millionaire playboy asks you to fly into the sunset with him, you say yes, huh?\u201d Jessica laughed at her friend\n        \u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s just trust our guts. OK?\u201d Megan said, squeezing Jessica\u2019s hand.\n        \u201cDeal,\u201d Jessica said with a smile."}

It locked the flight systems into a controlled descent mode right before the lightning hit.\u201d\n        \u201cWe\u2019ll bring its module back to base, along with our mapping data,\u201d I assured him, \u201cand hopefully they\u2019ll be able to resurrect the flight AI without too much trouble.\u201d I glanced around the interior of the small plane and exhaled. \u201cOur personal survival packs made it through intact, thankfully.\u201d\n        Markus called back, \u201cHey, Devin? Are we at a low spot in the terrain, or a high spot? It\u2019s too cloudy to be sure right now, but we don\u2019t want to risk being caught in a flash flood.\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know, and let\u2019s not risk anything. I\u2019ll pass the packs out to you, then the data drives, then the emergency supplies case.\u201d\n        A few minutes later, we were outside the plane with everything necessary we could salvage. The rain had slowed, but the dark gray cloud cover made it impossible to see all that far. My eyes had already adjusted to the gloom, but Markus at least warned me before he turned on the flashlight. \n        \u201cHunh. Not much variation in elevation that I can see,\u201d he said as he looked around. \u201cPlants look to be developing correctly, though. I\u2019m mostly seeing low ferns and short grasses.\u201d\n        I sighed. \u201cThe terraforming is working, then, even though ferns evolved about three hundred million years before grasses. No trees?\u201d\n        \u201cNo,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut I vaguely remember Doctor Robinson talking about introducing them once they and their team confirmed that the soil was deep enough to support a robust root system.\u201d\n        \u201cWhich means no landmarks. And since the scientists back at Alpha Base were waiting on all the mapping data before launching the GPS satellites, we don\u2019t have that either.\u201d I gestured for him to shine the torch at the emergency supplies case from the plane, and continued, \u201cI have some practical survival experience, but my last assignment was on a terraformed water-world.\u201d\n        He laughed. \u201cWith the rain tapering off, we\u2019re not likely to need to swim back to base.\u201d\n        \u201cHa ha,\u201d I responded with a smile. Meanwhile, I was sorting through the case. The expeditionary team for this world had planned out what supplies might be necessary in case of an emergency. The packs were for personal survival needs, while bulkier items and more general necessities were stored in the case.\n        Markus watched me as I went through the supplies. \u201cNo GPS and no landmarks. You\u2019re looking for a compass?\u201d\n        I nodded as the last few raindrops fell. \u201cA gyrocompass would be ideal, since the planet\u2019s rotation has been stable for about an Earth year, but I have no idea if the last shipment from Earth had any, or if the expeditionary team managed to add them to our supplies.\u201d\n        The storm seemed to be clearing as quickly as it had come up, revealing a bluish-gray sky tending toward twilight. Unfamiliar stars were just becoming visible, and neither of the two moons had risen yet. \n        \u201cOkay, only a magnetic compass, but that\u2019ll at least be mostly useful for pointing us toward the base,\u201d I said once I finished my review of the contents of the case. \u201cThe case is autonomous and mobile, so we won\u2019t have to carry it, but it doesn\u2019t have any smart systems, so we\u2019ll need to link it to our transponders. If I had to guess, it\u2019s probably a two or three day walk back to Alpha Base from here.\u201d\n        \u201cDevin,\u201d Markus said slowly, \u201care we prepared for camping overnight? Do we have enough food and water?\u201d\n        I exhaled slowly. \u201cThe personal survival packs should have three days worth of, well, I guess you\u2019d call them meals. The pouches where everything\u2019s a brick of food. The supply case has a food converter, and since the vegetation here is based off of Earth plants, theoretically anything it puts out is edible.\u201d Gently, I asked, \u201cFirst time mapping a terraformed world?\u201d\n        He shook his head. \u201cNah, first downed plane, though. First crash ever, really.\u201d\n        \u201cGot it.\u201d I gestured up toward the sky. \u201cThe Earth Expeditionary Force, you know, the EEF, who we\u2019re working for? They\u2019ve done this a lot. Enough to develop a protocol and plan for almost any emergency. The really important thing is to not panic, which so far you haven\u2019t, then establish what supplies are available, then figure out if you should head toward base or wait for rescue.\u201d\n        \u201cBasically, follow the training they drill into us every other week?\u201d\n        \u201cExactly.\u201d I pulled out the emergency tent, closed the case, and patted the top of it. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re doing really well for your first crash, Markus. We\u2019ll identify a decently flat spot to set up the tent. At least at this point in the terraforming we don\u2019t have to worry about animals.\u201d\n        He chuckled, then his legs folded underneath him.\n        \u201cUm. Shock, I guess? Sorry,\u201d he mumbled.\n        \u201cNever you mind. I\u2019ve got the tent, we\u2019ll just get you into it. Thank goodness these things have auto-deploy options.\u201d \n        The next morning, I woke up first, and poked my head outside the tent. Aside from the wreck of the plane, it was low, green vegetation as far as the eye could see. We\u2019d have to rely on the compass and other orienteering tricks I\u2019d picked up over my career with Earth Expeditionary Force.\n        This planet, TX-107, had been a nearly Earth-sized ball of dead rock before the terraforming crews started working on it a couple of years ago. The process was pretty smooth at this point in human history: get the planet rotating as close to Earth norms as possible, add water by using any ice available in the star system, seed the planet with various simple bacteria to form a basis for life, then introduce plants to help stabilize the oxygen cycle. Once the planet was stable enough for human habitation, a base was established, followed by exploration and mapping. I\u2019d asked at one point, early on, why the EEF didn\u2019t just use satellite mapping. The instructor made the point that it\u2019s one thing to see an environment, and another to experience it.\n        \u201cMorning, Devin,\u201d Markus called sleepily from the tent. \u201cI\u2019ve had breakfast, or at least eaten my first meal brick of the day.\u201d\n        I laughed. \u201cGood. We\u2019ll need to get moving soon. We don\u2019t have comms since there aren\u2019t any satellites, so our best bet is to head toward Alpha Base.\u201d\n        He poked his head out and blinked a bit. \u201cI remember you looking over the data last night. You know which way we\u2019re supposed to go?\u201d\n        I gestured away from the rising sun. \u201cThe planet rotates the same way Earth does and according to our mapping data, magnetic north isn\u2019t that far off from the axis of rotation. We\u2019ll be heading west-northwest, but stop every so often and take readings. Now that you\u2019re up, I\u2019ll have my meal brick. Then we\u2019ll pack up and head out.\u201d\n        At first, the hiking was fairly simple. The terrain was mostly flat, our supply case could easily keep up with us, and our exosuits meant that we could maintain a steady pace. To keep from getting bored, Markus and I exchanged stories about our time with the EEF. This was his third world, while this was my seventh. His worst experience had been on a world where there were constant dust storms, thanks to some malfunctions in the plant phase of terraforming. Mine had been the water-world; they\u2019d put us into mermaid-class exosuits, and it took me a couple of weeks just to adapt to the tail.\n        By midday, we\u2019d covered a good amount of distance, but Markus pointed out a range of low hills ahead while we were eating our second food brick.\n        \u201cDoes the mapping data say anything about those?\u201d\n        I checked the mapping comp and whistled. \u201cThey\u2019re taller than they look from here, though after them, it\u2019s flat the rest of the way to base. We should be able to manage the climb, but I don\u2019t know about our supply case. Or we could go around, but that would add at least another day.\u201d\n        Markus grinned. \u201cSo do we make for the Gap of Rohan or do we risk Moria?\u201d\n        I started laughing, glad to have been paired with a fellow geek. \u201cI wish our food bricks were \u2018lembas\u2019! Let\u2019s see what the supply case can make out of the local vegetation.\u201d\n        Markus watched my face fall as I tapped away at the food converter. \n        \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said, \u201cbad news?\u201d\n        \u201cIt looks like none of the edible plant strains took,\u201d I answered. \u201cAt least not in this area. They\u2019ll need a botanist to figure out what happened, but for right now we\u2019re stuck with food bricks, and unfortunately that means we need to risk Moria.\u201d\n        He nodded and began packing up. \u201cDo you want me to check the map for any possible routes?\u201d\n        I nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to be careful with our food, but as long as we don\u2019t have to backtrack, we should still be on schedule.\u201d\n        Markus found us a path through the hills, though there were spots the case couldn\u2019t traverse without assistance. Neither of us wanted to add more weight to our survival packs, and agreed that lifting the case over rock falls was preferable.\n        About midway through the hills, right as the sun was beginning to set, we stopped to make camp. After our food brick dinner, once we\u2019d settled into our tent for the night, Markus stared up at the ceiling and asked, \u201cDo you ever miss people? Like, I'm people, but more people?\u201d\n        \u201cNot really. I\u2019m comfortable on my own or with a few people around, but crowds make me anxious. I never really got the hang of them, which was weird because I grew up in the New Columbia habitat.\u201d\n        \u201cBut that\u2019s the most populated habitat off-Earth!\u201d\n        \u201cExactly. I grew up trying to find places that didn\u2019t have throngs of people, and never succeeded until I started with EEF. What about you?\u201d\n        \u201cEh. This is my third planet because I take breaks from EEF work, go home, and stay with extended family. Eventually, I need a break from them, and I sign up for another planet.\u201d\n        \u201cI hope the enforced isolation isn\u2019t getting to you?\u201d I turned to face him, and watched him grin.\n        \u201cNot really. I\u2019ll be honest, if we had access to edible plant stock, I\u2019d have suggested the long way around. Just to have more time away from everything.\u201d\n        I laughed. \u201cPeas in a pod, we are. Sleep well.\u201d\n        The next day went far more smoothly. The path down out of the hills was easier, and we made up for some of the time we\u2019d lost in what we\u2019d christened the Misty Mountains. The map data showed we were still on course for Alpha Base, and I\u2019d relaxed enough around Markus to talk a bit more about my past. Mostly about my experiences on other terraformed worlds, and the people I\u2019d met there. He told me about his family, and how he loved them, but mostly in small doses.\n        A storm hit the second night, and while our tent and gear was solidly anchored, I\u2019ll admit I stayed up a bit late, listening to the rain. It never rained back in New Columbia, so the sound reminded me just how far I\u2019d come since growing up the youngest child in my family.\n        Some time in the middle of the night, Markus woke me up from a deep sleep. I saw some concern on his face, and he gestured out beyond the doors of the tent.\n        \u201cThe rain stopped, but it looks like the water is starting to collect here, and I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to stop. It\u2019s not that deep right now, but we should get moving.\u201d\n        I nodded, a bit groggy, and we packed up and headed out as quickly as we could. Over the next half hour, we moved through increasingly deeper water, heading for higher ground as best as we could. Our exosuits and the supply case were water-tight, but neither of us wanted to really test that if we didn\u2019t have to.\n        By the time we\u2019d gotten to dry land, both Markus and I needed to rest and clean off our exosuits. The pond looked more and more like a lake as the minutes passed, our previous campsite now fully underwater. I shivered a bit, yawned, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get to higher ground. We didn\u2019t get enough sleep.\u201d\n        Thankfully, when we set up camp in the new location, the tent stayed dry. We got a later start than either of us intended, but after the excitement of the previous night, neither of us were feeling all that energetic.\n        \u201cThe mapping data says we ought to reach Alpha Base sometime late this afternoon. Are you ready?\u201d I looked at Marcus, blearily munching his way through his food brick. He nodded.\n        \u201cHow did we mess that up, Devin?\u201d\n        I shook my head. \u201cWe got complacent. Didn\u2019t check the elevation before we set up camp. Plus, the storm was kind of sudden, and without satellites we don\u2019t have proper weather warnings. At least you were looking out for us. Thank you.\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He finished his food, then hefted his pack back onto his shoulders. \u201cOne more break for lunch, then we should be back at base, right?\u201d\n        \u201cThat sounds like a plan. I think I\u2019ll ask to sleep in a real bed tonight.\u201d\n        He chuckled wearily. \u201cWhat, the sleeping bags aren\u2019t comfortable enough for you?\u201d\n        I laughed as we started moving. \n        Today\u2019s hike was much quieter. Both of us were tired from the previous night\u2019s \u201cadventure,\u201d and with our goal close by, neither of us were in the mood for more than focusing on one foot in front of the other.\n        Which meant that we didn\u2019t hear or see the rover until it was practically on top of us. \n\t\u201cHey, you two, you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes!\u201d Stacey Janssen was in charge of our division of the EEF.\n\tI responded, \u201cYou too, boss.\u201d\n\t\u201cNope, none of that now. We lost your signal back when your plane crashed, but we couldn\u2019t get a satellite up until this morning. Once we spotted you, I volunteered to come get you. Come on, everyone\u2019s waiting back at the base. You\u2019re both officially on rest and recuperation for the next couple of days.\u201d\n\tMarkus managed a smile. \u201cGood. Let\u2019s get loaded up. I\u2019m looking forward to something other than food bricks.\u201d"}

","targets":"        \u201cWe were all at once terribly alone; and alone we must see it through.\u201d\n        Perhaps All Quiet on the Western Front is not the best choice for light reading on a plane. Nevertheless, it is what I downloaded onto my phone for the flight. Thank God I wore my ballet flats today or I would never have made the run to my connecting flight. I sink back into my seat. In about ten hours, I will be home with my dog, and soaking in a hot bubble bath.\n        The seat is terrible. Literally the last row all the way in the back of the plane. A man in a military dress uniform takes the seat beside me. Thankfully, he does not attempt a conversation, and instead begins to read from his phone. The flight attendant gives us our usual safety instructions. I turn my phone off. \n        Suddenly, I am being violently shaken. A male voice is yelling at me \u201cWake up! Wake Up! We have to get out of here. Don\u2019t look around, just come with me.\u201d\n        I can\u2019t help but look around. It is an indescribable scene. Plane seats are thrown everywhere toppling over each other. The plane is listing toward the side away from our seats. Water is rushing in from the opposite side of the plane where it is sinking into the water. I feel a strong hand grip my arm and pull me toward the emergency exit. Sitting against the exit is a medical kit and two bags. Alongside them is my bag filled with mini-bags of pretzels and bottles of water. Military man puts a life vest on me. I\u2019m going to be ill.\n        \u201cHold it together,\u201d Military Man sternly orders me. \u201cFocus on my voice. Don\u2019t look around. It\u2019s just the two of us, I already checked. I\u2019m going to open the emergency exit. I need you to get on the slide. Stay by the side and hold it as you slip toward the end so you don\u2019t go off into the water. When you get to the bottom, I\u2019m going to send the bags down to you. Make sure they don\u2019t go into the water, they contain supplies for us. I grabbed what I could quickly gather from the flight attendant station behind our seats.\u201d He tells me as if it is the most natural thing in the world. \n        I start down the slide as instructed, holding tightly to the side to control my descent. I realize that I didn\u2019t take my ballet shoes off before going down. Why am I thinking about this now? Once I\u2019m down, he yells that he is sending the bags to me. After the bags are secured, he slides two metal trays that would normally hold the dinners served on the plane. I have no idea what they are for, but I place them against the bags.\n        Military Man sits at the top of the slide and says, \u201cI am going to release the slide from the door, it will be our raft. Hold on, it will be bumpy at first.\u201d \n        He takes the emergency knife that is packed with the slide in the exit door to cut it away from the plane. It drops several feet to the water and rocks violently. We are now sitting on opposite ends of the rocking raft.\n        \u201cI need you to slide one of the trays toward me. We are going to use them as paddles to move away from the plane and toward that land over there. I\u2019ll tell you when to paddle. Once we\u2019re in a rhythm together, we should make decent progress. The clouds behind us are definitely storm clouds, we want to be off the water before it hits. Given their distance, we should have time to make it to land and put up some shelter. As for right now, we\u2019re in luck, the sun is partially hidden behind the clouds, the waves are small, and the wind is mild.\u201d \n        Military Man is talking like all this is normal. We are just going to paddle away from the plane in what I imagine to be shark infested waters toward an unknown piece of land. There is a bad storm on the horizon, but not to worry, we will be tucked away in a shelter before it hits. Don\u2019t look at the plane. Don\u2019t think about what happened, what is happening.\n        We just have to paddle away from the plane, I repeat to myself. I start to look toward the wreckage slowly sinking into the water. Black plumes of thick smoke are billowing from the plane. It starts to sink in that we were just in a plane crash. The two of us. There are only two of us. I look around for other rafts. I feel panic overwhelm me. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s just us, I checked before I woke you. Don\u2019t look at it. Focus on paddling. When I say paddle, dip the tray in the water in a deep even stroke. Paddle.\u201d There is a pause and he again says matter of factly,  \u201cPaddle.\u201d\n        That is what I hear in my head now. Paddle. Pause. Paddle. Pause. The only other sound I hear is the sloshing of the water.  I don\u2019t know how much time has passed, however, given the location of the sun, I think it is late afternoon. Perhaps three or four. I start to realize that my arms are really sore, and I\u2019m thirsty. The temperature is around eighty degrees, I think. It could be worse, we could still be in the plane. Stop! I tell myself. Don\u2019t go down that rabbit hole, you can\u2019t right now, focus on the paddle commands. The word paddle is the only barrier between my ability to function and soul crushing hysteria. \n        Suddenly the raft violently shakes. I look back at Military Man. He just jumped out of the raft, and is knee deep in water. How did I miss that we are almost to the shore? I know why. Paddling. I let my mind be consumed by paddling.\n        \u201cOk, I need you to hop out now. Leave your shoes in the raft. Be careful, it is really rocky here. We need to get the raft out of the water onto the beach. I need you to come by me so we can both pull from the same end. I\u2019ll help you out, don\u2019t worry. This is going to be our shelter tonight.\u201d Military Man explains to me.\n        I awkwardly get out of the raft. Military Man grabs my arm to steady me. The water is just above my knees. My jeans feel heavy as I try to take steps. They get heavier as the water gets more shallow. We pull the raft onto the beach.\n        \u201cThere,\u201d he says, \u201cLet\u2019s try to get the raft by that group of rocks.\u201d \n        He takes out the knife and cuts the raft in a few places to deflate it. The raft is so very heavy. It has the added weight of the few bags still inside it. Military man is doing most of the heavy lifting, or pulling. We make it to the rocks. They are about twelve feet away from where the sand is wet on the beach. He indicates that I can let go of the raft. He stopped in front of a spot shaped like the letter \u201cU.\u201d\n        \u201cWe are going to take a break and have some water and food. Then we are going to attach the raft to the jagged pieces of rock to make a roof for ourselves. The rock itself will give us three walls. It will give us some protection from the incoming storm. I\u2019m going to need you to take off your jeans so that I can use part of the leg portion to make strips to tie the raft to the rocks. I'll be doing the same with my pants. Don\u2019t worry, in one of the bags I have blankets that we can cover up with when the temperature drops at night.\u201d\n        He tosses me a bottle of water, and then a little container of food. \u201cLooks like chicken was on the menu for dinner. Don\u2019t worry. Airplane food is precooked, they only warm it on the flight. You might not feel like eating, but I need you to keep your strength up. Also, we only have chicken to eat now, and later this evening. After that it is pretzels and rolls. I didn\u2019t bother packing extra chicken since it would just go bad. It can only be out a couple of hours, so there was no reason to waste the space,\u201d He explains.\n        How can Military Man be so pragmatic at a time like this? He had to remind me to put my shoes back on once we were out of the water. The beach is rocky. Without the shoes, it would have been even more difficult to get the raft over here. The shoes saved my feet.\n        I look toward the water and hear \u201cDon\u2019t look there, focus on eating. This is a short break, given the pace clouds are rolling in, we have about an hour or two before the storm hits.\u201d He states matter of factly.\n        I do my best to eat the chicken. It gets stuck in my throat. For some reason swallowing is really hard. As I finish my chicken, Military Man says \u201cI need your pants now, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep my back turned, just toss them to me. Once I cut the bottom part of the legs off, I\u2019ll toss them back to you.\u201d\n        In just a few minutes the two of us are wearing \u201cshorts.\u201d I watch him make strips of material. I feel utterly useless right now. To me, nature is Central Park. Spoiler alert, I also hate camping. My dog is probably wondering where I am right now. My friend is supposed to drop her off at the apartment for me so that she is there when I arrive. I hope my friend knows I\u2019m not coming home. Oh, my God! Hysteria wells within me. I am about to be overtaken by it. I\u2019m reaching the point of no return.\n        \u201cHey!\u201d He yells, \u201cKeep it together, not yet. We have to make shelter, and I need your help for that. We can fall apart later, but not now.\u201d He splashes a bit of water from his bottle onto my face. I sputter. How dare he! I am so angry at him and I am about to give him a piece of my mind, when I see from his expression that is exactly what he wants. He is trying to help me get a grip.\n        I can\u2019t find my voice, and he seems to understand that. He begins to tell me in a calm tone the steps we are going to take to make our shelter. It is not easy. However, after what seems to me a long time, we have a roof that tilts down on one side. I\u2019m told that the slant will help keep it up during the rain. It\u2019s not sturdy enough to hold puddles of water.\n        He brings the bags under our roof. It is only a small area of shelter, but it is large enough for the two of us and our bags. I lean against the rock. Military Man tells me he will be back and walks toward a little grove of trees. There are only a few, and they are not massive trees. They are more like large bushes. \n        I notice that the water is getting very rough. The waves crash violently upon the rocks. The wind is picking up. We are far enough away from the water that the waves cannot reach us here. I don\u2019t see the plane.\n        Military Man comes back with some branches and places them against the rocks under our roof. He makes a couple more trips and forms a small pile. He places the bags in front of them, and then sits beside me.\n        \u201cI estimate we are about fifteen to twenty nautical miles from where the plane went down. We are lucky the current and waves helped bring us in, or we might still be paddling. Given the look of the clouds and the haze the storm is probably pretty bad out there. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure they already have Search and Rescue on the way to the last location ping the plane gave. We are in the normal search radius for a rescue. It may take a day or two, but they will find us. We have wood to make a fire on the beach when the storm is over. We have bottles of water, and food such as it is, so we will be fine until then.\u201d He tells me. \n        So, the wood is not for a fire to keep us warm at night. It is a beacon to let the rescuers know where we are. It is really dark now. The storm clouds came in fast. There is a flash of lightning and a large crash of thunder. I hear myself scream. Suddenly I double over and begin to sob. I can\u2019t stop.  Military Man gets one of our blankets and wraps it around me. I sink against him and feel him rubbing my back. The rain starts to pour and the wind makes a slapping sound against our little roof. My sobbing continues.\n        I hear Military Man saying \u201cHey, wake up! Are you alright?\u201d \n        I open my eyes and I am so confused. My head is against the side of the plane and I am looking out the window. There are clouds all around us. Light flashes inside the clouds and I hear thunder. \n        \u201cYou were having a nightmare, I think. Make sure you are buckled in, the pilot put the fasten seat belt sign back on. We can expect a bit of turbulence according to the pilot, but nothing to worry about; and thankfully, we are still scheduled to arrive on time in spite of the storm. Our dinner will be served in a few minutes, but, since we are in the delightful seats in the very last row, we will most likely be stuck with the chicken dinner. By the way, my name is Anthony.\u201d He tells me as he gives me a smile.\n        I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m Ivy,\u201d I reply. \u201cThanks for waking me up.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n"}

I wish I had started counting sooner, but one does not expect to be stuck in an airplane crash over and over again.\n        I look over at the screaming woman as she flails her arms wildly in the air. Her husband is making out with the blonde flight attendant. He only does that every other time we crash, and I am wondering if perhaps they knew each other prior to the flight. They seem unencumbered by the masks that have fallen from the airplane ceiling as they awkwardly grope each other in the center aisle.\n        I sit back and adjust my seat for the crash to come. I really wish I had taken that first flight from Atlanta to Bermuda. But then that lady came over the intercom in the airport lounge and offered 1000 sky miles for volunteers to take the next flight, and of course, I leapt at the chance. I love solo travel. As a forty-year-old single woman with no kids, I take great pleasure in my unencumbered adventures abroad. Last year I went to Japan, and the year before that I traveled to India. This year, I decided to stick to this hemisphere and head to the Caribbean. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that all of that Bermuda Triangle nonsense could actually be true.\n        The plane takes a sudden dive. Bags and coats fly about the cabin. One of the flight attendants is thrown off his feet as the man next to me starts to pray in a foreign language. I look out the window and see the ocean rapidly growing closer, and then the crash. \n        For anyone who is wondering, death via plane crash feels like getting punched right in the face, followed by nothing. At least, that is my experience. Only for me, the experience of nothing is quickly followed by me going back in time 21 minutes. Here we go again\n        I stand up, let out a sigh, and waltz into the first-class cabin. Already the masks have dropped from the ceiling, and the airline staff are darting around in a panic, calming the various passengers. I sit in an open seat and hold my open hand on the ground in the aisle on my left. A mini bottle of Irish whiskey rolls into my palm, right on time. I drink it down in one swig and think about all the incredible times I have had in my life. I trekked the trail to Machu Picchu on my twenty-eighth birthday. I went scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia when I turned thirty. I even got to hike Mt. Everest three years ago. I only made it to base camp before I got altitude sickness and had to turn back, but it was an incredible experience nonetheless. Now it appears I am cursed with the worst kind of purgatory: to spend eternity trapped in a crashing plane surrounded by screaming, terrified people with no clue that they are even stuck here.\n        Just as I am lining up my hand to grab the next little rolling bottle of whiskey, I see the pilot sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the cabin of the plane. A stewardess is screaming at him to do something.\n        He looks up at her and says, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it will change anything.\u201d\n        At that moment, we lock eyes with each other. For the first time since this nightmare began, I have a shred of hope. Someone else on the plane is aware that we are stuck in a loop! I stand up and lurch over to him, grabbing the cushiony first-class seats as the plane jerks to the left.\n        I approach him and yell out, \u201cYou are stuck too. Am I right?\u201d\n        \u201cYeppers,\u201d he says in reply. \n        I reach out my hand to him, and he pulls himself up. He looks to be about my age, with red hair and freckles.\n        \u201cI think we have another 15 minutes or so before we crash again. Let\u2019s go into the cockpit and chat,\u201d I say.\n        \u201cSure thing,\u201d says the pilot. \u201cBut I am taking some of these with us.\u201d He grabs a handful of mini-vodka bottles as we move into the flight deck.\n        We go into the empty cockpit. I ask the pilot where the copilot is. He tells me that the last time he saw him, he was hysterically screaming somewhere near seat 17B. \n        \u201cSo much for grace under pressure,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cI guess the two of us will have to handle this. When did you realize that something was wrong with the flight?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, first I noticed that the radio went silent. I don\u2019t mean that it went fuzzy or that the monitor started showing errors. I mean, it went completely dead, as if it wasn\u2019t on at all. At first I thought that maybe I spilled soda on it again like last week, but nope. I sent my copilot to the back of the plane to see if he could find our old radio system in the cargo hold. But then things went downhill quick. As you all in the cabin likely noticed, the plane started off slowly drifting down and then rapidly and irregularly plummeted before the crash.\u201d\n        \u201cSounds about right,\u201d I reply. \u201cSo,I am assuming you did that again a few times, not believing that we could be stuck on repeat. I think it wasn\u2019t until the fourth time that I realized I wasn\u2019t in a dream and this really was happening. What did you try to do then?\"\n        The pilot shakes his head. \u201cI have tried everything. When I feel the plane start to sink, I pull up. When I feel the plane slow down, I try to pump the throttle. Every time and with every countermove, the plane just drifts and crashes. I even had my screaming copilot take over on one of the repeats and do the exact same evasive maneuvers. But we still crash.\u201d\n        \u201cThis may seem crazy, but what if we are being pulled into something over and over again in this loop? What if the only way out is to beat it to the punch?\u201d I say this with great uncertainty in my voice.\n        \u201cYou mean crash the plane before this thing crashes us?\u201d the pilot says.\n        \u201cYes.\u201d I reply.\n        \u201cAt this point, what have we got to lose?\u201d says the pilot. \u201cWe will be crashing again any second now. As soon as the loop starts back up, come up to the cockpit. I will let you in, and we will take this thing down. Together.\u201d [9]\n        At that moment, the ocean meets the front of the plane yet again, and suddenly I am sitting in my seat with all the familiar, terrified faces I had come to know so well over the last dozen crashes. I get up and walk with purpose towards the cockpit, balancing myself against the seats as I move. I see the flight deck door ajar and step inside.\n        \"Let's crash this thing,\" I state bluntly to the pilot.\n        \"Shirley, you can't be serious?\" the pilot says with an awkward grin, awaiting the classic Airplane movie answer.\n        \u201cNo. Just... No. Also, shut up,\u201d I say with great annoyance.\n        \u201cOK, cranky.\u201d He replies with an eye roll. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\n        In one swift motion, the pilot manipulates the controls, and we are in a steep dive towards the ocean. For the first time in a while, we are not on a steady course to a crash in 21 minutes. Instead we are on a steady course to crash in about 21 seconds. Before I can even shout for the pilot to pull up, a black void opens in the sea below us. The pilot locks eyes with me, and suddenly there is a deep and silent darkness.\n        I open my eyes to discover that we are on dry land, at least partially. My head is spinning. I turn to the pilot and shake his shoulder. He lifts his head from the control panel, and a trickle of blood makes its way down the side of his nose. But otherwise, he appears okay. \n        \u201cWhere did we land?\u201d the pilot says?\n        \u201cDo I look like I would know?\u201d I reply.\n        I peer out the cockpit window and see that the head of the plane is nestled firmly in a rock formation on what appears to be an island. We both get out of our seats and walk back into the cabin. We are the only people on the plane. Every single other person is gone. We open the door and pop out the yellow emergency slide. Bouncing down our rubbery escape, our feet hit the beach, squeaking in the sand, and we glance around dumbfounded.\n        Floating in the waters ahead of us are a variety of ships. I see what looks like a fifteenth-century Spanish galleon moving aimlessly on the horizon. An old steamboat is anchored on the sandbar of the island, a Confederate flag still flying from its mast.  Not far from our plane, the skeletal remains of a wrecked Viking longship jut out of the rocks.\n        I stare with my jaw hanging open, only to have the pilot tug on my sleeve. I turn to see a small, damaged biplane a quarter of a mile down the beach and a woman approaching us on foot. \n        \"Is that Hilary Swank?\" the pilot asks, squinting in the sunshine.\n        \"What is wrong with you?\" I respond.\n        As the woman approaches us, I notice that she is tall. She looks to be around my age. She has short, wavy, bobbed hair cut in a flapper style and piercing gray eyes. She wears a leather pilot\u2019s jacket and cropped riding pants with brown boots. Stopping in front of us, she holds out her hand in greeting.\n        \u201cAmelia Earhart. Nice to meet you. Let me guess. You flew into the hole. I hope you like the beach because we may be here for a while.\u201d \n"}

Ghosts, which is what I am, tend to fall into a few different categories.\n        First are the roamers. Hitchhiking ghosts are a good example. Roamers can travel, but mostly that\u2019s because they have to. \n        Then there are the connected, or at least that\u2019s what they call themselves. They\u2019re not so common because they\u2019re linked with a person, a family, or an entire bloodline. \n        And lastly, at least for the major groupings, are the bound. That\u2019s what I am. I\u2019m bound to a house and I can\u2019t step outside of it. \n        Thanks to the occasional roamer or connected visiting my house, I know at least this much. \n        Back in the 80s, well, there was the AIDS epidemic, which strongly affected gay men. A bunch of us lesbians stepped up, since the families wouldn\u2019t acknowledge their child existed, and we were all part of a community. We sat with them, brought them food, and stayed with them while they were dying so they didn\u2019t have to do it alone. There were never enough of us, but we tried.\n        Somewhere along the way, I accidentally got stuck by an infected needle. One of the nurses wasn\u2019t being so good with biohazard materials, so I ended up dealing with it for this one guy, Jesse. AIDS hit me hard, probably because I\u2019d been spending so much of my time and energy taking care of other people. Six months after I got infected, I died in my bed at home.\n        Most ghosts have some kind of unfinished business, at least the ones I know of. I know I never really let go of that \u201ctaking care of people\u201d energy even after death. Since I owned the house outright, it wasn\u2019t like my parents could come in and take it over, but the property got tied up in probate for a while. My brother decided to contest the will, arguing that because I\u2019d contracted AIDS, I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. Eventually, the courts decided in his favor. It probably wouldn\u2019t have fallen out that way if this hadn\u2019t been the early 80s, but at the time nobody wanted anything to do with those of us who\u2019d gotten the disease.\n        I only learned about this after the fact, when he started moving his stuff in and getting rid of everything I\u2019d ever owned. He said awful things to his lawyer, his real estate agent, and our parents, things I never expected to hear out of him. I don\u2019t know how I ended up with such a hate-filled little brother, but he wasn\u2019t shy about expressing his opinions.\n        So he moved into my home, and I made sure he moved out in less than six months. I\u2019ll admit, I played on his homophobia more than a little; even though I was dead, it was still my home, and he didn\u2019t deserve to live there.\n        Once my brother was out of the picture, one of the roamers, a young woman named Melinda, taught me everything she could. To this day, she comes by as frequently as she can, given that she can\u2019t stay in one place for very long.\n        I found out that my brother had sold the house only after this lovely gay couple moved in. Of course, they couldn\u2019t just say they were gay, but despite telling the world they were just \u201croommates,\u201d I picked up on it immediately. I didn\u2019t know them from when I was alive, but I did everything I could to make them feel welcome and safe. Roger and Brian stayed for almost a decade, until Brian got a promotion that took him across the country. Thankfully, same-sex couples were slowly gaining acceptance, and Brian\u2019s company didn\u2019t drag their heels too much on the subject of him bringing his partner.\n        By that point, though, my humble little home in San Francisco had shot up in value. And the man who\u2019d bought the house, he\u2019d promised Roger and Brian he\u2019d keep things as they were as part of the deal. Only to gloat about \u201cflipping\u201d the house within weeks of closing the sale. \n        I\u2019d gotten very good over the years at manipulating things inside my home, especially with Melinda helping. It didn\u2019t take Brad all that long to get spooked about the house he thought would turn an easy profit once he \u201cspruced it up a little.\u201d I might have gone a bit too far at the end, where I painted one blank wall in blood with the words \u201cPlague House.\u201d But Brad certainly didn\u2019t stick around all that long after he watched it happen right in front of him. I won\u2019t deny that I got a certain amount of satisfaction watching him bolt outside, throw up in the neighbor\u2019s garden, then get in his fancy Porsche and drive away, never to be seen again.\n        Then my home sat empty for a couple of years. Sure, there were showings and the like, but after a decade or so of being dead, well, I\u2019d learned to read people\u2019s auras and figure out pretty quickly whether they were the sort I\u2019d want in my home. And sadly, most of the people the real estate agent brought through weren\u2019t the sort I\u2019d have been nice to when I was alive. At least Melinda kept coming by to keep me company and fill me in on the state of things.\n        Eventually, Lisa and Ken were the ones to make an offer the agent wasn\u2019t interested in refusing, and were people I liked from the first time they walked into my home. They were a cute couple, deeply in love with each other, and happy with the way the home was set up. After moving in, the two of them started talking to the house, things like asking permission before updating the wiring or changing something else major. I wasn\u2019t ever sure if they could see me, or if they just thought the house was alive, but it didn\u2019t really matter. \n        And two years later, Ken came out to Lisa, so Kendra started dressing up around the house, to Lisa\u2019s approval and relief. She once whispered that she knew Ken was transgender and was just waiting for her to feel safe and comfortable enough to come out. She thanked the house for being so good to them both. \n\tI\u2019ll admit, I got a warm glow from the whole thing. Back in my day, I\u2019d known some folk who knew they were women or men all along, no matter what anyone else saw, and I did what I could to help them. I did the same for Kendra, even helped make things easier after the rounds of surgeries she did to make her body fit herself better. It helped that Lisa\u2019s employer was very progressive, and that Kendra had a loving family. \n        Sadly, about five years in, Lisa\u2019s parents got really sick, and she and Kendra moved out to take care of them. They kept the house as a rental, and did everything they could to vet potential renters, but this was in the days before viable videoconferencing was a thing. Which meant I got stuck briefly with Julie.\n        She tried to be good, she really did. But she had the worst track record with men and women, bringing them over for a night or a weekend, and never noticing their bad sides. I tried to give her as many hints as I could, from things like putting Jake\u2019s shoes next to the door to practically freezing Marla out of the shower. I don\u2019t know why Julie\u2019s radar for people was so bad, and I didn\u2019t want to make her leave. But when Fergie tried to steal Julie\u2019s rent money, I determined I\u2019d had enough. Nobody I disapproved of was getting more than five feet inside my home. \n        Julie moved out after a month when she literally couldn\u2019t bring any date inside. I swear, that woman needed some serious therapy and a good swift kick to the rear. The last I saw of her, she was sobbing on Amanda\u2019s shoulders as the two of them walked the last box to the moving truck.\n        Kendra came back for three months, and spent most of it cleaning and fixing things up. She also spent a lot of it talking out loud to me, well, the house. \u201cGeez, I thought Julie was a good kid, that\u2019s why we went with her,\u201d she said after taking out the garbage for the fourth time. Or, \u201cI wish Julie would have listened to you the way we did.\u201d She told me all about Lisa\u2019s parents, and how happy she was with Lisa, and the best I could do was make sure my home was as comforting as it always had been. \n        But eventually Kendra had to go back, and Sam moved in as the next renter. Deep down, Sam was good people, but she had a busload of anger and nowhere to put it except into her music. She introduced me to a broad variety of music, punk and indie and so many other genres I hadn\u2019t known about while I was alive. At least the dead can learn new things, thank goodness. I did what I could, so the music wouldn\u2019t disturb the neighbors, and Sam got a solid nine months of alone time before things started changing. \n        Sam brought Ivy home with her after a night at the club. Ivy was a goth. Ivy also said she was a witch. And even though Sam knew about the \u201cspooky\u201d history of my home, including everything I had done to drive my brother and Brad away, Ivy was the first to believe there was a ghost in the house.\n        Sam didn\u2019t think it was real until I started using the letters of her breakfast cereal to spell out messages. Me telling her not to freak out had the opposite effect, but Ivy bounced up and down like a giddy child.\n        Ivy was good about trying to communicate with me. She tried a Ouija board, but that lasted about five minutes before we both started laughing too much. The magnetic poetry was a decent idea, but the kits are all really limited and not suited for, \u201cHey, don\u2019t turn up the volume too much, the neighbors are starting to notice.\u201d I certainly didn\u2019t want to write in blood the way I\u2019d done to scare Brad out of my home.\n        We finally settled on a typewriter. I was very good at pushing material things after nearly twenty years as a ghost, and the newer typewriters required less effort. I think Sam would rather have used a computer, but there wasn\u2019t any reasonable way to set one up only so I could talk with her.\n        Kendra and Lisa came to visit about six months after we\u2019d worked out how to communicate. The two of them were floored, but adapted fairly quickly. Typing was far slower than talking, but in a few hours I\u2019d told them pretty much everything. Lisa at least knew the history of the AIDS epidemic well enough to tell the others, and we commiserated at the state of the world and how acceptance of LGBT people seemed to be taking forever. \n        \u201cSo why didn\u2019t Julie work out? She seemed like a nice girl, and she was bi,\u201d Kendra asked finally.\n        I typed out, \u201cShe had horrible taste in men and women. They were all bad for her, one way or another. One of them even tried to steal her rent money.\u201d\n        I think at first they were worried that I was being biased or, in the words of Sam, \u201ccranky\u201d about Julie. But once I explained that I liked her, but the people she kept trying to date were actually harmful to her, the four of them looked at each other and nodded.\n        \u201cSo how do we fix this in future? I don\u2019t think Sam and Ivy are going to live here forever,\u201d Kendra said dryly, with Sam blushing a bit.\n        \u201cNah, my band is really taking off. They\u2019re talking about a tour.\u201d\n        Ivy grinned at Sam, then looked over at the typewriter. \u201cI\u2019d like to volunteer, actually. To stay here, help our ghost determine who\u2019s a good fit and who isn\u2019t. It is a three-bedroom house. Maybe we can make it a safer space for LGBT people?\u201d\n        I typed with amusement, \u201cThat was my intent all along.\u201d I paused. \u201cAnd my name is Beverly.\u201d\n        Eventually, Kendra and Lisa permanently moved up to Seattle, into a house that was decidedly less haunted, but Ivy stayed, content with me as a roommate. She\u2019s pretty special herself, and in the past couple of decades we\u2019ve worked out a lot of things, including how to communicate, how to spot potential renters, and keep the people and my house safe from trouble.\n        Which is why you\u2019re reading this. Ivy met with you, and thought you\u2019d be a good fit. How do you feel about living in a haunted house?"}

Like a bullet to the heart or a head-on car wreck. It should.\u201d\n        Under the Tuscan Sun, what a brilliant movie. I dry my eyes with a tissue. This movie mirrors my life. It is my inspiration for the forthcoming ghosting of my life. You see, I just got out of a bad relationship and do not know what to do with myself; so I decide, rather romantically I might add, to lean more or less into Diane Lane\u2019s character and cash out of this sad existence with a permanent move to Tuscany. \n        Thus, as my life unravels, I make plans for my ghosting. I buy a villa in Tuscany, just outside one of the smaller towns. The villa has everything I need, including a library stocked with my favorite books, a new computer, pads of paper and pens, and of course internet and cable. Villa might be a strong word for the one story abode, the realtor calls it a two story house, but villa sounds romantic and I\u2019m going with it. \n        As luck would have it, finally for me, the location of my new home is near a large enough town that I can easily get what I need without drawing attention to myself. A bonus since I really need some alone time right now, at least to start. My new villa is about two miles outside town and off the beaten path. It\u2019s mostly fields and cypress trees. Unless people are hiking in the area, there is not much reason to pass by my new place. However, It is close enough for delivery and groundskeeping crews to come tend the yard or make any repairs I might need. \n        The town is large enough that should I wander through, no one will notice an extra person. Yet, it is still small enough to be quaint and affordable. Since I\u2019m ghosting my life, it will be nice to live somewhere that I will actually have a chance to ghost. In fact, one of the reasons  I\u2019m able to afford this place is because a friend of mine knows a realtor trying to sell a small villa, in great condition, in a low demand area. So, with the little bit of conversational Italian I know, and the help of the realtor and internet, it is time to ghost my life.\n        Life after my former life has been brilliant, I must say. I even have a dog, named Chimera. For me, ghost life mostly resembles my former life, except it is less stressful.  Chimera\u2019s food is delivered, along with anything else I need, by a grocery service. They leave everything at the gate, and this system is working well.  I\u2019ve only been here a few weeks, but I\u2019m totally relaxing and my writer's block is fading. I mean, this ghost works hard for her money.\n        My ghosting days have fallen into a comfortable routine starting with morning coffee followed by a walk with Chimera. A short walk, I might add because it is cold. I then spend most of the day trying to write. In the evenings, I light the fireplace (it is gas, so really easy to use) and read. Sometimes I watch television to help spur my learning of the language. I\u2019m also teaching Chimera some commands in Italian. \n        It\u2019s a cold December day, and I finally decide to go into town. I\u2019m wearing my long woolen cape with a silver Celtic knot clasp. You know, the type that you read about in Victorian novels. It even has a hood. As I walk through the cobblestone streets, I hear people talking about the haunted villa just outside town. Some claim there are lights on at night, and they see a figure, a shadow through the dark curtains covering the windows. These tales all originate from their husbands who had a guys night one evening and came home a little into their cups claiming they saw lights in the window of the old witch Clara\u2019s house, but she has been dead for over a year. Spooky, I think with a laugh.\n        Children excitedly add, with a slight tone of fear, that they see a dog running in the yard, but it won\u2019t come to them when they call. They are certain the dog must be a ghost, even though it leaves paw prints in the snow. Some ghosts leave tracks, they argue. Adults warn the children to stay away, or they will be cursed with the evil eye. For as the town gossip goes, it is the ghost of a witch that haunts the villa. \n        As I walk past the gossiping people unnoticed, I think to myself that this is a very charming tale, and I must go to the villa to see these hauntings for myself. Then I realize, it is me they are whispering about. I am the ghost witch haunting the villa. Clara was the name of the previous owner, the realtor informed me when giving me the rundown about the house. They think that I am the ghost of Clara. The thought makes me laugh. It is a great character idea for my story; the ghost of the Witch of Tuscany. A tale forged by superstition, a mean elderly neighbor labeled a witch who died, young children, and tipsy husbands. Suddenly, I\u2019m excited to get back to the villa I haunt and start writing.\n        Being a ghostwriter (see what I did there, ha!) is fantastic. It is a new chapter in my way of being in the world. I am moving past all the bad things that happened to me in life, and I am focused on what makes me happy; writing and my dog. I love my study; it's so cozy and has a gas fireplace. The scent of pine scented candles fills the room as I write. Not bad for a life, after my previous existence. \n        Presently, I\u2019m content. My book is coming along, and, as an added bit of happiness, my villa is looking very festive. It is all decorated for the winter holidays! Twinkling lights and candles fill the rooms. There is a holiday pine tree decorated with silver, red, blue, green, and purple glass ornaments that sparkle amongst the lights. At the bottom of the tree, there is a silver skirt with embossed snowflakes. Chimera likes to sleep on it. \n        After a long day of writing, I love to take bubble bath. It helps me to think through my ideas. Sinking into the warm lavender scented water is pure bliss. Scented candles add to the relaxing fragrance, and Enya\u2019s Only Time is softly playing in the background. I hear myself singing \u201cWho can say where the road goes? Where the day flows? Only time.\u201d It\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know where my road is going, but at least now I am enjoying the journey. This moment right now is bliss. \n        Chimera starts barking madly. There are loud noises coming from the porch. I jump out of the tub and throw on my lavender robe as I rush to the door. I push the door open and there are three people outside with crowbars. They scream when they see me and try to run off the porch. \n        Unfortunately, or perhaps deservedly, they knock into each other and fall into a sad frantically moaning heap of tangled limbs and scarfs. Well, this certainly ruins my bath mood.  \n        It is clear from their business attire that they are not dangerous criminals, however they were still attempting to break into my home. Nevertheless, I ask them, \u201cAre you folks okay?\u201d I walk toward the pile of people, so I can help them up. Oh my God, my feet are freezing on the cold salty porch. Note to self: get slippers in case random people from town try to break into the house. \n        As I reach out to help the first person up they scream \u201cAHHHHHHHHHH, I didn\u2019t know you can feel a ghost. She has my arm! Help me!\u201d \n        The second person cries out \u201cWe are going to catch the evil eye!\u201d\n        Calmly I explain to them, \u201cYou can\u2019t catch the evil eye, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n        The third person whimpers, \u201cWhat do you want with us?\u201d\n        What do I want with them indeed, as if they are not in this position because they were attempting a break in. In a deeply exasperated tone I say \u201cI would like to know why you are trying to break into my home.\u201d\n        The first person pulls their arm away from me and says \u201cWe thought this villa was empty, after the witch Clara died, and we were checking it out as a venue for our town holiday party. The place we usually have it just had a pipe break and the water damage won\u2019t be cleaned up in time. Honestly, we thought this place was abandoned. The only people we have seen here for the last year are the people the realtor pays to keep the grounds up. Admittingly, none of us are around this area much, so we might have missed some things\u201d\n        Well that clears everything up in a funny irresponsible sort of way. Good thing for them that I\u2019m a writer and have an appreciation for people and characters who are slightly misbegotten. Even so, I\u2019m surprised that they so casually explain their breaking and entering away. Apparently, their need for a holiday venue justifies the crime in their minds. That and this place, they thought was abandoned, belonged to a mean lady that the gossip mongers labeled a witch. Holidays do bring out the crazy in people. \n        \u201cClearly it\u2019s not an abandoned house. Next time, before you try to break into a place with lights on, perhaps knock first? Even if there is only a ghost, I\u2019m sure they will appreciate the courtesy. By the way, my name is Flora,\u201d I tell them. I continue, \u201cAlso, if you know the realtor, why didn\u2019t you ask them if you could use the house before trying to force open the door?\u201d\n        \u201cThey don\u2019t live in town, they work out of Milan. We didn\u2019t think anyone would know or care. The villa has been on the market for over a year. Since the mean lady, who owned this house and was known as the town witch died, it just became popular consensus when strange activity occurred here that she was haunting this place. This story built over time. By the way, my name is Toni.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m Francesca, and that is Sophie,\u201d the person next to Toni added.\n        \u201cNice to meet you folks, let\u2019s go inside to talk. It is freezing out here.\u201d They all notice my bare feet as Chimera comes bursting out the door. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chimera is friendly, she loves people,\u201d I tell them. \n        As we go inside the house, I explain to them that I had a rough patch in life and decided to start over in Tuscany. I think of this as my ghost life, since I literally ghosted my life to start over here. However, now surrounded by people, I\u2019m beginning to think that perhaps the life of a ghost is overrated. I need to get out more and mingle with people. Especially here, what a source of inspiration for my writing, I think wryly. \n        After a moment, I break out of my thoughts as I realize they are speaking to me. I was not noticed on my few visits to town, they explained to me, because this time of year there are a lot of visitors, and of course a few tourists. My place, they continue, is just off the beaten path enough that the few times people passed by were enough to cause the gossip drama about the Witch of Tuscany. Moreover, the realtor did not notify anyone that the villa was sold, as they have in the past. Voil\u00e0, tales grow and become exaggerated until here we all are in my living room. \n        We all have a good laugh about the misunderstanding. Since they didn\u2019t damage the door or window as luckily they didn\u2019t know how to use a crowbar, I decide to let this episode go as a good story to tell. In fact, I might even add this into my book, names and precise location changed of course. \n        We have a wonderful visit, and they offer to give me a tour of the town when the weather is warmer. For my part, I tell them they can host the party here. It will be fun, and a new adventure for me. After all, I really do need to stop spending so much time alone, and this is the perfect way for me to meet some new people. Plus, stories need inspiration, so a holiday party at my place, here I come!\n        A few weeks later, laughter fills my home. The rooms are full of people mingling and eating the delicious food donated by various businesses. A string quartet plays festive music.\n        I see Toni come over. They hand me a glass of wine. Francesca and Sophie soon join us. We are all enjoying the holiday spirit together, and we agree that making new friends is the best gift of all. \u201cSalute!\u201d "}

The story should be between 1900 and 2000 words long.","targets":"        Caroline floated softly through the second floor of the mansion wearing a blue gown over a tight corset, a classic silhouette from the Gilded Age. The year was actually 1961, and Caroline was a Victorian-era ghost. While she could not wear the current fashion of the day, she enjoyed seeing each new trend through the families that came and went in her nearly 150-year old home. As she passed the master bedroom, she noticed an array of beautiful dresses carefully arranged in the closet, indicating the imminent arrival of the new family. Letitia, the oldest ghost in their trio, unsurprisingly had the most difficulty adjusting to these changes. Meanwhile, Ellen, the newest addition to their little crew, delighted in the shifts. \n        Caroline had overheard the head chef telling the housekeeping staff that the family would be all moved in today. One of the maids responded that the wife was very much into decor and would be restoring some of the larger rooms to their former glory. \n        Caroline passed by various movers, painters, and repairmen, unnoticed in her ghostly form. She moved into the East Room, a large and formal state room full of old-world grandeur. Two late nineteenth-century Bohemian glass chandeliers hung in the large room, and a vast Persian carpet covered the hardwood floors. At the center of the room, a black Steinway grand piano beckoned to any visitors with a pinch of musical talent. There, sitting on the piano bench, was Letitia. Caroline figured she would be there, as the bench offered the perfect viewing position for her husband's portrait.\n        \u201cHello, Letitia. How are you today?\u201d\n        Letitia gave a sniffle and dabbed at her cheek with a handkerchief. She spoke loudly in a rolling Tidewater, Virginia, accent. \u201cHow do you think I am? Yet again, our home is being invaded. I saw the lady of the house outside. She wears some sort of hat called a \u2018pillbox.\u2019 And she is from New York. And the husband is even worse! A descendant of Boston rum runners and northern politicians.\u201d \n        \"Now, Letitia, I am sure you thought much the same about me when I moved in with Benjamin all those years ago,\u201d Caroline said in reply.\n        \u201cYes, but you at least were the daughter of a good, Presbyterian family. The housekeeper said that\u2026they are Catholics!\u201d Letitia whispered the last words as if they were profanity.\n        At that very moment, Ellen waltzed into the room. Unlike Letitia and Caroline, who were decked out in the trappings of the nineteenth-century, Ellen wore the more slimmed-down clothing of an early-twentieth-century woman. She had vivid auburn, curly hair tied up in a bun, which was almost her most striking feature if not for her large hazel-green eyes. \n        \u201cI have been looking for y\u2019all everywhere!\u201d Ellen spoke in a thick, Southern drawl that she had inherited from a childhood spent in Rome, Georgia.\n        \u201cYou will never guess who is upset about the new family. I swear, if they aren\u2019t Southern, then they just don\u2019t make the cut.\u201d Caroline rolled her eyes in Letitia\u2019s general direction.\n        Letitia blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s not that, Caroline. They just aren\u2019t the same class of people. I heard some of their slaves discussing time off with the white servants in the hallway yesterday. It is outrageous and\u2013\u201d\n        Ellen immediately cut her off, \u201cLetitia! We have been over this a thousand times. We got rid of slavery twenty-three years after you died. I swear, just when I think you have finally learned something and become a slightly better human being, you go and say something asinine.\u201d\n        Caroline interrupted, \"Look, you two. The times change. The people in the house change. We have to change with them. It is hard, but we have known hardship. Each of us in our own way.\u201d\n        Ellen looked down at Letitia. She resented Letitia\u2019s views, but she also knew of Letitia\u2019s strength. Letitia had lived through the first decades of the nation. She had given birth to nine children, with only seven surviving into adulthood. A stroke paralyzed her in later life. She held on for three years after that, managing her household from a chair the best she could until death took her.\n        Letitia looked back at Ellen and felt a sense of kinship with the Southern woman who was born in a different century than her own. Ellen, unlike Letitia, was highly educated and had progressive views about society. Letitia did not understand how Ellen could be so loving to everyone after living through World War I, but Letitia did try to learn from her. Even if Letitia didn\u2019t always say it, she admired Ellen\u2019s ability to adapt to the modern world. \n        Growing up at the height of the Civil War, Caroline had raised two children but lost her third in infancy, a death that still cut her to the quick. She had largely abandoned her life as an artist to care for her husband and support his career. But as a wife and mother, she had honed her leadership skills, and in death, she had transferred those skills to her role in this strange, ghostly trio.\n        All three of these women had died in the house and then haunted it in kind. Many men, women, and children had also died there, but it seemed that only women ever came back as apparitions. Three female servants from the late nineteenth century also haunted the house, but they occupied the basement rooms, which were formerly servants\u2019 quarters, and rarely spoke. \n        One enslaved woman named Sarah frequented the kitchens and often shared her take on their situation. She believed that the reason only women haunted the house was that women, as creators of life, were more tethered to this realm than men. Caroline did not know if she believed this reason, but it was the only one she had. \n        At that moment, the three women heard a loud bang from the grand staircase. They moved into the large hallway to see what had caused the commotion.\n        A toddling girl stood over a large palm-leaf plant now spilling out of its pot and into the hallway. She had a mess of blond hair pulled into a ponytail and was dressed in a thick woolen sweater, a red jumper, and knee-high white stockings. \n        Her mother promptly walked in, grabbing her gently with one hand while cradling a softly-cooing baby boy in the other.\n        \u201cSweetheart, be careful! Many things in this house are very old and very special,\u201d she said calmly.\n        \u201cLike Grandma?\u201d The little girl asked.\n        Her mother giggled and said, \u201cYes. Just like Grandma.\u201d As several servants began to pick up the pieces of broken ceramic scattered on the floor, the mother and her baby in arms, along with the little girl, walked up the staircase of their new home.\n        Letitia gasped, lightly touching the shoulders of the two other women. \u201cOh, a baby living here again! We haven\u2019t had a baby growing up in the house since when?\u201d\n        \u201cSince just after me,\u201d Caroline replied. \u201cGrover and Frances had Esther here, if you remember. And they came in not long after I passed away.\u201d \n        Letitia\u2019s face lit up, and all was right with the world. There was nothing on earth that Letitia loved more than children.\n        \u201cOk, ladies. Let\u2019s meet upstairs at nine PM sharp. We have a hard conversation ahead of us.\u201d Caroline said.\n        That evening, the three of them met on the second floor and began their walk down the hallway. They passed the man\u2019s office and, for the first time, caught a glimpse of him. He was around forty years old, with tan skin and a full head of brown hair that looked almost windswept. His eyes were deep blue and rested upon high-set cheekbones. He sat in silence at his large office desk, leaning forward with his hands clasped together. Two men in black suits sat across from him, muttering words about \u201cstrategic strikes\u201d and \u201cSoviet advancements.\u201d As always, the words that erupted from that office scared the women. But they knew that they had more important business to attend to at the moment.\n        The woman they had seen earlier was now in the master bedroom. The three spirits walked in and stood still. The woman was in a rocking chair, dressed in a long, white nightgown and humming softly to her sleeping baby boy. She let out a soft cry as if she had seen a ghost, or in this case, three. Letitia raised her hand in a stopping motion that had the inexplicable magical effect of silencing the living in her presence. \n        \u201cHello Jackie. You may find that you cannot speak for a few minutes. That is perfectly normal. This is an odd situation to be in. But rest assured. All will pass soon enough. You are now part of a very special club. We just happen to be three members that have lingered on in the clubhouse with some additional abilities. Let me introduce us. I am Letitia Tyler, wife of the 10th President, John Tyler. The woman to my left is Caroline Harrison, wife of the 23rd President, Benjamin Harrison. And to my right is Ellen Wilson, wife of the 28th President, Woodrow Wilson. The three of us are the only first ladies to have ever passed away while living here,\u201d Letitia explained. \n        Ellen stepped up next and spoke. \u201cWe can see the years ahead. Not many, but a few. In the past, we tried to tell the President of what is to come. His eyes and ears are always blind to us. But for some strange reason, his wife, at least in the first few days in the house, can do both. We cannot tell you details of your future. In the past, we have tried this, but it seems that then our message rings out in a muffled scream. Perhaps the Lord above will not allow mankind such flagrant control over our fates. But we have had success in offering a few words of warning, and we do have some things to ask of you. We know you must be quite tired of people asking things of you. This is the lot of women in this world, especially mothers. You will face so much adversity in the coming years. Your husband will be under the microscope. Love him unconditionally, as you always have. He is going to need it now, more than ever. Hug your children as much as you can, for life is so much shorter than it should be.\u201d\n        This statement brought the women to a moment of silence and brought a tear to each of their cheeks, for the children they had lost, both young and old. Jackie looked down at the child in her arms, no doubt thinking about the stillborn baby she had buried only a few short years ago.\n        But it was Caroline, the leader as always, who said what they all believed must be said. \n        She spoke plainly, \u201cYou will not understand this now, but one day soon, you will. Wear the pink Chanel suit, blood and all. Let them see. Show them what comes from the fires of hate. But show them, too, what emerges from the ashes. Because for the rest of your long life, Mrs. Kennedy, you won\u2019t just be seen as the mother of your children. You will be seen as the mother of this nation. And because of the radical love that you will give so freely in the darkest hours of your life and after, they will know that we do not break. We cannot. We are mothers.\u201d \n        The three women looked knowingly at each other and then back at Jackie. John-John started to cry, and Jackie looked down as she adjusted his pacifier. When she glanced back up, the ghostly women were gone, leaving behind a young mother who was nervous but confident that she would stay strong for whatever troubles lay ahead of her."}

I know I gave him a terrible fright and took a lot out of him. By haunting him, I may have changed him forever. But there was no other way. By the time Kevin moved in, I was really at my wit\u2019s end. I had been dead for more than six months and could no longer abide in the prison of my house.\n        My death had been uneventful. I was 92 years old and in good shape for a woman my age, if I do say so myself. My husband had died 12 years earlier. I\u2019d outlived my sister and all of my close friends. Some of my nieces and nephews would host me on holidays and occasionally stop over, but I knew that no one would be devastated by my loss. For more than a year, I\u2019d been feeling my body tell me that it was time to rest. So, when I didn\u2019t wake up, I felt more relief than grief. The grief came later, when I realized that I was trapped in a ghostly limbo.\n        By the time my body had been discovered by my neighbor and taken away, I\u2019d already tried absolutely everything I could conceive of to pass on to the next threshold. I meditated and tried to free my consciousness. When that didn\u2019t work, I combed through my many memories for some kind of unfinished business. When I couldn\u2019t think of any, I prayed to the God I\u2019d been out of touch with since my childhood. I got no reply.\n        Over the next few weeks, I experimented with my ghost form, which was invisible, immaterial, and, fortunately, pain-free. At first, it was exciting to see what my formless ghost body was capable of. I could walk through walls and closed doors. I could fly up through my ceiling and float into my attic. I practiced and got pretty good at throwing my energy at objects and knocking them over, but I couldn\u2019t really pick anything up and didn\u2019t have much control over any objects that I\u2019d try to move, so writing a note was out of the question.\n        No matter what I did, I was confined to my house. I\u2019d lived in that house for so many years and always felt safe and comfortable there. I\u2019d taken very good care of it and was happy that I\u2019d been able to die in my own colorful, familiar home rather than on some awful, sterile, white table at a hospital.\n        It was a terrifying realization: my cozy home had become a prison. I tried to squeeze my strange ghost form through the cracks under the door or into the ductwork in the attic. Regardless of how hard I tried, I always found myself back in my house, forced to forever knock about in the empty rooms.\n        My oldest niece, Jessica, began to pack up my belongings and prepare the house for sale. It was frustrating to fly right in front of Jessica and push against her with all of my energy, only to have her see and feel absolutely nothing. I did manage to knock a family picture off the wall just as she was passing by it. All she did was take the picture off the floor, smile at it, and put it in her bag. While she was leaving, I threw my ghost form against the door, working with all of my energy to push through. As always, I was stuck, fruitlessly attempting to escape the confines of the physical space that was once my beloved home.\n        On the day of the open house, organized by the cheerful little realtor that Jessica had hired to sell my home, I met Kevin. He was such a handsome young man. He couldn\u2019t have been more than 30. I noticed that he had paint under his fingernails.\n        I had been trying to make myself known all day, throwing my energy at every person who walked through the house, examining my bathroom, opening all of my closets, and testing the water in my kitchen sink. No one even batted an eye, except for Kevin. As I floated before him, he looked right at me, and he seemed to smile. The connection only lasted a moment, but I allowed myself to hope that it was real. I heard him give his information to the realtor. He mentioned that he was an artist and was looking for a home to use as a studio. He told her that something about the house inspired him.\n        A few weeks later, Kevin walked into my house carrying messy boxes full of oil paints and canvases. He helped the movers carry in a mattress, a couch and several large easels. After the movers left, he did not unpack his clothes or kitchen supplies. Instead, he immediately began taking unusual works of art out of long tubes and laying them out on the floor. They were odd, brightly colored paintings and I couldn\u2019t tell if they were meant to be abstractions or landscapes. I didn\u2019t want to look away from these utterly fascinating works. I floated above Kevin as he laid at least a dozen of these unusual and compelling pieces all over the floors of my house. I was entranced. Something about the colors, the textures, and the cluster of shapes felt oddly illuminated from within.\n        A few hours later, Kevin\u2019s phone buzzed, and he casually picked up his wallet and keys and effortlessly strolled out the front door to go out for dinner. After I watched in jealousy as he walked so easily through that front door out into the world, I returned to the artwork he had scattered all over my home.\n        I floated over the paintings Kevin had laid out on my tiled kitchen floor. They were all remarkable, but one, which he\u2019d laid next to a well-used painter\u2019s pallet, caught my attention. Like the others, it was composed of a series of brightly colored dots clustered around a vague form. However, this painting had a strange energy to it. The more time I spent with it, the more connected I felt to it. \n        As I moved my ghost form around the painting, the most extraordinary thing began to happen. This felt far more exciting than dying. In fact, for the first time since I\u2019d died, I felt almost alive. My energy was somehow becoming less structured and began merging into those bright colors on the canvas. I felt my essence stretching and spreading. There I was, still seeing the painting, but I was also somehow inside of the painting. I could stretch myself in new directions. I felt the sensation of power as these dots of paint and my ghostly form began to merge. In this thrilling moment of excitement, as I felt my immaterial self take shape into the paint, I knew what I had to do.\n        When Kevin returned that night, he turned on the light and gasped. All the paintings he had laid out on the floor had become barren white canvases. I could see the disbelief transform into terror in his eyes. He heard a dripping sound immediately behind him and turned around, trembling with fear. There I stood, in a fully visible form. I had become a liquid, dripping entity, fully shaped and shaded into the form of my former old woman body. My whole being was entirely composed of liquid oil paint.\n        Kevin screamed and attempted to run from me. I slowly walked after him, dripping fresh red splashes from my newly tangible form. Wherever he went, I followed, splattering paint against the walls. The paint seeped into my carpet and splashed against the tiles. I cornered Kevin in the kitchen and embraced him as my paint covered his clothes, dripped down his neck, and splattered into his hair. Kevin screamed, and paint dripped down his throat. I did not want to harm him, but I knew that I needed him.\n        Kevin was coughing, trembling, weeping, and drenched in the paint that I could now control. I felt myself slip into the beds of his fingernails and work my energy into his hands. He grabbed a paintbrush and slowly kneeled next to the now-blank canvas that lay on the kitchen floor, as if in a trance. I pushed my energy away from Kevin\u2019s body and into distinct pools of color onto his large, wood painter\u2019s pallet.\n        He began to work. I felt my energy flowing through his paintbrush and onto the canvas. \n        As dawn broke through the kitchen window, there it was: a completed masterpiece. Kevin had painted me into a gorgeous portrait of the woman I had once been. I\u2019d shown myself to him as I knew myself best, and he had depicted me in the fullness of my old age. On the canvas, I appeared as I had once been in life: vibrant, joyful, and fierce. As I felt the image fully incorporate my essence, something in my energy began to diminish. I felt peaceful, calm, and fully at rest. I eased into my new form. Through my painted eyes, I looked at Kevin with love as my existence slowly faded into the drying art.\n"}

He wanted nothing more than to live a quiet life away from the bustle of the world. But wars, plagues, societal upheaval, everything that could possibly get in the way of quiet isolation seemed to be following him. Eventually, he built a house out in the middle of nowhere in hopes of getting away. But the chaos found him there as well.\n        But, as he passed from this world, Oscar\u2019s plan went off without a hitch. He found himself not quite gone. He had taken some precautions. While the \u201cpeace\u201d of death was a fun idea, the idea of oblivion didn\u2019t appeal to him. He wanted quiet, not silence. So, while his house was being built, he made some deals with some very shady people. Dark rites, ancient texts, sinister deals, all ensured that even if the chaos of the world caught up to him, so long as that house stood, he\u2019d be there. \n        The intervening years had been nice to him. Oscar didn\u2019t know how other ghosts worked. He didn\u2019t even know if there were any other real ghosts out there in the world. But he wasn\u2019t like the works of fiction he had seen. He could touch things when he wished, but could also float through them on command. With this, he finally got a chance to actually read his extensive library of books. The fun ones too, not the ones that dealt exclusively with shadowy enigmas and eldritch horrors. Gardening was an interest that never quite hit him while he was alive, but he found it was a good way to keep himself grounded after death. \n        The natural cycles had a way of reflecting the passage of time in ways that comforted him after death. Without bowels to empty and a stomach to fill, it was easy to lose track of time. His afterlife was, in short, heaven. \n        At least until the tourists showed up. The first one was a hiker, who was exploring off the beaten trail. She had spotted something over the treeline after losing her way. Oscar, in his hubris, had built the house with a tower that peeked just over the treeline so that anyone could see it from a distance. But the hiker deemed it to be too far away, so she wrote it off as a lost cause and continued on. Later that week, she published a blog entry mentioning the old house she had spotted. \n        Just like that, others came to the house. They walked in Oscar\u2019s garden, broke his front door like they owned the place, picked through his books, and worst of all, disturbed his carefully maintained dust collection. It was too much. They had to go.\n\n        The invaders reached the house just as the sun was vanishing beyond the horizon. Two of them stayed outside to set up poles that caused the night to shine like the day. Oscar watched the interlopers work from his upstairs window. He glared down at them, judging each and every step they took on HIS land. \n        \u201cBah! They come here free as the wind, as though no one lives here. If they had a shred of respect, they would see my overflowing garden and see that this place is MINE!\u201d \n        Oscar soared through his house, angrily passing through wall after wall until he hovered in the middle of his first floor dining room. Other invaders scurried there with their wands of light that cut through the comforting gloom of his sanctuary. His disgust grew as he saw them pierce deeper into his abode, setting up more beacons of light that caused Oscar to feel insubstantial when he passed through them. Only in the dark did he feel whole, and they were ripping that away from him.\n        But he was not powerless. With a keening moan, he ascended back through the floors to the landing on the second floor. It appeared the interlopers were seeking to illuminate the first floor before spreading their influence any further. Oscar was determined to cut off their advance there. \n        Light blared up from the stairwell. Someone was coming. Oscar inhaled deeply, and although he had no lungs to fill, the house responded to him. The boards creaked inwards, the air grew deathly still, and the temperature inside plummeted. White puffs of air dissipated before the invaders mouths as they all suddenly found themselves holding their breath. \n        Oscar roared and the house exploded. Every window blew out, the doors flew off their hinges, and furniture rose off the ground to whirl about in the air. This chaos built and built until each of the intruders was thrown out the front door on a wall of wind. As the group gathered their wits about them the energy inside the house built to a peak. All that madness flowed out of the house in two words that echoed across the forest.\n        \u201cGET OUT!\u201d"}

His arms and legs were floppy from his stuffing losing its fluff. A little nub was all that remained of his pink tongue. The once shiny pink satin on his paws was now dull and worn. To say Kitty Kitty was well-loved would be an understatement. That is probably why Abby\u2019s spirit attached itself to Kitty Kitty when she died in a car crash in 1983 at the age of twenty.\n        Abby received Kitty Kitty on her third birthday. He was handmade by her grandma, which made Abby love him even more. She did everything with Kitty Kitty. They played together and watched cartoons together. He had a place at the table next to her, and she insisted that he get a small plate too. Kitty Kitty went everywhere with her, which became a problem when she started school. Abby always had a hot temper. So when she found out that her beloved friend could not go to school with her, she threw a tantrum for the ages. She flung herself to the ground and sobbed, begged and screamed. Red-faced with snot and tears smeared on her face, she faced one of the few defeats in the battles she chose with her parents. \n        After the accident, Abby was very confused. After all, there is not a new spirit orientation. She hovered in her dorm room watching her parents solemnly pack her belongings.\n        \u201cI\u2019m right here!\u201d she yelled, waving her hands wildly. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you hear me?\u201d\n        \u201cThis room sure is drafty,\u201d Abby\u2019s mother said. \u201cI feel a chill in here.\u201d \n        Her parents continued their packing in silence. Abby was certain that this must be a dream. She curled up on the bed and snuggled Kitty Kitty. Her spirit became engulfed by her best friend. She had a new vessel in the form of a stuffed cat. \n        Had Abby still possessed a stomach, it would have dropped when her mom swooped Kitty Kitty off the bed. She looked right in the black beaded eyes of the stuffed cat, and Abby felt as if she was getting one last goodbye with her mom. Her mom wiped away a tear and gently placed Kitty Kitty in the box. When she got home, she tucked the box away in the farthest corner of Abby\u2019s old closet. That is where Kitty Kitty and Abby stayed for the next four decades. \n        Three families came and went from the house Abby grew up in. The box was hidden away so well that it wasn\u2019t discovered until the Cooper family moved in. Shane and Molly Cooper had one daughter, Olive. She was four years old, and not unlike Abby. Her strong will and short temper gave Shane and Molly pause on whether they wanted to extend their family.\n        Molly climbed on a step stool in Abby\u2019s old closet. The dust was thick and created a cloud where she placed her hand to support herself. She stretched her arm far to dust in the furthest corner, and her hand brushed against the box. \n        \u201cWhat in the -\u201d Molly said, pulling the box down. \n        She set the box on the floor of Abby\u2019s room, now Olive\u2019s room, and opened the lid. The sunlight enveloped Abby. Olive rushed in and pushed her mom away so that she could examine the contents. She squealed with joy, and reached out to grab Kitty Kitty with her sticky grape jelly besmeared fingers. \n        Abby and her stuffed cat were rattled around. The sudden jolt, after what felt like an eternity of purgatory, unnerved her.\n        \u201cOlive, no, that\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Molly cried, trying to tug Kitty Kitty away by the arm. \n        Olive screamed a piercing, \u201cNOOOOOOOO!\u201d She hugged Kitty Kitty tighter. Abby was certain she would be squeezed to death if she wasn\u2019t already dead. \n        \u201cFine,\u201d Molly said. She did not have the energy to battle Olive for the fiftieth time today.\n        Olive squealed an equally piercing scream of delight.\n        \u201cI\u2019m in Hell, aren\u2019t I? That must be it,\u201d Abby said, though no one could hear her. \u201cUnbelievable!\u201d \n        Some believe that in the afterlife, you must learn the lessons you didn\u2019t learn on Earth. It was clear to Abby that Olive was going to teach her the lesson in patience that she never quite learned in life. \n        Kitty Kitty suffered great abuse at the hands of the Coopers. This did not set well with Abby. Olive carried the cat around by the ear. Her favorite game was tossing Kitty Kitty down the stairs. A close second was using him to play tug-of-war with their golden retriever, Max. After a long day of being bruised and battered, Kitty Kitty was smashed and drooled on as Olive\u2019s pillow. \n\tThe disrespect from the Coopers was just as torturous. They loved to discuss how vile Kitty Kitty was.\n\t\u201cOlive is going to get cat scratch fever or trichinosis from playing with it,\u201d Molly said.\n        \u201cRaw pork?\u201d Shane asked.\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d Molly asked.\n        \u201cTrichinosis. It comes from raw pork. Is Olive playing with raw pork?\u201d\n        Molly sighed. \u201cThe cat, Shane. Captain Mittens.\u201d.\n        Shane stroked his beard as he paused to think. \u201cOh, yeah. That thing has mange.\u201d\n        Abby listened in from the bottom stair step where Kitty Kitty was last flung. As a spirit, Abby was all energy, and the anger fueled her in a way that she didn\u2019t know was possible. She focused all of her pent-up fury and slammed herself against the couch where the Coopers sat. She surprised herself with this newfound ability, but not as much as she surprised the Coopers. They both jumped at the thump it made when it hit the couch. \n        \u201cMy god, is it possessed now too?\u201d Shane laughed. \n        They decided that it must be the dog violently shaking the toy, which was another of Abby\u2019s grievances. The act of force drained Abby, but she felt excitement about the potential havoc she could unleash. She immediately felt defeated when Olive grabbed KItty Kitty by the ear, and carried him off to bed. \n        Abby quickly picked up how to harness her energy. She had all the time in the world to practice. Her first matter of business was to mesmerize Max. Other than being aggressively shaken, she had grown to enjoy her time with Max. He reminded her of her own dog. Maybe she would get to see her on the other side one day. Animals are more sensitive to ghosts. At least that is what Abby always heard.\n\tOne evening, Shane and Molly sat on the couch watching TV. Olive sprawled out on the floor, eating cheese crackers and coloring in her coloring book. Max slept in his bed across from the fireplace, where Kitty Kitty rested against the red brick hearth.         \n        Abby attempted to get the dog\u2019s attention.\u201cMax! Come here boy. Look over here, buddy. Max! C\u2019mon Max!\u201d She became increasingly frustrated. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy?\u201d she asked in her best doggy voice. \n\tMax looked up and tilted his head.\n         \u201cIt\u2019s actually working,\u201d Abby whispered in shock. She let out a high-pitched whistle. Max stood up in his bed and whined.\n        \u201cWhat is it, bud?\u201d Shane asked. Max spent the next few minutes just staring at the fireplace. \n        Anytime Abby was in the room with Max, she coaxed him to stare at her. This new behavior was unsettling to the Coopers. Max was acting so strangely that they took him to the vet for a check-up. Max received a clean bill of health. The vet teased, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s looking at ghosts.\u201d\n        Abby decided it was time for advanced maneuvers. She just knew she could make Kitty Kitty move. She started off small. With much effort, she could move an arm or a leg or change the stitched-on smile into a frown. Molly could sense something was different with the stuffed cat. She just couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. \n        Abby\u2019s strength and endurance continued to grow. Soon she could physically slide Kitty Kitty across the floor. She started with short distances. She slid from the bottom of the stairs to the couch. Then, it was Olive\u2019s room to the hallway. One night, she was able to slide all the way down the hall and settle right in front of Molly and Shane\u2019s bedroom door, \n        The next morning, a groggy Shane rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and stumbled to the bedroom door. He tripped over Kitty Kitty. The opposing wall of the narrow hallway broke his fall. He hit the wall with a loud thud. Kitty Kitty lay at his feet. Shane picked him up and chucked him down the stairs. \n        Molly joined Shane in the kitchen, where he sat sipping his coffee. \u201cWhat was all the commotion this morning?\u201d She asked. \n        Shane pointed his finger at Kitty Kitty and shook it angrily. \u201cCaptain Mittens tried to kill me. I swear, Molly, I think that thing moves.\u201d\n        As Abby grew stronger, Shane and Molly grew more afraid of the incredible moving toy. Molly saged the house, so Abby moved to the table next to the abalone shell she used for the ceremony. \n        The Coopers had a string of bad luck. Olive fell at the playground and broke her arm. Molly had a blowout on the way to work. Shane was called for jury duty. Although Abby had nothing to do with it, they believed Kitty Kitty was cursed, thus the source of all their problems. \n        As the novelty wore off, Olive\u2019s interest in Kitty Kitty waned. Molly felt confident that she wouldn\u2019t miss the unholy toy. Especially if they got her the extravagant princess dollhouse she threw a tantrum for. Molly snuck Kitty Kitty outside, and threw him in the trashcan. \n        This was the ultimate action of disrespect, which made Abby furious. After dark, she managed to free the stuffed cat from the trashcan and entered the house through the dog door. Molly gasped when she came downstairs to see Max staring at Kitty Kitty in the middle of the living room floor. \n        The Coopers attempted to throw Kitty Kitty away three more times. They failed three times in their effort. In a last ditch effort, Shane searched the internet for how to get rid of a haunted doll. He found a paranormal museum in Vermont that happily took in wayward haunted dolls. Molly wrote a note, sealed Kitty Kitty in a box, and shipped him off to his new home. \n        For two years, Kitty Kitty sat in a lit glass case. Visitors had a wide range of reactions to the exhibit. Some covered their eyes in fear. Others laughed at the absurdity of a cursed stuffed cat. Perhaps the most annoying were the ones that took selfies with Kitty Kitty. \n        Abby patiently built up the negative energy directed towards her. She would need it if she was ever going to get back home.\n        One drizzly, unusually cold fall afternoon, Molly heard a knock on the door. A box with a tag that said \u201cFor Olive\u201d sat on the porch. Molly suspiciously looked around and brought the box in. She carefully cut the tape with a pair of scissors. Molly opened the flaps. She stood paralyzed for a minute. One foot behind the other, she backed away slowly. She raised her hands to her mouth and released a terrified shriek. \n"}

You were there, what did you see?\u201d\n        The courier bowed, closed her eyes in remembrance, and began. \u201cThe site is in one of the protected valleys in the Malborn range of mountains, inaccessible save by drake, other means of flight, or directed teleportation. There\u2019s a small but deep lake at the southern end of the valley, and the ruins occupy most of the northern end. To my eye, the ruins seemed similar in layout to the temples of the Arkhaten people, but spread out across a larger area.\u201d She paused, her eyes still closed. \u201cI presume this level of detail is sufficient?\u201d\n        Kissen chuckled. \u201cSo far, so good. I did ask you if you\u2019d seen anything, and honestly, even the smallest detail might be important. Please continue?\u201d\n        \u201cThe archaeological mages have set up camp between the lake and the ruins, using a grid formation common to our Empire. Mage Zolen is in charge, and he is a stickler for protocol. However, the camp appeared hastily constructed; rumor in the camp was that the site was very far down on Zolen\u2019s list of priorities, but that an incident on the longest day of the year caused him to focus more on this specific ruin.\u201d\n\t\u201cMy apologies for interrupting, but did rumor say anything about the incident?\u201d\n\t\u201cI heard one person mention a pillar of light, and another noted that the primary and secondary suns would have been directly over the ruin on the longest day. They were quieted by more senior mages before I could hear more.\u201d The courier tilted her head, and continued. \u201cFrom an aerial view, the ruin had many intact roofs, though the center was open to the sky, as with most Arkhaten ruins.\u201d\n        \u201cThough I presume you didn\u2019t see the object while flying?\u201d They tapped the pages of the report, frowning thoughtfully.\n        \u201cNo, Scholar Kissen,\u201d the courier replied. \u201cMage Zolen had set up a tent over the center, and did not explain himself to me.\u201d\n        Kissen stood up from behind their simple desk and began pacing. \u201cFool. Anyone with half a working brain would immediately suspect something unusual. Spies for the Consortium of Gold would have noticed the sudden shift in personnel, and if the Valteran Federation doesn\u2019t have informants inside the Mages Collegium, I\u2019ll eat my shoes.\u201d\n        The courier chuckled, and said, \u201cSadly, your shoes must remain uneaten. I know of at least three informants, and my resources are not so vast.\u201d She opened her eyes briefly, winking at Kissen, who laughed.\n        \u201cPlease, continue. The report mentions only an object, and gives very little detail aside from that.\u201d Kissen began to relax, settling into a less formal mode.\n        \u201cScholar Kissen, not all couriers for our Empire are spies,\u201d she said tartly as she closed her eyes again.\n        \u201cBut I know you are, Aerie, because we trained together. Never mind that we\u2019ve been on and off bed partners for years now.\u201d\n        The courier laughed. \u201cWell, yes. But Zolen was actually being good for once about his security. He\u2019d set up wards around the camp and the ruins themselves. He\u2019d even borrowed a trick from the Scryers\u2019 Guild, and used a defensive illusion ward I\u2019ve only seen one other time. From the outside, it looks like the tent is simply protecting a shattered crystal obelisk.\u201d\n        \u201cHm, just like all the other Arkhaten temples.\u201d Kissen began rubbing their temples as they paced back and forth behind their desk. \u201cThe real problem is that Zolen using all that security for once is just another sign to any spies or informants in the camp that he\u2019s actually found something of interest. I\u2019d try to shake sense into him if he were here.\u201d\n        \u201cI heard that Sergeant Callis tried reasoning with Zolen along those same lines, but the mage brushed off the sergeant\u2019s concerns. The argument I specifically overheard involved the isolation of the site, the restrictions on travel to and from the site, and the fact that all his workers had been verified by the Mages\u2019 Collegium before being transported to the ruin.\u201d\n        \u201cMaybe I should try selling fertile farmland in the Mist Swamps to Zolen when he gets back, since he\u2019s so trusting.\u201d\n        Aerie laughed at that, opening her eyes to flash Kissen an innocent look. \u201cI might have overheard Sergeant Callis making a very similar statement.\u201d\n        Kissen grinned. \u201cZolen\u2019s an excellent archaeologist and mage, but he\u2019s miserable about anything involving cloak and shadow operations. And I presume that Sergeant Callis is the one who penned the report? It has a certain style you usually see from security personnel.\u201d\n        The courier closed her eyes again, and exhaled slowly. \u201cThe sergeant handed the courier pouch to me directly, and the seal matches his. Whether he wrote it himself, or had a scribe do so, I cannot say for sure. But based on our records, he has enough education to have written it himself. And the degree of his loyalty is known to a precise measure; his family are well-positioned and well treated, leaving little to no room for discontent.\u201d\n        \u201cBless the Emperor for realizing that treating people well actually makes them more invested in supporting you,\u201d Kissen said with some heat. \u201cI know we all remember the last Emperor and his particular difficulties.\u201d They exhaled to calm themself down, and resumed pacing. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d\n        Aerie cleared her throat, and said carefully, \u201cI was only there for a day, but it did look like most of the personnel on site were of a similar mindset to Zolen. Curious to a fault, excited about the discovery, and perhaps a bit less discreet than one might want.\u201d She smiled, eyes still closed. \u201cI used that to my advantage. I gave the impression that I was a naive girl, unaccustomed to the grand works of the Arkhaten, and one of Zolen\u2019s associates appeared to fall for the ruse. Mage Myssa gave me a grand tour of the ruins, noting how well-preserved this one was considering the Arkhaten disappeared a thousand years ago, and how they were making great strides in understanding the language.\u201d\n        \u201cMyssa?\u201d Kissen said with some startlement. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the top experts in the petroglyphs of the Arkhaten, but she never leaves her home. Well, I suppose that\u2019s no longer true.\u201d\n        \u201cIndeed. She spent part of her time complaining that they couldn\u2019t bring her bed, and that the wheeled chair Zolen did get for her was inadequate to her needs. From what I saw, though, she had no trouble navigating the camp or the ruins.\u201d\n        \u201cI understand her frustration; her chair is a marvel of magical engineering, and I\u2019m sure only something custom-built to her specifications would suffice as a replacement.\u201d Kissen sighed again. \u201cThis just gets more and more troublesome the more you tell me. I\u2019ll have to ask the Office of the Cloak what they\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s a good thing there hasn\u2019t been a war in a few generations, but surely some of the other great powers beyond the Consortium and Federation have taken notice.\u201d\n        Aerie coughed, and pulled a scroll tube out of a pocket of her cloak. \u201cThe Office sends its regards, Scholar Kissen, and sent this in anticipation of your request.\u201d\n        \u201cTell me again how couriers aren\u2019t spies?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, you know. I know people who know people.\u201d\n        Laughing, Kissen took the tube and set it on their desk. \u201cI\u2019ll get to that information after you\u2019re finished reporting. Was Mage Myssa indiscreet enough to actually get you inside the central tent?\u201d\n        \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say indiscreet. In a moment of privacy, she let me know she saw through my ruse, and used a code phrase that signaled her affiliation with a certain Office you and I both trained with. I responded in kind. She then showed me what the tent concealed, well after hours, and with Sergeant Callis\u2019 full knowledge and consent.\u201d\n        \u201cHm. I do want to know, but at the same time I must express a bit of relief. It seems the Cloak is protecting Zolen from his own idealism.\u201d\n        \u201cIndeed. It\u2019s why I was assigned as a courier. Well, I requested the position when I knew you\u2019d be receiving the information.\u201d\n        Kissen paused, and leaned their hip against their desk. \u201cIt has been a while since we\u2019ve dallied, yes. But, first things first. What did you observe?\u201d\n        Aerie grinned momentarily, then sobered. \u201cIt\u2019s intact. The obelisk is as clear as water, save for the inscriptions of the Arkhaten on all four sides. It glows with a faint light, like that of the primary and secondary suns mixed. The radiance is steady, neither waxing nor waning with the passage of time. And it hums, though so quietly that you can only hear it in the dead of night, when the camp is still.\u201d\n        \u201cOh gods preserve me. Nobody\u2019s touched it, have they?\u201d\n        \u201cZolen once attempted to, according to Myssa, but she restrained him. She cited your research on the works of the Arkhaten.\u201d\n        \u201cIf my research is correct, he\u2019d have been incinerated on the spot. Of course, for all I know, he might have disappeared just like the Arkhaten did.\u201d Kissen groaned a bit. \u201cThat ruin is going to be nothing but trouble. We\u2019ll have to open it to the Consortium and the Federation soon, so they don\u2019t accuse us of trying to start another war. Or at least, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to tell the Emperor, and pray she\u2019s reasonable about the whole cursed situation.\u201d\n        \u201cWould she not be? Even I, a lowly courier, can see the potential political trouble surrounding this discovery.\u201d\n        \u201cHa. Lowly courier, my left foot.\u201d Kissen resumed pacing. \u201cI can count the number of people as well-connected as you on one hand, and I\u2019m including myself among them. Truly, though, what do you think?\u201d\n        \u201cHm,\u201d Aerie thought for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. Whether from the magic, the knowledge, a mix of both, or something else. The hair on the back of my neck stood up the whole time I was in that tent. This is going to cause a lot of waves when it comes out. People still think of the Arkhaten as gods, and you know how people feel about the gods.\u201d\n        Kissen sighed and shook their head too. \u201cI know, but the tundra cat\u2019s out of the bag at this point. The best we can do is to ride the waves. Gods. I should go and tell the Emperor. Join me?\u201d\n        \u201cMy aunt might not want to see me. I didn\u2019t exactly get her approval before disappearing and joining the Cloak, then masquerading as a courier.\u201d\n        \u201cBah. She can be sour another time. Plus, I know a few things about her sordid past, and she has no room to disapprove of you.\u201d Kissen grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s go tell Aslynn together, I\u2019ll protect you from her irritation, and afterward I\u2019ll treat you to dinner at that restaurant you favor.\u201d\n        \u201cDeal.\u201d\n"}

As a bonus, there is a brilliant study. This is going to be a great job for me. It\u2019s my first day and it\u2019s going to storm today, but no big deal. It is not like I have to actually try and light the lantern. Unlike in past times, it\u2019s all electrical now. I\u2019ll turn it on before I explore my living quarters more. \n        The study is amazing. There are worn leather chairs, a gas fireplace, and shelves full of books. Generations of keepers have added to the collection as there is not much to do here when you are not keeping watch. Now with cable and the internet, one can watch movies, but still, reading is always good. One can always go into town during the day, it is only about five miles away. Near enough to get necessities, yet far enough to have some solitude.\n        I scan the bookcases looking for something to read. As I look over the shelves, I discover a dark wooden box with an anchor carved into it.  I take it off the shelf. It\u2019s heavier than I expected it to be. I try to open it, but it\u2019s locked. I look over the box, there is a keyhole in the front. I wonder where the key is. I look on the shelf, but I see nothing.\n        Suddenly, the room starts to spin. Colors swirl around me. As the room comes into focus, I notice there are candles and lanterns instead of electrical lights. There is a woman covered in one of the chairs with a man sitting beside her, stroking her hair. He looks concerned. I cough, and move closer, but neither notice me. It seems that they can\u2019t see me.\n        I hear the man speak, \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry, Rose. I didn\u2019t know I would be out to sea for so long. We got lost, and then we had to make port to get more supplies and repair the ship. I sent a letter to you, but it obviously didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n        \u201cBernard, don\u2019t worry. This is the life of the sea. We both knew the risks when you left. My falling ill has nothing to do with your being away. I lit a candle in the window every night for you to come home, and you have. That is all I wanted. It is just bad luck that I caught such an illness. Promise me that you will continue to live your life even when I\u2019m gone. The life of a lighthouse keeper is a good one. You don\u2019t have to spend your life on the dangerous seas anymore. I love you. And if there is anything after this life, I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d\n        As the man heard this he tries to speak but only sobs come. The room spins again, and this time I see the man take the white taper candle out of the brass candleholder so that he can place the holder into the box that I was holding moments ago. Still crying, he takes a key, locks it, and then places it on the shelf. He then goes to the desk and opens the bottom drawer. Emptying the contents, he removes a piece of wood and places the key inside a secret compartment. He puts everything back in, and then shuts the drawer. \n        The room spins again, and I am on the floor. Everything is as I remember it. My head hurts. I reach up and there is a bump and small cut above my eye, and it is bleeding. I must have fallen and hit my head.  The box is on the floor beside me. I pick it up and walk to the desk. I take some tissue and put it against the cut. After sitting down in the desk chair, I feel woozy and pick up the phone to call the town doctor. As I sit there, I decide to open the bottom right-hand drawer. I empty it and feel around the bottom. Eventually, I find a groove in the wood.  I take a letter opener and work it into the groove until a panel opens. There is a key.\n        I pick up the key and then try to open the box with it. The box opens. Inside, there is a brass candleholder, and a white taper candle. I don\u2019t know what to think. There is a knocking at the door, and I go let the doctor in. I tell them the story, and they do not seem surprised. We walk together into the study, and I sit so they can examine me.  They suggest that I light the candle. As I do, the lights blur around me and I see two people happily dancing together.\n        The voice of Rose says, \u201cI told you that I would wait for you if I could.\u201d  The couple blurs into the light, and I hear the doctor asking me if it hurts when they touch my head.

Instead, they just wink at me and say, \u201cWould that we all find someone worthy of lighting a candle to guide the way home.\u201d "}

He stood in the conservation lab at Sierra Nevada University, where he had headed the archaeology department for nearly thirty years. Box after box of his father\u2019s incredible collection of Indigenous artifacts was being delivered to the archaeology department\u2019s lab, and Frank would be overseeing the analysis of the entire collection. Today, he was finally fulfilling his lifelong dream and, even more importantly, his father\u2019s legacy.\n        Frank\u2019s father, Professor William Carleton, had headed the same department for the bulk of his professional life. Both Frank and his father came from several generations of professors of anthropology and archaeology, going all the way back to Frank\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Jack Carleton, who had accompanied Edward A. Ayrton, the great Egyptologist, on his digs in the Valley of the Kings in the early 1900s. But for at least the last hundred years or so, the Carleton family had focused their academic endeavors on studying the Indigenous material cultures of the American Southwest. \n        Frank and his father knew of the abysmal reputation that anthropologists and archaeologists carried among the Native peoples of the Southwestern region. For centuries, these men of science insulted Indigenous religion with their theories, took Indigenous artifacts without permission, bullied Indigenous elders into giving over their sacred stories, and even assaulted Indigenous women from time to time. Starting with Frank\u2019s father in the 1960s and continuing when Frank took over the department, the Carletons sought to change this dynamic, at least where Sierra Nevada University was concerned.                         They created an oversight board for each tribal group that the university worked with to oversee all research projects involving their people. Each researcher had to go through a step-by-step vetting process both before, during, and after their project to work with Indigenous groups. The end result was the most ethically stringent regulations for researching Native American civilizations at any university in the world. \n        For Frank and his father, their specific research interest related to the Anaasho people. The Anaasho lived west of Flagstaff, Arizona, in the heart of Canyon Diablo. The name Anaasho came from the root word in their language, meaning \u201cfalling star.\u201d This name was appropriate given that their tribal homeland was only a few miles north of the Barringer meteor crater.\n        A one hundred and fifty-foot-wide meteor collided with the earth around 50,000 years ago, marking the Arizona desert like a smallpox scar. At this time in world history, anthropologists claimed that only giant sloths and mammoths roamed the region. The Anaasho and other Native peoples in the area disagreed with scientists on this matter. They argued that their people were here when the meteor fell to the earth. Most scholars dismissed these claims as myths and legends.\n        The Navajo and Hopi people had largely stayed away from the huge crater in the desert, arguing that it contained a dangerous level of spiritual power. But the Anaasho had long ago embraced this space. They held sacred ceremonies in its depths up until the early nineteenth  century, when miners and developers chased them away. They also incorporated remnants of the meteor into objects used in both daily life and in their religious rituals.\n        Many of these objects had been collected by Frank\u2019s father over the years. Some had been found in his early digs around the crater in the 1960s. Others had been gifted to him by tribal members as he built relationships with them while collecting their oral histories for his various research projects. A few of them had been donated by fellow archaeologists.\n        By the time William Carleton passed away in 2022, this collection contained around 75 different Anaasho artifacts. Dozens of these artifacts were water vessels, a critical object in Anaasho society.         The Anaasho people were semi-nomadic, living in Canyon Diablo in the winter months when the temperatures were mild and then traveling to Mount Humphrey\u2019s peak in the summer months. As the highest point in Arizona, Mount Humphrey provided a place to conduct summer rituals and gather special herbs for making medicine. The water vessels, made with clay from the canyon, were all delicately decorated with a black iron paint derived from ground bits of meteor fragments likely gathered from various points across the blast zone of the crater. \n        Other objects in the collection incorporated the meteor fragments in more practical ways, such as spear and ax heads made with meteoric iron. Frank had even been given a polished meteorite stone by his father as a boy, carved into a face, likely a child\u2019s toy from long ago.\n        All of these objects were now being unboxed and placed on the counters of the conservation lab by a troop of graduate students wearing white fabric gloves. Frank had inherited the collection over a year ago when his father passed away from pancreatic cancer. At that time, Frank decided he wanted to use some of the latest tools in his lab to analyze the meteorite materials in the pieces.The Anaasho council had loved William Carleton. His research respected the stories of the elders and broke down many misconceptions about their belief systems among the wider American public. This was the reason why the tribe was allowing Frank to keep the collection at the university rather than requesting that it be returned to the tribal council for placement in their museum. Frank felt honored by this gesture and made sure to follow all the necessary steps of his father\u2019s regulatory system with the tribal council. Every single object had to be approved before the entire collection could be released to the university lab. \n        It took eleven months, but finally the day had arrived.\n        One of Frank\u2019s students, Tom, opened up the last of the boxes, which contained Frank\u2019s favorite piece and the one that excited him the most today. His dad had referred to it as \u201cthe rock in the sphere.\u201d The ceramic sphere resembled a round seed holder, but it lacked the seed hole at the top. Typically, these round pots with holes would have been used to save squash and corn seeds from the most successful plants for the following spring plantings. But this pot contained something else. Something rolled inside of it in a clunking manner and called to Frank like a tell-tale heart.\n        The object had been found by his father\u2019s uncle, James Carleton, who had accompanied William on a dig near Humphreys Peak in the 1970s. Both of the men found the item very strange and had taken it to the tribal elders that they knew down in Canyon Diablo. The elders carefully handled the sphere and said it was definitely Anaasho, pointing out the symbology and black meteorite paint that marked the vessel. But the elders said the images on the object contained warnings; owls, a common symbol of death in Anaasho culture, danced across the top of its white surface, appearing to avoid shooting stars that exploded around them. A large snake eating its own tail wrapped around the sphere like a noose. When the elders realized this, they handed the object to William and refused to touch it anymore. But at that point, William could not even return it to the original site. The National Park system was planning to build a huge visitor\u2019s center directly over the site the following year for the Barringer meteor crater once the dig had been completed. The tribal council told him to take the object and add it to his collection, with the promise to keep the sphere sealed. \n        Frank had planned on keeping that promise, but then he found out more about what was inside the sphere. When he inherited the collection\u2019s archival paperwork, he came upon the papers for his favorite object and saw that his dad had run the ceramic sphere through a special scanner in the lab decades ago. The scanner showed that whatever was inside was highly metallic, a common trait of a meteorite fragment, as was expected. However, the rock also contained something organic. Frank could not believe his eyes when he read the report. \n        He knew his father would never betray the elders\u2019 request that the sphere be left intact, but at what cost?\n        Frank theorized that the organic material inside the meteor fragment could be a piece of bone from the ancestors of the Anaasho people. If his theory was correct, this artifact could prove the Anaasho oral histories of their people\u2019s existence in northern Arizona at the time of the meteor impact true. Even more exciting for Frank, this information would completely upend the presently accepted timeline of human migration into the American Southwest. With all of this knowledge at stake, surely the elders would forgive him if he opened up this one artifact.\n        Frank waited for the last graduate students to leave the lab for the evening and carefully shut the door behind them. He did not want any prying eyes to report back to the dean that he was improperly handling pieces in the new collection, even if they had belonged to his father. He turned on the lamp behind the ceramic sphere on the counter. It was still just as beautiful as the day his father brought it home from the field. White and shining, the sphere was smooth and barely porous, hand-formed from the unique matte clay that dotted the muddy beds around the creek that flowed through Canyon Diablo. Frank\u2019s father had dated the sphere as being around 10,000 years old. The high-altitude, arid desert climate had preserved the ceramic pot in near-museum-quality condition. \n        Frank took a small laser cutter and slowly cut around the top of the sphere. He made sure to use the measuring tool so that he could easily fit the cut-out back into the sphere to allow the pieces to be placed together with minimal damage afterwards. Once the cut was complete, he lifted the sphere in one hand, allowing the piece to fall softly into his palm. He immediately smelled the faint, dusty scent of the upper Arizona plateau wafting from inside, along with something else\u2014something metallic, like pennies or blood. With the loose ceramic piece, the object inside also came out. Frank held his breath. \n        The object was just as he expected. A smooth, onyx meteor fragment pockmarked from its journey across an unfathomably vast universe sat in the palm of Frank\u2019s hand. Frank placed the ceramic piece next to the sphere on the table and examined the meteorite closely, rolling it over in his hand and feeling its cool, affirming weight. When he turned the rock over, he noticed an aberration and felt a ripple of excitement rush through him. It was a bone. It had to be. Fossilized and aged, as all bones were, it peeked from the black stone in a shock of gray. Frank rushed the rock with shaking hands to his microscope to get a better look.\n        He peered into the microscope and then stepped back in disbelief. He had seen every fossilized human and animal bone under the sun over the years. But he had never seen anything like this bone. It was not an animal bone. It was not a human bone. It was something else entirely. The osteocytes embedded within the bone matrix had an entirely different pattern of arrangement, interconnecting into honeycombed chambers in near-perfect symmetry. He took a step away from the microscope, picking up the object and holding it out in mesmerized wonder. And then it happened. \n        His graduate student Tom opened the door to the lab and said, \u201cProfessor Carleton, I thought you went home for the evening.\u201d\n        Frank jumped, and in a fraction of a second, his hand slipped, and the world was changed. The object fell to the counter and cracked open right where the bone peaked out. A small puff of dust, thousands of years old, rose up and wafted into the air. Frank and Tom gasped at the sound of the crack, and that was that.\n        The Carleton virus, as it came to be known, ripped through the world population faster than smallpox had decimated the Native Americans in North America in 1492. Modern medicine was a massive help, but global travel and political disagreements about borders and quarantine rules allowed the virus to spread across the planet like lightning. Within a year, nearly a third of the global population had died from the disease, and societal collapse had already begun in most developed nations. \n        Scientists soon realized that Southwestern Indigenous populations such as the Navajo, the Hopi, and the Anaasho in particular were largely unaffected by the virus.  Ironically, their blood and their antibodies ultimately provided the blueprints for the vaccine. The highest amounts of these antibodies were found in the elder populations of the Anaasho, usually those still living on the reservation. It was these elders, who still carried memories of forced assimilation, racial violence, and discrimination, that would line the streets in front of blood banks across the Southwest, giving of their bodies freely and lovingly to save the world.\n"}

We\u2019d seen images of the strange metallic structure that had crashed into our fourth-largest moon. It had been many generations since our people had traveled off planet. Our ancestors had been explorers of the stars, but the risks had been grave and the advantages sparse. We had abandoned exploration, but we still had the ancient wisdom.\n        The appearance of the mysterious craft reinvigorated the desire for off-planet ventures. It took us a full generation, but finally, we planned a mission and launched a group of brave young messengers to our moon to learn more about the odd, metallic craft.\n        When we learned that a mission had successfully retrieved the craft and returned with it to our village, all of my people shared a collective mind-thread of joy. We planned an unveiling ceremony. Everyone was frantic with questions. What could this craft mean? The messengers had confirmed that the craft was indeed a manufactured item and not an unusually shaped asteroid. It had flown, unmanned, from outside of our star system. No one had ever seen any piece of technology that originated from further away than our nearest solar system. Was this definitive proof that consciousness was not unique to our galactic system? Or, was this craft just a relic from an earlier iteration of our planet? We knew that our ancestors had sent many crafts into the voids of space many years ago. Could this be a primitive, ancient craft that somehow ventured beyond our star and then returned to its home?\n        When the messengers returned from their voyage, they placed the craft ceremoniously on the stone table in the heart of our village. I am the oldest living member of my village, so the youngsters asked me if I would do the honors of unveiling the craft at a ceremony. I accepted and was given the privilege to see the craft before the rest of the village.\n        In my many years of life, I'd seen so many remarkable technologies developed, first by my own generation and then by the many that followed after me. But this craft contained technologies I had never before encountered. In some ways, it felt archaic, as if it belonged in a time of my ancestors, not in our current world. The craft\u2019s construction was simplistic and unremarkable. However, there was a strange beauty to it.\n        I touched the craft with all three of my hands and felt a delightful chill of anticipation run through my nervous system. As I pressed down on the top of the bizarre craft, I realized that the lid could be lifted away. I carefully opened the central portal of the craft. That is where I found the most remarkable item I have ever seen \u2014 the golden disk.\n        The disk was thin, perfectly circular, with a small hole in the center. All along the top of the disk were strange and beautiful etchings. There was another circle, several rectangles, and a cluster of lines that together looked like a meteor shower. What did these engravings mean? Could they be a language? Could they be instructions? I had never before seen a thing of such profound beauty.\n        Awed, I stared at the disk until sunrise. I then prepared myself for the unveiling ceremony.\n        The entire village, young and old, had gathered to witness the reveal of the mysterious craft. I formally approached the stone table and stood before my people.\n        \u201cBeloved friends. What you will see before you is unlike anything you have ever seen before. I do not know what it means or where it is from. It will be left to you, the young, and the generations who follow you to discover the mysteries of this object. I do not know its origins or its meaning. But this I do know. This thing of beauty is not from our planet, nor any other planet that our people have inhabited. I believe, truly and finally, that we now know that we are not alone in this vast universe. Somewhere, somehow, another consciousness reaches out to us through the multitudes of stars and the epochs of time.\u201d \n        I paused. The minds of our whole village vibrated together, radiating with excitement. I then pulled the gold disk away from the craft and held it before my village. \u201cThis little work of art cries out, \u2018We exist. Come find us.\u2019 And we will!\u201d\n        A roar of joy echoed through our shared vibrations. My time was coming to an end, but this new age of curiosity and exploration was just beginning."}

Let\u2019s just get through this batch so we can move on,\u201d John says. \n\n\tA few hours later and both of them slammed their trays of mediocre food on the cheap lunch tables. The cafeteria was located only a few levels up in the facility, which meant that the heat from the generators still reached that deep. It was one of the few places where they didn\u2019t have to wear cold weather clothes, even while indoors. Which meant that it was by far the most crowded place in the facility. The pair had thankfully found a spot at a two-seater table, so they had some degree of privacy, but only after waiting a solid five minutes for it to be emptied of coworkers. \n\tJohn picked through his pile of watery beans. \n\t\u201cSo, wild sci-fi theories aside, what DO you think is up with the sphere?\u201d\n\t\u201cWell, it seems like it keeps sending out messages in a variety of ways. I think it's trying to find a specific format that works for us to understand what it\u2019s saying. That, or maybe it\u2019s trying to learn? I dunno, all I\u2019m getting paid for is recording the output,\u201d Jessica says through a crumbly dessert.\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of one of the most significant scientific discoveries in the history of our species, and you\u2019re worried about your pay?\u201d John asked.\n\t\u201cHey, we\u2019ve all gotta pay rent,\u201d Jessica said.\n\t\u201cYou quite literally don\u2019t, your lodgings are all covered as part of the contract,\u201d John said.\n\t\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna have to pay rent AFTER this is all over,\u201d Jessica said.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m getting enough money to buy my own place outright after this.

Anyway, what makes you think this is going to be such a huge scientific breakthrough? It\u2019s just a sphere,\u201d Jessica said. \n\t\u201cThat\u2019s extremely reductive. It\u2019s a sphere that\u2019s been sending magnetic fluctuations out across the entire globe every few weeks. The governments can only keep this a secret for so long before things start getting crazy, what will all the tech going haywire. It\u2019s also a sphere we can\u2019t directly interact with aside from the cables that it stuck into our computers. We have no idea what the heck this thing is, so I\u2019d say figuring that out would be a pretty massive breakthrough,\u201d John said.\n\t\u201cWell, if anything could be in there, that means there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s basically nothing as well,\u201d Jessica said.\n\t\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll have earned a lot of money from a wild goose chase, and you will have earned a middling amount of money from that same chase,\u201d John said.\n\tJessica stared at John for a beat before knocking his coffee into his lap. He leapt up with a shout, then ran to grab napkins. \n\t\u201cTeach you to be smug about pay differences\u2026\u201d Jessica mumbled.\n\t\n\tIn the sphere\u2019s chamber, the enigmatic orb had fallen mysteriously silent. John slapped his monitor in frustration.\n\t\u201cOf course, for absolutely no reason, the thing goes silent. Any readings on your end, Jess?\u201d John asked. \n\t\u201cMost of my monitors have nothing, but this one in the corner seems to be slowly loading something,\u201d Jessica said. \n\tJohn rode his office chair over to the monitor Jessica indicated. On it a loading bar, much like one he recently saw on a website, slowly filled. \n\t\u201cUh\u2026 have we seen this one before?\u201d John asked.\n\t\u201cNope. Do we\u2026 go on break until it\u2019s done?\u201d Jessica asked. \n\t\u201cFor once, I think we hold off. If this is unheard of, there\u2019s a good chance this could be a breakthrough,\u201d John said. \n\tAs the bar filled, the two became aware of a growing sound in the room. A droning that built until they could feel it in their bones. \n\t\u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna go ahead and call security. Just, uh, just in case,\u201d Jessica said.\n\tSuddenly, the bar jumped to full.\n\tBoth scientists tensed up as the screen went black. Then, an image slowly faded into being. It was their lunch table. With them at it. The point of view from the image appeared to be from the head level of someone standing next to their table. The image moved. Jessica\u2019s arm reached over and knocked John\u2019s coffee into his lap. But the movements were wrong, stilted, like they were being animated by a puppeteer. Once the slap stopped, the image twitched and started again. As the second repetition played, a single question mark faded onto the screen. \n\tThe two scientists shared a look. It was the first time the sphere had reached out to communicate with them. Any response could be interpreted in a variety of ways by the alien entity. Jessica decided it was best to simply say something.\n\t\u201cI did that because John here was being insufferable. It seemed funny at the time,\u201d Jessica said. \n\tThe screen went black. With a slithering noise, the cables detached from the computers and retracted into the sphere. Then, it simply vanished.\n"}

Dream job yes; dream apartment, well, it will do. The apartment is quaint, but small. Aside from the wardrobe, there is not much storage space, save for a small closet in the bedroom. My living room and office is a small alcove attached to the kitchen. They are separated only by an arch in the ceiling. The walls on one side are brick with dark wood windows. \n       Off to the end of the room is a door leading to the bedroom which has a closet. I wish the wardrobe were in the bedroom instead of the living room\/office, but alas it is not, and it is too big and heavy to even think about moving. \n       My furniture is in storage. I rented a furnished apartment for ease of a move that might be temporary in nature. Hopefully my position will renew in a year. If not, I will have another move, and it is so much easier not moving everything. I really just need to unpack my books, office supplies, and clothes, but it still feels tedious. I wish I had a magic wand. \n       I\u2019m starting to feel a bit hungry. I have done zero shopping so far. That joy will have to wait until tomorrow, I think. I\u2019ll explore the neighborhood then. In the meantime, pizza it is. Delivery is my best friend. Perhaps, I\u2019ll have some groceries delivered too. No, I really need to get out of the apartment and explore my new area. I\u2019ll unpack my books while I wait for the pizza. I don\u2019t have all my books as most went to storage with my other things. I just bought my favorites, and the ones I need for my class, and research.\n       Alas, there is only one small shelf, and there is not room for all my books on it. So, I\u2019ll put some in the bottom of the wardrobe. It could be worse, I tell myself. I get a pile and step one foot inside so I can put them against the back. My foot catches on something and I fall in. I hear a loud cracking sound as the back of the wardrobe opens up just a crack.\n       I feel my head just to make sure I have not bumped it. After all, these types of things don\u2019t happen in real life, do they? My head seems fine. I carefully get up and look at the bottom of the wardrobe. There is a very small wooden knob at the bottom, that is what I tripped on. It must have triggered the door. The entire back of the wardrobe is a door without any handles.I start to push the heavy door open.\n       Ugh, there is a knock on the door. It\u2019s the pizza. I can\u2019t believe I forgot that I ordered dinner. I rush to the door, and a really pleasant person hands me a large box and a bottle of soda. I thank them and shut the door. I\u2019m not hungry now, I want to see what is behind the door. I mean, I know it is not Narnia, but still I hope it is more exciting than a storage place for socks and scarfs. It must be at least as deep as the door is wide, which I think is about four feet. I didn\u2019t measure it, but from all appearances, it is a decent width. \n       I put the pizza on the counter and quickly return to the wardrobe. I step in and carefully push the door open. All I see is darkness. I take my phone out of my back pocket and turn the flashlight feature on. I shine the light around and see a switch next to the door. I flip the switch up and a wrought iron ceiling light softly illuminates the room. It is a small study.\n       This might be even better than Narnia, I think with glee. I walk inside. There is a large wooden desk with a worn leather chair on one side. Across from the desk is a wall of books placed carefully upon dark wood shelves. It is complete with a moving wooden ladder. Oh, my dreams are coming true. In the center of the room are two large dark brown leather chairs that have silver buttons along the seams with footrests and a table between them facing a stone fireplace. There are votive candles on the mantle.\n       I go over to the desk, and there is a letter on it. The envelope is beautiful. It is cream-colored and has a rough texture. Written in calligraphy with deep black ink, it says \u201cto the new occupant of apartment 212.\u201d I sit down on the chair, and turn the envelope over. It is sealed closed with red wax. The imprint on the wax is a stack of books. It is so pretty, I don\u2019t want to break the seal. I look on the desk, and there is a letter opener in a round wooden holder with pens and scissors. I take the letter opener out, and carefully open the envelope.\n       I take out the letter and unfold the thick, cream-colored page. I love the sound the paper makes as I begin to read it. Written in the same black calligraphy that was on the front of the envelope, it says: \u201cSince you found this room hidden behind the wardrobe, I can only hope that you are the whimsical sort of person who will appreciate my special spot. You see, I built this during the war to hide a husband and wife who were fleeing for their lives. When the war was over, they moved to a different country, but I stayed here in this apartment.\n       \u201cI corresponded with them for years. The first letter they sent me contained a large sum of money, which they told me was to build my dream study in the area that they hid. I could have moved the wardrobe and just put in a regular door, but the romantic part of me loved the idea of a secret study. I had many visitors during the years, but only showed this room to a select few. The person you are renting the apartment from is one of those people. \n       \u201cSasha and I agreed not to tell renters about this space, but to leave a letter should it be found. It was my hope that this way, the only people that will use this space, are people who will appreciate it. There are no guarantees in life, but there is hope.  Since you have found this space, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Worry not, this tale does not end badly for me. You see, with the rent money, I am following another dream of mine in my golden years. I\u2019m traveling the world. It gives me great pleasure to imagine someone else sitting by the fire enjoying my books. Please tell Sasha you found it. It will bring me much joy to know someone has found my treasure. Sasha knows how to reach me. Yours, Edward.\u201d\n       I feel a little flutter in my chest. This is absolutely magical. I go to the fireplace. It is gas, and it is very easy to turn on. I sink into one of the leather chairs, smiling. There is a table next to the chair with a small brass light upon it. As I turn it on, I notice there is a copy of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe underneath it. I pick the book up and open it. I'll call Joyce tomorrow. Tonight, I\u2019m reading. I begin the first sentence:\n        \u201cOnce, there were four children, whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.\u201d"}
{"example_id":"example_032","inputs":"Write about discovering a hidden room. The room should only be seen by the protagonist of the story. The protagonist should be the famous impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh. The story should occur at the time that Van Gogh was living with the painter Paul Gauguin in their shared studio home known as the Yellow House in Arles, France. The story should feature a lot of art history and visually describe several of Van Gogh's paintings in depth. The story should also describe the mental illness that Van Gogh was experiencing during this time. The story should reveal that this mental illness gave Van Gogh the ability to see the world around him as paintings. The story should end with Van Gogh painting Starry Night in the mental asylum. The story should be between 1800 to 1900 words.","targets":"        Vincent van Gogh took another drink of absinthe as he listened to Paul Gauguin drunkenly tell another story about his Paris escapades. It was nearly midnight, and while Vincent usually enjoyed Paul\u2019s dramatic tales of debauchery in the city, he really just wanted to sleep. He had spent the last twelve hours painting in their shared studio in the shared home that they lovingly called the Yellow House in Arles, France. His head throbbed from the smell of linseed oil, and his fingers felt raw from the last hours spent cleaning his brushes.\n        Paul poured himself another glass of absinthe and began the bit about the lady with the red dress on the Rue Saint-Denis. Vincent had heard the story before, and his eyes began to wander around his living room. It was sparsely decorated with a curved-back couch that his friend and fellow artist Paul now sat upon, a small coffee table he had picked up last month at a local carpenter\u2019s shop, and two elderly armchairs with burgundy upholstery. He picked at the thread-worn side of his chair and suddenly noticed a flash of light coming from his bedroom door.\n        Vincent had left the door shut this morning when he went to the kitchen for breakfast, as always. But now he saw that light was escaping from beneath the crack, even though the house was not yet equipped with electricity. What was even more odd was that the light seemed to carry a bit of color within it. Van Gogh assumed his eyes were growing tired and pushed his glass away.. He really should lessen his drinking. Paul was not the best influence in that regard. \n        Vincent awoke with a start. The room was pitch black. The grandfather clock that ticked like a heartbeat said it was nearly four in the morning. He must have dozed off during Paul\u2019s tedious story. Vincent stood up and stretched, rubbing his palms together for warmth as the chill of the night air reminded him that it was nearly October. He sleepily walked towards his bedroom, only to see that same strange prismatic light. He opened the wooden door, perhaps expecting a flickering candle left on his desk, but he could barely process what he saw next.\n        An array of colors confronted him, thick and viscous. The wood of his bed frame jutted forward at him in hues of yellow-brown. His red bedding was piled high with dabs of bold pigmentation, and his sheets and pillows were an off-color cream. The floorboards were warped into an offset shape and cracked with green shadows, and the walls glowed in a soothing blue that spoke to his soul. This room was not Vincent\u2019s perspective on his paintings. This room WAS his painting, or rather, a painting not yet realized. He screamed for Paul to come down and see.\n        Paul rushed into the room, asking Vincent if he was okay, likely expecting that he had yet again taken a drunken tumble or perhaps was having more dark thoughts. But when Vincent told him that the room had been transformed, Paul looked skeptical.\n        \u201cSo this room? Here, in front of me now? It looks like a painting to you. As in, you could see it as a future painting, right?\u201d Paul asked.\n        \u201cNo! It IS a painting. YOU are walking around in a real-life painting!\u201d Vincent yelled.\n        \u201cI am just going to assume that you woke up and had more absinthe in my absence,\u201d Paul snidely remarked. \u201cBut I am not going to question your methods. If you see a painting, then let me see it. Paint it!\u201d\n        Paul walked out of the room and came back with Vincent\u2019s easel, his bag of paints and brushes, and a small blank canvas. He lit several candles and told Vincent he was going back to bed and would see him later.\n        Initially, Vincent was annoyed at Paul for not seeing what was clear as day to him. But he decided that if Paul was indeed telling the truth, Vincent had to at least try to show him what he was seeing. He worked through sunrise and into the late morning. Paul got up around noon and came back to see the nearly finished painting. It was magnificent. \n        \u201cThis is phenomenal work, Vincent,\u201d Paul said, with some reluctance. He was happy to see his friend so engrossed in his artistic vision, but also a little jealous at the ease with which that vision seemed to appear before him.\n        \u201cYes, well, it is done. Perhaps now that I have painted it, the vision will leave me. If you don\u2019t mind, I am going to take a rest on the couch. I am exhausted but the idea of sleeping in a painting unnerves me,\u201d Vincent said.\n        Vincent threw himself on the couch, one leg falling off the side. His head barely had time to hit the cushion before he was in a deep sleep, the oil paint still wet on his shirt sleeves.\n        He awoke just after sunrise. He had slept the entire day and through the night. He smelled bacon frying in the kitchen and knew Paul must be cooking breakfast. He rubbed his eyes and sat up. Looking over towards his room, he saw that it remained the same. He groaned. Yes, it was beautiful. But also, very strange. Then, he looked at the table. \n        A variety of objects were strewn about its surface; a straw hat and soup pot from the previous evening's dinner sat next to a tureen. A vase of sunflowers freshly picked by Vincent yesterday sat at the center of the table, and a basket of oranges from the market was placed on the corner. Vincent gasped. The entire table and everything on it looked just as his bedroom did. The straw was smooth with brushstrokes. The sunflowers possessed petals rich with texture. And the basket looked almost alive, as if woven of beautiful tan earthworms warm from the dirt.\n        \u201cPaul! Paul! Canvases! I need canvases! It is happening again!\u201d Vincent yelled.\n        Paul rushed in wearing a kitchen apron and grabbed Vincent\u2019s supplies, still in his bedroom. Vincent went to work and began producing more paintings than he had in years. The visions continued, though for Vincent they were not visions at all, but rather glimpses into a new reality. Only these realities were like slivers into some other world that seemed to coexist right alongside this world, opening up just for him. In the weeks that followed, the realities spread to other people as well. Vincent painted the postman and even a young woman in town, who suddenly came alive with brushstrokes and color that made Vincent stop in the street and pay them handsomely to pose in his studio.\n        Paul continued his standard painting schedule, which was good, but certainly not at the same level of production as Vincent's. He also kept his jealousy to a minimum, reminding himself that Vincent was a sensitive soul who needed support.\n        Vincent still could not bring himself to sleep in his bedroom. He camped out on the couch every night. One morning, after an all-night painting session, Vincent woke up just as the sun started to rise. But it was not the light that woke him. It was a sickly, squelching sound, in his left ear. He stood up from the couch, and looked towards his bedroom door. The strange visions once contained to his bedroom and to the tabletop in the Yellow House were now spreading like spilled paint from underneath his door. But even worse, the sound! It was a syrupy, sticky sound that unnerved Vincent. He grabbed a rag from the fireplace and tried shoving it under the door frame, but the colors flowed under it as if the rag didn\u2019t exist at all. And the sound continued. Then, Vincent began to hear more sounds. A buzzy humming from the now-old fruit on the table, a flitting sound like insect wings coming from the wildflowers Paul had placed in the vase today, and a creaking sound like an old ship coming from the wooden table to the left and the bedroom floors to the right. Vincent screamed, cupping his left ear in his hand.\n        Paul ran down the stairs wearing only his nightshirt. \u201cVincent! What is wrong? What has happened?\u201d\n        \u201cCan you not hear it? It is incessant! It is deafening!\u201d Vincent replied.\n        \u201cI hear nothing!\u201d Paul said, looking at Vincent with wild eyes.\n        \u201cIt is my left ear! Is there paint inside of it? Do you see the paint in it?\u201d Vincent clawed at his ear in desperation.\n        \u201cStop!\u201d Paul yelled, but before he knew what was happening, Vincent grabbed the fruit paring knife from the coffee table and sliced off half of his left ear.\n        The next day, Paul packed up his things and left the Yellow House for Copenhagen to reunite with his wife and children. Before he left, he wrote to Theo Van Gogh, an art dealer in Paris and Vincent\u2019s brother, telling him about what had happened. Not long after that, Theo came to Arles only to find Vincent in a terrible state of health. He immediately committed Vincent to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in nearby Saint-Remy-de-Provence.\n        Vincent spent his first week in bed at the asylum in a state of deep depression. He had lost his dear friend, Paul. He had no idea what would become of the Yellow House he had worked so hard to make into a home and studio. He had disappointed his brother, no doubt. Worst of all, even though he had painted so much, he still felt like a failure. None of his paintings had sold anywhere. He had always been an oddity, but was now a lunatic as well.\n        One night, he awoke with a start. He pushed himself up by the elbows and looked out through the barred asylum windows, hoping to catch a glimpse of the moon. Paul and Theo could be seeing the same moon after all. Then he was struck deeply and suddenly by a thing of beauty, the likes of which he had never seen. \n        The moon nestled in the sky like a nursery room rocker, comforting and yellow, simple and happy. The town lay below, with tin roofs spattered with color and reflecting starlight back up at the night sky. A church steeple jutted out sharply but not menacingly, pointing towards the heavens as if to remind Vincent of the beauty above as well as below. A cypress tree loomed large to the left. It scared Vincent a bit, but its darkness was soft, and its blacks and browns whispered to Vincent that nothing lasts forever, not even pain. But oh, what a sky! The mountains met the stars, and the twinkles of light became pulsating pats of paint, like butter warm on freshly baked bread. The moon hummed in his ears, like his mother when she rocked him to sleep after a bad dream. And the starshine sang like the children\u2019s choir at Notre Dame on Christmas Day.\n        Vincent lay in the bed and began to tremble all over. He knew he would not sleep tonight. He also knew he would have many sleepless nights ahead. The beauty around him was so noisy\u2014a cacophony of wonder. He would paint with the rising of the sun."}

No, my so-called \u201ccrimes\u201d have always been about changing things for the better for the people of Silver City, with full awareness for how people might be affected. \n\tRob a bank? Only after closing, to ensure the guards are safely asleep and away from any possible harm, and I only go after the banks whose policies actively harm the community. Oh yes, and make sure they have enough money to spare. I won\u2019t target credit unions, since they\u2019re nonprofits and pool their members\u2019 money: that\u2019s just wrong.\n        But the last time I did that? Metaman showed up, and began blasting eye lasers at me with no care for anyone who may be inhabiting the buildings around the bank.\n        What about the time I tried to stop a business from distributing tainted food from an unsanitary factory? Food that would never go to the tables of the rich, and ultimately harm the most vulnerable? Even when I intervened with the utmost care for human life, Stupendous Gal destroyed most of the factory equipment in an effort to corner and apprehend me. Yes, it did reveal how corrupt that business was, but at the same time all those workers went weeks without pay, and none of the so-called heroes ever lifted a finger to help them. Meanwhile, I made anonymous donations to all the families; there\u2019s no sense in someone losing their apartment or home because a woman in spandex couldn\u2019t think through the consequences of her actions.\n        And then there was the time that I intervened to stop The Mentalist from mind controlling nearly half the city\u2019s adult population to elect him as mayor? The man was misogynistic to a fault, targeting only people he deemed as women, and his choice to make them fall in love with him as part of the process was truly villainous. \n\tBut when I acted to destroy the pendant he was using to amplify his powers? The Night Prowler interrupted our supposed \u201csuper villain battle\u201d to attempt to arrest me, solely because I took action during an \u201cEveryone Loves The Mentalist\u201d rally! I had managed to keep the stage free of the enthralled masses, but the intervention of that so-called hero shattered my force field and allowed the actual villain to surround himself with innocent victims! And then The Night Prowler had the unadulterated gall to suggest that my force field was only to protect The Mentalist because I was under his control!\n        I have lost count of the number of times I have informed both the city at large and these caped crusaders that I am non-binary, but the Justice Heroes seem incapable of looking past my physical features. Simply because I have two doctoral degrees, one in psychology and the other in robotics, Stupendous Gal had the audacity to remark on my \u201cdouble double Ds,\u201d as if that was some absurd sort of compliment! And all while she was pursuing me after I attempted to rebuild the LGBTQIA center. One of her compatriots, Boy Rocket, destroyed it while apprehending an actual villain!\n        Pardon me, I seem to have drifted into a rant. My supposed villainy is a topic that causes me to shrug and move on with my life, but disregarding my identity even with repeated requests for consideration and respect? That is more than enough to make my blood boil.\n        In any case, I state that I have done more good for the marginalized of Silver City than any of the Justice Heroes. So what if my methods are unorthodox? The law bends to the whims of the rich and powerful, leaving the poor, the less fortunate, and the underserved with no recourse or means to tip the scales in their favor. \n\tWhen the Ultra Dynamic Corporation built a facility on the edge of the city, they bribed a number of city officials to look the other way when they used substandard materials that put the workers\u2019 lives at risk. When the Silver City Bank and Trust advertised mortgages to the needy and the desperate, they certainly did not alert those very same people to their predatory lending policies. And when William Banner used his financial influence to buy out a number of local shops to replace them with high-end grocery stores, he spent nearly as much on public relations to assure the people of those neighborhoods that this would bring needed prosperity to the area, all while failing to deliver actual assistance to people whose livelihoods had disappeared with the stroke of a pen.\n        I would note that Mr. Banner\u2019s jawline bears an uncanny resemblance to that of The Night Prowler. Should the resemblance go further, I might have serious questions about his fitness to effect positive change in the world in either suit he might wear.\n\tAnd yet, before I ever started on this career path to so-called villainy, every attempt I made to do good for the people was thwarted at every turn. I offered my intellect, my funds, my time, and even my passion to those in charge, hoping to make things better for everyone. I recognized that I came from a place of privilege, as very few are able to afford degrees in higher education. \n        But it simply didn\u2019t matter to the people in power. I suspect most of my suggestions were simply ignored, or perhaps even mocked, as they highlighted the places where Silver City was failing its citizens. And this shining example of a place where heroes and civilians worked together to make the city and the world a safer place, well, any tarnish on the image was not to be tolerated. \n        Eventually, I went underground, figuratively and literally. My initial attempts to right particular wrongs were mildly successful, though admittedly the inertia of bureaucracy was quite difficult to overcome. I employed an acquaintance of mine, one with excellent computer skills, to intrude upon the computer systems of various companies and make certain changes that would alleviate a substantial amount of debt and other harmful impacts on a number of people in the city. It was not as if those companies needed the money, and those records were so spotless that short of a time-consuming paper audit, there was no way to reinstate what had been removed.\n        No, I will not name my acquaintance. Said individual is still at liberty and rests safe in the arms of anonymity.\n        And even then, it was not enough. The rich kept getting richer on the backs of the economically disadvantaged, the politicians made a show of passing laws that ultimately benefited only them, and the police enforced laws far more often around property than people.\n\tDo you know the statistics on domestic assault as compared to graffiti, for example? A few shelters for the survivors of domestic assault would cost a pittance of the city\u2019s annual budget, but instead Silver City funds beautification projects that have little to do with actual beauty and more to do with property values.\n        Because in the end, it is all about the image of the city, whether in terms of the visual characteristics of any given neighborhood, or the appeal of people considered conventionally attractive. How many times has Metaman featured in your publication\u2019s \u201cTen Most Beautiful People\u201d list? Or Stupendous Gal? \n        If I could order the world to my satisfaction? Hah. Metaman would be using those eye lasers of his for constructive work, perhaps in a literal sense. The Night Prowler would be out patrolling the streets and providing protective services to every person who felt unsafe at night due to some facet of their identity. Stupendous Gal would utilize her strength and flight abilities to rescue people from burning buildings, perhaps. \n\tAnd all of them would perhaps take some of that boundless energy they seem to have for fighting \u201cthe forces of evil\u201d and instead devote their time to social reforms. Build schools and shelters, engage in neighborhood restoration, support rehabilitation programs, and the like. Act like they live in the world, that they\u2019re part of it, and recognize that their existence impacts everyone around them. They\u2019re heroes, for goodness\u2019 sake! The real heroics aren\u2019t about standing in the limelight, where everyone and everything is beautiful and shining and there\u2019s always a camera. \n        Isn\u2019t that right, Ms. Mason? Or should I call you Stupendous Gal?\n        You\u2019re asking yourself, if I\u2019ve known your identity all this time, why haven't I taken advantage of it? Because for once, you seemed inclined to listen to me, treat me like a person and not a villain. Or as a set of physical characteristics that define a person\u2019s gender in the eyes of far too many.\n        While Stupendous Gal has a certain reputation, so does Marla Mason, investigative reporter. I had hoped you might apply that reputation, not on my behalf, but on behalf of those who sorely need illumination of their circumstances. I\u2019ve become inured to the label of villain, as I said earlier. And while I don\u2019t like being named as such, as long as the city sees me in that light, I\u2019ll bear it as Atlas carried the globe on his shoulders. But the people of this city, the ones who are struggling even now to pay rent, to afford groceries, to live as they wish, are the ones who need the most help.\n        What say you, Ms. Mason? Do you bring this story to your editors? Or do you take off those ridiculous glasses that don\u2019t fool anyone and bring me to justice?\n        Ah. I wasn\u2019t expecting a third option. Which was apparently a kiss. Ahem. And you were\u2026 flirting with me when you made that outrageous comment? I see. And you\u2019ve kicked yourself a number of times over it being inappropriate? Well now. That is good to hear, and ah, I am at the very least intrigued by, as you put it, a team up.\n        Transcript of interview ends."}

You are hereby sentenced to death by hanging in three days time.\u201d \n        I hear the verdict and watch as the people in the town respond with loud, joyous sighs of feigned relief, exclamations of eternal good, and schadenfreude. Their glee is yet another dagger in my heart. A heart that has only three days left to beat. \n        The pastor tells me to confess. If I confess, there will be punishment, he explains to me. Admitting to being a witch means that I will lose my store, and likely my home, but I will not be sentenced to death. However, my conscience will not allow me to take this route. How many women\u2019s lives have been destroyed, or ultimately ended, from these hysterical accusations of witchcraft?\n         Not surprisingly, there is no solidarity. No one is thinking we should stand together because we don\u2019t know who might be next. Instead, accusing someone else of witchcraft seems to be the way other individuals try to avoid the same fate. Moreover, thoughtless fear, jealousy, undefined hatred, a desire to gain what another person has, and a general dissatisfaction with their own lives seems to play a role in defining who is accused, and who is the accuser in my town. \n        These factors are very true in my case. The accusations against me came just after my husband died. Before his death, we had a very happy life together. It was a modest life, we ran the town store together, and we had a small, one bedroom home, with a study. Nothing elaborate, save perhaps for the book collection I inherited from my father, who taught me to read. Our religion, well mine now I should say, is different from most of the town, but we kept, I still keep, quiet about that. I mean, it is a known fact about me since I am still missed at the town church on Sunday, but not something I advertise or talk about. \n        After my mother died, my father raised me, and taught me to read. As is the case with many young couples in this town, when I came of age, he arranged my marriage, but told me he would never force the issue. He just asked me to give things a chance while courting. \u201cGive it some time,\" he said, after all things worked out between him and my mother. Given our beliefs, it\u2019s not like there were many choices lined up for me.\n        Luckily in time, my father was right, my husband and I became friends and partners. Eventually we grew to love each other. We built a strong foundation during our courtship. We had many deep conversations, and agreed that while we would rather have an actual choice, since we were fated to this relationship, and there were no other avenues for either of us, we would respect each other and work together to live in the somewhat hostile environment of the town. \n        In spite of our circumstances, I can say that I was content during the few years we spent together. I was absolutely devastated when the fever took him. I promised him I would carry on, and keep the store, and live my life the best I could. I have tried to keep this promise. Sadly, we did not have children. Since my father passed away earlier in the winter from the same fever, I am alone in this world. \n         Instead of any support after my husband died, the town became hostile that I now own the store. Now that I am convicted of being a witch, the store has been given to a prominent couple in the town. A family member of theirs is now living in my home, using my things. I don\u2019t have much, but everything I have is special to me. It breaks my heart that heartless people now reside there. \n        You see, witches cannot own things, and if they are allowed to live, it is only because the people of the town show mercy upon her, after she confesses. The life she lives after their mercy is one of being shackled to the whims of the townspeople. Often she lives in poverty, unless she comes from a good family that brings her back into their fold as a sign of their benevolence.\n        I\u2019m a villain, a witch, according to the town\u2019s proclamation.  However, I\u2019m not like the witches in Macbeth who have actual powers, but a witch only as defined so by others for their malevolent purposes. I\u2019m a witch because I don\u2019t fit the mold of what a woman needs to be in this town. I tried to keep to myself both before and after my husband died. However, the fact that I was reasonably happy in my relationship, differed in my way of being from town norms, and lived a solid life because of the store, inspired envy in people who ironically have more money and social and political power than I. Hence, my conviction. \n        So here I sit in my cell. Waiting for my execution. Is there an afterlife? I don\u2019t pretend to know. I hope there is, as I would like to see my husband again.\n         I\u2019m so cold and lonely. Yet, I can\u2019t choose another path. This is who I am, and I refuse to make a false confession. Not just for myself, but for others who will travel a similar path."}

It should be no more than 1150 words.","targets":"        My research team traveled to a new star system to study a planet that our partnership-potential engineers had determined contained water and organic life. When we first entered the atmosphere, the whole team was astounded. Our organic-analysis system began to produce unprecedented data, indicating that this planet was not only inhabited but teaming with life. This was my 42nd mission. I had begun to grow weary of new planet research, but this little globe excited me in a way that reinvigorated my curiosity.\n        Once settled, we were all excited to find such rich biodiversity. Our biological-predicament specialists had prepared us to encounter several hundred unique species, so we were surprised to learn that their calculations had wildly underestimated this planet. It held not hundreds but millions of unique life forms that were able to produce fertile offspring.\n        I was enchanted with the vibrancy of life in this planet\u2019s vast ocean, which made up approximately 70% of the planet\u2019s surface. I had been to dozens of inhabited planets over the course of my career and knew that I typically enjoyed studying water creatures more than land creatures. Most biologically developed planets have similar evolutionary histories. Usually, several intelligent species live in the water, hunting, playing, and living in packs. Several other intelligent species dominate the land. Although some of the land creatures manage to live as freely as the water creatures, usually one species of dominant land creature discovers how to manage the reproduction of edible plants. As soon as a species begins to farm, they tend to expedite the process of technological development and industrialization. The dominant creatures that inhabit oceans, unfettered by such systems, are typically the most joyful on most planets.\n        Despite the fact that I requested to join the ocean team, I was assigned to land duty. The cloaking-engineers team designed me an elaborate and cumbersome suit that mimicked the skin of the land\u2019s dominant creatures and enabled me to appear in a familiar form. The suit also contained a shield that could make me invisible to any species with fewer than ten million optical cones. Our communication-engineers equipped me with a vocal device. The dominant land species transferred information mostly through a process of sucking and blowing air through chords in their throats. The suit could effectively mimic these sounds, so I could communicate with the dominant land species using a language that they could understand.\n        My team split into distinct regions on the globe. We were each tasked to study several different species in their natural habitats. We were also mandated to return to our team within twelve lunar cycles with several typical examples of the planet\u2019s species. I was assigned to a large, landlocked region that contained hundreds of native plants. My region was home to a rich array of small mammalian species and several docile, winged, warm-blooded creatures. It was also sparsely populated with the dominant land species.        \n        I set up my research center near a dominant land species population center. Using holographic features, I disguised my research base so it would appear invisible to the species I was observing. However, when necessary, I was able to customize the appearance of my research center to either attract or repel specific species. My goal was to learn about the creatures without disturbing their ecosystem.\n        Within the first lunar cycle, I effectively observed and captured several dozen species of non-dominant land creatures. I then turned my attention to the dominant species. I frequently traveled into the nearest population center to observe their cultural practices.\n        I found the dominant land species compelling. A common feature of most of this species was intimate care of offspring. In order for this species' offspring to survive, parents were required to provide extensive supervision and resources for a minimum of thirty lunar cycles. In order for the species to thrive, most offspring required additional support for as many as one hundred lunar cycles. As a result, secure connections between the parental units and their offspring were typical. \n        I spent two lunar cycles observing one particular family unit composed of one adult male, one adult female and two prepubescent siblings, one male, one female. During my observations, I used my suit\u2019s cloaking device, so I was able to observe the family without interference. This particular family arrangement was atypical in that the maternal figure was not biologically related to the offspring and did not appear to portray any of the typical affectionate bonds. In fact, on three separate occasions, the maternal figure led the siblings into the sparsely populated wooded land mass near my research center and then abandoned them there. The siblings, using primitive tracking techniques, were able to return to their home. However, on the fourth occasion, the siblings lost track of their location and began to behave erratically. I assumed that the cause of their distress was hunger.\n        At this point, I decided that this sibling pair could be easily extracted from their familial unit without causing notice or distress. First, I changed the holographic shield around my research station and made it visible. From my research, I had determined that the majority of the dominant land species were attracted to three specific stimuli: 1) the smell of baked grains, 2) bright primary colors, 3) safe shelter. Therefore, I programmed my hologram to project a familiar dominant land species structure composed of baked grains and decorated with brightly colored edible objects.\n        When the siblings encountered my cloaked research center, I made initial contact with them using my dominant land creature suit. I was able to effectively communicate with the siblings and encourage them to enter my research center.\n        Over the next two days, I observed them and took notes of their eating habits. I separated the male sibling from the female sibling and fed each differing caloric quantities to study the results on their behavior. I then contacted my research team and prepared to have the siblings evacuated for further study.\n        However, shortly before the scheduled evacuation, the female sibling discovered my hologram projector. By crudely breaking my hologram\u2019s projection device with a rock, the female sibling was able to temporarily disable the visibility shield. As I was repairing the shield, the siblings moved quickly away from the range of my research center and back into the wooded area.\n        At this point, I could have easily reacquired the siblings. However, as I watched them, their strange limbs flailing as they ran through the wooded landscape, their bodies close together and trembling, their urgency, their fear, I felt a strange sense of wonder. These creatures, dominant as they were among the other land creatures, were so vulnerable, so fragile, and yet so alive. \n        I left them alone, acquired two other similar aged subjects of their species from the nearest population center, and returned to my research team.\n"}

It was a dairy product, served cold and rich with flavor. After his first spoonful, he was instantly hooked. Unfortunately, the town that produced the treat had been razed to the ground. So he trusted his spymaster, Dur\u2019rintha, with gathering information on the subject. It turned out to be a common sight in the rest of the nation the town had belonged to. Gorthok knew where his conquest would take him next.\n        That had been a year ago. Now, Gorthok had all the iced cream he could desire, and a kitchen dedicated to producing more of it. The only problem was, he didn\u2019t spend much of his time conquering anymore. He now spends most of his time in his chambers, which is exactly where Dur\u2019rintha found him.\n        She pushed the great iron slabs he used instead of doors open to reveal the great conqueror cuddled up on a couch, a large bowl of ice cream in his hands, and a blanket tucked around him. His figure had shifted from \u201clarge and sturdy\u201d to \u201clarge and flabby\u201d. It pained her to see him like that. \n        \u201cAgain?!\u201d She cried from the doorway.\n        Gorthok twitched and turned to look at her. His eyes were red and puffy, like he\u2019d been crying for some time. \n        \u201cGo away! None may stand in my presence while I\u2019m\u2026 meditating,\u201d he said. \n        Dur\u2019rintha closed the gap between herself and the couch in two strides. She snatched the bowl of ice cream out of Gorthok\u2019s hands and brandished it before her like a sword. \n        \u201cYou are not meditating! You\u2019re moping, no matter what you tell the troops,\u201d she said.\n        Gorthok frowned and turned away.\n        \u201cI\u2019m not moping. And besides, what does it matter? The horde is doing just fine without me,\u201d He said. \n        Dur\u2019rintha moved into Gorthok\u2019s line of sight. He turned away again. She reached out and grabbed his head, forcing her to look at him. \n        \u201cThe horde is fine for now. You\u2019ve done a great job building this force up, but if you don\u2019t get yourself out of this funk, you\u2019re going to lose them, and then they\u2019re going to catch the brunt of the kickback for all your conquests,\u201d Dur\u2019rintha said. \n        As she looked into his eyes, they started running over with tears. That sight shot a bolt of terror into her heart. But she grabbed that fear, wrested it to the side, and gained control of herself. Sighing deeply, she prepared to provide the one thing she never thought she would for this man: emotional support.\n        \u201cAlright. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n        Gorthok sniffed and wiped his eyes. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 he hasn\u2019t\u2026 he hasn\u2019t returned any of my prayers!\u201d \n        Gorthok sounded as though those last words were ripped out of him. He burst into loud sobs that wracked his entire body. Dur\u2019rintha just stared blankly at him.\n        \u201cWait, you\u2019ve been praying? To whom? Wait, no, no, no. You\u2019re not talking about Lord Arindu?\u201d\n        Years ago, when Gorthok was just another man in the middle of his village living a thoroughly uneventful life, he had received a vision from the divine. The God of War and Combat, Arindu, descended from the heavens. He stood immaculate before the mere mortal, who in turn looked up to gaze upon the deity. \n        In that instant, he fell hopelessly in love.\n        Arindu chose Gorthok to be the worker of his will in the world. His blessing was powerful enough that the whole world came to believe in it. A man who was once a mere farmer rose to become a scourge through a god\u2019s influence, and the entire world quaked at his might. At least, it did. \n        \u201cI don\u2019t know what he wants anymore! I burned three villages, razed a castle to the ground, and even salted the earth behind me! It used to be all I had to do was conquer a village, and we\u2019d stay up for nights and nights in communion, but now he won\u2019t even return my prayers,\u201d Gorthok said.\n        Dur\u2019rintha had heard the legends of Gorthok\u2019s communion with the war God, but had always chalked the stories up to myths he had invented to give his conquests an air of divine legitimacy. She had no idea that Arindu was not only real, but actively talking to her commander\u2026 or at least had been. \n        But Dur\u2019rintha had seen this before. In fact, she had experienced the same plague that was currently afflicting her commander.\n        \u201cDo you remember that time I was seeing Guulin?\u201d Dur\u2019rintha asked. \n        Gorthok wiped his eyes again.\n        \u201cYeah.

They obviously had ignored the \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d signs posted around his property. Somehow, they managed to maneuver through the barbed wire fence that was supposed to keep strangers at bay. \n\tHe couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying. However, their body language said it all.  A scrawny, towheaded boy holding a small burlap bag stood in front of his two larger friends. They pushed him forward, encouraging him to move closer to the house. His blue sneakers were slightly too big, and he stumbled, tripping over his own feet. He treaded lightly up the dirt walkway and up the rickety porch steps. Hands shaking, he hesitantly knocked on the door three times and dropped the bag. \n\tThe boys did not wait for Jeremiah to answer. They darted back down the dirt path, hurdling over rusted metal tools. Fueled with adrenaline, they screamed and laughed. Their howling echoed even when they were down the road. \n\tJeremiah took his time opening the door. A slither of harmless bull snakes hissed and crawled out of the bag. One flicked his tongue to inspect Jerimaih\u2019s boot. With no remorse, he kicked the coil of snakes off the porch. \n\tJeremiah was not the kind of recluse who was just misunderstood. He earned every bit of his vile reputation. His father abandoned his family when Jeremiah was only three years old. He hated school for many reasons. He was labeled \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201ctrouble-maker\u201d early on. This led him to be held back twice. His peers bullied him, and his teachers wrote him off. \n\tHe had numerous run-ins with the law before he was even a teenager. His mother couldn\u2019t control him. Frankly, she didn\u2019t have the energy nor the desire to do so. She kicked him out of the house when he was only fourteen.  At that point, he decided he might as well drop out of school and become a career criminal. \n\tFrom shoplifting to arson to assault, Jeremiah wreaked havoc in his small town. After his second stint in prison, he was tired of being controlled and in trouble. After careful reflection, he decided it might be best if he went off the grid. With his meager savings, he bought a piece of land tucked away in the woods. He refurbished the abandoned cabin on the property.  Without people around to test him, he managed to keep himself out of trouble for years. \n\tMost people had the sense to stay away from Jeremiah\u2019s property. The signs made it clear that visitors were not welcome. As of late, though, a trio of junior high school students took great delight in daring each other to taunt the \u201cmadman.\u201d At first, they simply wanted to catch a glimpse of Jeremiah and see if he was really the monster that the rumors painted. When nothing happened to them, they grew bolder. They started leaving \u201cgifts\u201d on his doorstep and throwing rocks at his house. \n\tTheir blatant disrespect made him furious. In his younger days, his retaliation would have been swift and certainly would have landed him back in prison. Now, he would never do anything to harm a child. However, he was not above giving them the scare of their lives. One that would guarantee that they would never step near his property again. \n\tThe sun set earlier on the chilly winter days. A light dusting of snow covered the ground. Jeremiah was able to stay back a bit and follow the boys\u2019 footprints unnoticed. His olive green coat and brown pants camouflaged him as he crept from tree to tree. \n\tThe trio talked loudly about their plans for their sleepover tonight. Jeremiah listened in as they discussed the night of pizza, scary movies, and video games that lay ahead of them. They unknowingly led him right to the scrawny boy\u2019s house, three miles down the road. \n\tJeremiah hid within the branches of a balsam fir and watched the boys race each other in the final stretch. They charged through the door of the ranch style home to begin their evening of fun. \n\tJeremiah waited.\n\tDusk turned to the blackness of night. Through the picture window, the illuminated family room stood out against the heavy darkness. The boys gathered around the TV to play video games.\n\tThe snow started to fall harder.  The dusting was now a thick, untouched carpet of snow. Jeremiah hunkered down as he watched the lights in the house go out one by one. The family room light went out last. It was time to make his move.\n\tJeremiah tightened the cord on his hood. Stoop-shouldered, he quietly hastened to the family room window. He raised his body up just enough to see in the window. The boys had crashed out, tucked in their sleeping bags. A zombie movie flickered on the TV. A gray tabby cat curled up on the back of the couch was fast asleep as well. \n\tTwigs and branches snapped under the weight of Jeremiah crawling over them. The cat raised its head. When it didn\u2019t see anything outside, it yawned and went back to sleep. \n\tHe picked up one of the larger branches from the ground. Ever so slowly, he raked it across the window. Screeeeeeeech \n\tThis time the cat and the scrawny boy lifted their heads. The boy, with widened eyes, scanned the room. He shook his head rapidly and laid back down. \n\tThirty minutes passed. Jeremiah scraped the window again. Screeeeeeeeeech. \n\tThis time, the other boys heard the eerie noise. All three bolted straight up. They exchanged nervous glances and sat quietly listening for several minutes.  The scrawny boy army-crawled over to the window and peered into the darkness. Jeremiah squatted under the window, pressed against the house. The boy turned back to his friends and shrugged. They settled into their sleeping bags, pulling them up over their heads. \n\tJeremiah smiled a wicked smile. Again, he waited.\n\tTwo hours passed. Jeremiah rose to his feet. He blew his warm breath onto the cold glass. He lifted his index finger to the fogged window. Backwards, he wrote an ominous message: \u201cI SEE YOU\u201d. \n\tHe gave three slow, loud knocks on the window. He saw the silhouette of the cat dart out of the room. Jeremiah disappeared into the dark forest before the trio could even turn the lights on. \n\tHe didn\u2019t need to see their reactions. He could imagine the chaos that would ensue when they saw his message and his footprints in the snow outside the window. Most of all, he knew the look of terror they would have when they found the three bull snake skins pinned to a tree stump with an old hunting knife. \n\tAfter that night, the boys were not as bold with Jeremiah. In fact, they steered completely clear of his property. He fully anticipated someone might pay him a visit to inquire about the events of the evening. No one ever did. He suspected that their parents wrote it off as a prank played by one of their classmates. \n\tThe winter snow melted into spring. Jeremiah headed to town to pick up some supplies. He strolled down the narrow aisles of the local hardware store. He turned down the tool aisle and saw a familiar face. The scrawny, tow-headed boy was entertaining himself as his father looked at hammers. He ran his hands back and forth across the wrenches, making them clank and swing wildly. \n\tThe boy looked up and met Jeremiah\u2019s cold gaze. His shoulders tensed, and he backed up closer to his father. Mouth agape, the boy watched his tormenter walk past him.\n\tJeremiah reached the end of the aisle. He stopped and glanced over his shoulder. He raised his hand. With two fingers, he pointed to his own eyes and then to the boy. A sinister smile spread across his face. The boy trembled, and Jeremiah walked away. \n"}

A flight attendant \u2014 or maybe an Air Marshal \u2014 had just tried punching in the emergency code, and he hit the override. It would be another thirty minutes before they could try again. He shook his head sadly. \n       The Los Angeles skyline loomed ahead of him. To the right, he could see the San Gabriel Mountains, the Los Angeles River, and an endless sprawl of palm trees and neon lights.\n       Bam. Bam. Bam.\n       Julio ran his hands over his face, through his hair and down the back of his neck. His vision roamed across the control panel, noting the altimeter and the heading and speed indicators. Six thousand feet, two hundred and fifty knots. He chuckled. Wouldn\u2019t want to break any speed limits.\n       Checking the navigational aid, he could see that the plane was slightly to the left of the heading he needed. He reached out towards the middle of the control panel and pressed the landing system localizer. As he did so, he had to turn his body slightly to the right. This brought the co-pilot's seat into his peripheral vision, and he glimpsed Daphne, his Aussie co-pilot, slumped over, still buckled in.\n       Bam. Bam. Bam.\n       His right hand unconsciously went to the cupholder and felt the Glock 19 pistol there.\n       Julio thought back several months to the time he had completed his Flight Deck Officer training. I just wanted to protect the souls on my flights.\n       Wiping a tear from his eye, Julio glanced at Daphne again. The bullet hole in her temple had burn marks around it but very little blood.\n       I can still smell the nitro.\n       In the distance, he could make out Long Beach and the Queen Mary. \n       \u201cTower,\u201d Julio said aloud as he stared down at SoFi Stadium lit up below, \u201cI can see you have turned on the landing lights.

He thought about the voice that had spoken from his wife\u2019s phone just before he had arrived at the airport.\n       \u201cJames and little churro are fine. Your Princesa says to be home this weekend for Trivial Pursuit and pizza night.\u201d Then the call ended.\n       Little churro. Julio Junior\u2019s nickname. His wife, Veronica, he called her Princesa. Trivial Pursuit, and pizza. They hated both of those things.\n       The next phone call came after he had passed through security. He had not been able to reach his wife or his sons on their mobile phones.\n       \u201cDo not alert the authorities. Get on the plane. Fly to Los Angeles. Before you land, you need to shoot your co-pilot and crash your plane into Los Angeles SoFi Stadium. Otherwise, your wife and sons will die horribly.\u201d\n       Dazed, Julio had boarded the plane. As the flight crew moved in and out of the open cockpit in preparation, he received a series of texts. Images of a package being put into the cargo hold. An earlier image of the package open, with what looked like wires and switches inside. Then a final text:\n       Everyone on that plane is dead already. Do what \n       we say, or your wife and sons will die horribly. \n       Your sons in front of your wife, then your wife last.\n       Julio had flown the plane almost in a trance. When they had passed over the high desert and Los Angeles could be seen on the horizon, he had pulled his sidearm and shot Daphne point-blank. She had never known what had happened. One minute she prattled on about a boyfriend in Ontario, the next minute nothing.\n       As he slowed the plane and made his descent, his mind raced.\n       If I try to land the plane, it could blow up. If I crash the plane, thousands more could die. He sobbed uncontrollably as he thought of his wife and children. \n       Then he remembered Inglewood Lake Park adjacent to the stadium.

{"example_id":"example_040","inputs":"Write a story from the villain\u2019s perspective that makes us understand their views and motivations. The story should be written in the first-person point of view and center around a young boy (the narrator) whose name we never learn. The boy (villain) was left in a park in London, near a fountain, as a baby, by his mother. The memory of his mother is hazy, and all he knows about being left is what he\u2019s heard around the city of London. The police searched for the boy's family, but they were never found. Eventually, the boy goes to live on a farm with a family just outside of London\u2019s city limits. The family treats the boy terribly, using him to work on the farm at a young age, but feeding him very little. Once the family\u2019s household grows to twelve people, they kick the boy out, leaving him on the edge of England\u2019s countryside, so he must make the trek back to London. When he arrives, he comes across a tall, old building that is dark and nearly falling apart. After he finds an abandoned flat to hide out in for a few days, he is found by an old lady, Martha, who takes him in as a foster child. Martha teaches the boy how to cook, read, and write, but eventually, she passes away, and the boy is left alone again. He makes his way out into the woods, seven miles away from the city of London, where he sleeps on top of a pile of leaves. As he continues wandering the woods he finds a dark clearing along with a black spring of water. The boy hears the dark clearing calling to him, and as he stands under it, he sees his life before him - all the pain and hurt he has throughout. He also finds some red plants with black edges. He uses that to create a potion, which he takes to London to sell. The effects of his potion are twofold - first, the drinker has intense feelings of happiness and euphoria, then, they become dark and depressed, with feelings of loneliness and sadness. They continue buying the potion because they keep chasing that first euphoric feeling, but to no avail. The story concludes with the villain stating: \u201cNow, we walk amongst one another, vague and broken. But I am no longer alone.\u201d  The story should be about 1,450 - 1,500 words.","targets":"        It started when I was young.\n        I have this vague, almost blacked-out memory. All I can see is a thick haze, like fog, clouding my mind. But the way my body feels in those moments makes it all clear. My mother, the one who was supposed to love me, be my joy, and hold me when I\u2019m sad, left me outside in the cold London rain. Her hands were paper-thin, but I can still hear her heartbeat somehow. I can feel the ancient stone walkway in the park's cold, damp atmosphere, chilling my spine.\n        From what I\u2019ve been told, I was found by some children who were tossing a ball near the large, waterfall-like fountain. The rough, round globe nearly slammed into my ribs as gravity pulled it back down. Talk of the \u201cbaby by the fountain\u201d rushed across the city. Every mother said, \u201cHow terrible,\u201d or \u201cI wonder who the mother could be.\u201d The police took me to their station. They sent out notices and hung posters on every lamppost and building - signs saying, \u201cLost boy. Please claim\u201d or \u201cDo you know this child?\u201d  No one ever came forward. \n        After that, I was placed with a family, the Parsons, who owned a farmhouse and a bit of property just outside the city. They already had a bundle of their own children - six or seven of them, I believe. Every day at the farmhouse, I was pushed in every direction - feed the cows, clean the fields, bathe the horses - all to be given a measly bowl of soup, a slice of sourdough, and a cup of water at the end of the day. I slept in the kitchen on a flimsy cot ripping at the seams, with no pillow and a thin muslin cloth for a blanket. \n        By the time I was ten, they had grown to a family of twelve (not including me), an amazing feat considering the illnesses that happened to be going around at the time. They finally decided their family had grown large enough, and instead of trying to find another placement home for me, they kicked me out. Standing there on the edge of the dirty road, I began the trek back to the city of London.\n        Right on the city\u2019s margin was an old building that looked like it had been there since the beginning of time. It was tall, the outside brick turning the darkest shade of rotting brown. The rain that day felt especially cold, so I slipped in behind some older man with a large top hat and a cane. I skipped up to the top floor, where there was only one inhabitant behind a closed door. Every other door was open to a wretched sight: decaying wood, water dripping from the cracks in the ceiling, and mold strewn across the floor. But, it was better than being outside. \n        After days of curling up in the driest corners I could find, the woman who lived behind the door, Martha, found me and became my foster mother. She was sweet, but very old. There was a lot she couldn\u2019t do; her bones were like fragile twigs. She could hardly walk up and down the rickety stairs to and from our top-floor flat. Martha would send me out, day and night, to buy the essentials - bread, milk, whatever it was we needed. I always spent the change on chocolates and gumdrops. I know I should have saved the extra money, but it was a small bit of joy - a break from my reality - that I had in between sleepless nights of rats and cockroaches crawling around my head at the top of my bed. I stayed with Martha for four years. She did her best - she showed me how to cook, she would sit on her old, musty red chair and tell me what ingredients to put in the pot. She showed me how to write letters, although I was never great at spelling or staying in between the lines on the paper. Although her handwriting was disheveled now, I could see how, in her youth, her hands must have been able to glide across the paper elegantly and effortlessly. \n        Martha, bless her soul, eventually came to pass, and there I was once more, alone. She had no family, so I was the only one who attended the funeral, which was held in the nearest graveyard, two blocks from our flat. Then I was placed in a home for lost children. The police and Jane, the woman who ran the house, still searched tirelessly for my birth parents, despite the fourteen-year mystery, but to no avail. All the kids were lost, but it felt like there was something different about me. The other children had some idea of where they came from and how they got there. Some had parents who died in war; some had parents who died from illnesses; and some had parents who just weren\u2019t fit to be parents. For me, it was black, except for that first hazy memory. \n        After four months, I grew tired of sleepless nights and cold, hard beds that never gave me any comfort. I could no longer tolerate the blankets that had so many holes in them that they didn\u2019t even serve their main purpose - to keep me warm. So, I packed up the few belongings I had and left the children\u2019s home. This may have been my biggest mistake\u2014the choice that led me to my current life\u2014but I craved some form of freedom. The only place I knew to run where I wouldn\u2019t be found was the woods, about seven miles outside London. I slept on a pile of dry, warm leaves that night. It may sound strange, but it was more comfortable than any bed I had ever been given growing up.\n        I was about fourteen at this point, and although I was more alone than I\u2019d ever been, the woods seemed to welcome me with rising trunks and bushy tops. I woke in the morning to the sun shining and birds chirping. As I walked deeper, the leaves brushing against my legs where my pants had holes, I found a clearing. It was possibly the strangest clearing I had ever seen. There was no semblance of sunlight or beaming rays, but instead a faded blue, like deepening twilight. There was a magnetic force pushing - no, pulling - me in. Standing in the middle of the false starlight, a voice told me to close my eyes. I shut them tightly and saw so many deep memories. All the pain, hurt, and pressure I had felt. This overwhelming desire to just be a kid\u2014to have the love, the home, and the support that every child so desperately needs. \n        Something in me changed that day. \n        I now knew what I had to do. I was never meant for those things - for sweet, homely things. Loving, caring hands weren't in my deck of cards. I was angry for a while, but then I transformed that anger into a plan. I worked tirelessly, day and night, for three years. I built a shelter in the woods and would visit the clearing every day. Each time, becoming more and more powerful. It directed me to some plants I had never seen before - large, red leaves with darker, black edges, and a black spring of running water that only I could see.  Not only that, but the clearing taught me how to manifest all the pain in the world into one single soul - my soul. \nYou see, when I would cook for Martha, this astounding feeling would come over me - a feeling that, with one pot or kettle of something - I had the potential to change the world. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but those techniques she taught me for nourishment would become my greatest power and everyone else\u2019s greatest downfall.\n        With the plants and black spring, I created a potion, returned to the city each day, and started selling it to the masses. I visited corner stores, markets, and anywhere else that stocked food items, commissioning it under the guise of a new type of fermentation that was equal parts tasty and fueled with happiness. The potion's effects were twofold. First, the drinker would feel a stunning sense of joy and pleasure, a euphoric perception of the world around them. Then, the drinker would become disrupted with feelings of poignancy and anguish. But, all they could remember was that first feeling, so they kept buying more and more and drinking it every day. One by one, as they consumed the sweet nectar of pain, their eyes darkened. They wandered the streets, plagued by the most somber thoughts and memories. All happiness had been erased; it was fleeting and transitory. Finally, all they knew was what I had known my whole life - darkness. I could take solace knowing they understood me. Now, we walk amongst one another, vague and broken. But I am no longer alone. \n"}

I\u2019ve been trapped in this building for ages, and that would fill any soul with horror. A being can only manage so much confusion before they burst. I had the misfortune of learning this lesson decades ago. Perhaps centuries.\n        The hotel is old\u2014even older than me\u2014but has been renovated dozens of times. I\u2019m forced to glance upon its new-age walls, these grays, beiges, and whites, pacing incessantly under its hideous blue lighting. In being trapped, I\u2019m forced to think of older days, the way the world used to be and will be nevermore. It\u2019s the perfect sentence for my crime; endless time and a same yet ever-changing space to reflect upon the error of my ways, trapped in a solitary confinement of sorts.\n        Of sorts, referring to the fact that I\u2019m irretrievably isolated, yet, not alone. I\u2019d elaborate that this is a perfectly crafted hell. The hotel has only grown in popularity over the years, and all three floors are occupied on a regular basis. More than simply guests, these people are my tormentors. Odd gaggles of people in scandalous and sloppy clothing populate the lobby, almost always touting the same small hand contraptions and futuristic cameras that look like portals to other worlds. Most visitors seem intrigued by word of a haunting, desiring to peek a glimpse at the supernatural. I would relay to these tourists that there was nothing to see, that the story I\u2019m marooned in is nothing but an egregious lie. All these ridiculous people have come to see me, but only I can see them.\n        I seem to have made this hotel a kind of attraction. All these new-aged folk know my story, and they come here because of it. They know about Quick-Draw Archie Montgomery, they know about his sister Julia Marlee, and they know all about me, Evil Perry Whittaker. I\u2019d love to cry out to these hoards of visitors, reach out onto the lapels of their ugly big jackets one by one, and yell, \u201cYou haven\u2019t been told the truth!\u201d \n        Archie Montgomery wasn\u2019t the vigilante everyone believes he is, but he had once been like a brother to me. He taught me how to survive out on the plains of New Mexico, where we\u2019d move from town to town, living off of scraps and evading lawmen. We\u2019d cheat at cards, steal horses, and take what we could after each successful duel - and there were many. Sometimes between Archie\u2019s cheating and theft, he\u2019d share part of the stolen loot with the hungry, the lost, and the destitute. These random acts of charity managed to offset the damage that his fiery temper would wreak. He wasn\u2019t given the nickname \u201cQuick-Draw\u201d solely for his success in pistol duels, but for the sudden flares of anger that would leave a room full of men empty and bullet-riddled at a moment\u2019s notice. I stuck by his side through all his escapades, and we trusted each other implicitly. Everything changed the day he introduced me to his new love, Miss Marlee.\n        I\u2019d never met anyone else like her. Julia was the Santa Fe Saloon owner\u2019s daughter and the best saloon girl in town. She had an angelic voice, dreamy eyes, and was remarkably kind. At the Saloon, she was quick with a whiskey and a comforting word for any exhausted patron, especially myself. I tried my best to keep distance between us, but time and circumstance rapidly drew us together.\n        I would explain plainly to the modern false-informed that I was never the type to betray a friend, but Archie never treated her right. In fact, he treated her downright terrible. Being the shoulder she\u2019d cry on after each of his violent outbursts, Julia began to melt my ice-cold heart. We fell in love fast, aware from the start how dangerous an affair would be. Unfortunately, Archie\u2019s heart would always remain stone.\n        She became everything to me, but I knew he\u2019d never sympathize, much less keep himself from taking revenge. Escape was our only option. Julia and I began to plot the life we could live beyond his reach, packed up the little we had, and rode horses into the dead of night, headed south. We fled to a hotel two states away, naively believing it to be a stop on the road to the rest of our lives.\n        The journey would end there. Within a fortnight Quick-Draw came looking for us, and when he found us in Room 336, he drew quick. He missed me with his first two shots, and I fired back, striking him square in the chest. When I turned around, Julia had collapsed onto the carpet, bleeding profusely. In agony I rushed to her side, but Archie called out to me. Turning from her last moments, I witnessed his near-death face, which has since burned into my memory: mustache, beard, and pale blue eyes knit in ghastly anger. Terrified, I fled the scene.\n        This would prove my undoing. Though I\u2019d survived, my reputation did not. From what the posters along these hotel walls preach, Quick-Draw was a righter of wrongs, a Wild West avenger. Julia is the fated victim beside him - half the romance that couldn\u2019t be. I, the apparent \u2018evil\u2019 perpetrator, died in Abilene while cheating in a card game years later and awoke in the very room I\u2019d killed him in. The site of my worst memory. \n        No one knows Archie and I were a team or that Julia fell in love with me, but they know a ghost haunts the third floor of the hotel, and he attacks guests who provoke him. The worst of it all is the fact that I\u2019m not attacking anyone, yet no one will ever understand. They continue to visit in droves, hunting ghosts they cannot see. I grab people by their shoulders and cry, though they\u2019ll never hear me: \u201cYou just don\u2019t know the truth!\u201d"}

The last rebellion was, what, twenty years ago? All the dissidents stamped out, all the deviants eliminated, everybody\u2019s one big happy family divided into their work units and affiliation groups. Everyone has a place, and everyone in their place, and no room for anybody to fall through the cracks, right?\u201d\n        Stepper snorted. \u201cExcept for us, and whomever else there is out there who doesn\u2019t fit in. You\u2019d think WorldGov\u2019d have the statistics, right? You found those notes in the archive, the ones that talk about the percentage of what they called LGBTQIA people?\u201d\n        \u201cSomewhere near one in fourteen,\u201d Jammer responded. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a lot of us out there, but WorldGov makes sure they don\u2019t know what they are. You and me, we only got out because we ran before the authorities got to us and reformatted our brains. Made us think we were two women, put us in pretty dresses, bowing and serving and the rest.\u201d\n        Stepper shuddered. \u201cOr made Bobbisox think she liked men.\u201d\n        \u201cExactly. WorldGov would\u2019ve made us fit their idea of people, never mind what we wanted. We got out, thanks to Ash. Their parents are happy little cogs in WorldGov, but Ash wasn\u2019t ever gonna be happy as just one gender. I dunno how Ash figured the three of us out before WorldGov could, but even with the hiding and surviving, I\u2019m still glad I\u2019m here an\u2019 not there.\u201d\n        The interior door to the bunker slid open, and Bobbisox bounced in, gleeful and balancing a couple of duffle bags across her shoulders. Instead of her usual habit of throwing \u201cliberated\u201d goods onto the floor, she called, \u201cHey, bit of help here you two. Delicates, and I don\u2019t mean pretty underthings.\u201d\n        Stepper was on his feet immediately, while Jammer carefully put down the soldering iron and switched it off before they stood up. Bobbisox was fantastic at scavenging, and if she said something was delicate, there was a good chance it was technology they didn\u2019t have access to.\n        \u201cHow\u2019d you get this stuff?\u201d Stepper asked with a bit of teasing in his voice. \n        \u201cWorldGov shut down a clinic, but some bureaucratic snafu meant the removal teams didn\u2019t get to it right away.\u201d\n        Jammer whistled. \u201cWait, a clinic clinic? Like medical scanners, surgery beds, that kind of thing?\u201d\n        Bobbisox winked, and responded, \u201cExactly. I couldn\u2019t get everything out of there, not without getting all the wrong kind of attention, but most of the internals were easy enough. Ash confirmed last year that WorldGov just tosses all of it into a crusher, so nobody can get it onto the black market. And the removal teams don\u2019t check the weight before loading it up.\u201d\n        As Stepper was unloading the first duffle bag, he swore. \u201cDid you disassemble one of the surgery beds? I mean, either that, or you removed a bit of internal working from every single machine.\u201d\n        \u201cI thought about disassembling one of the beds,\u201d Bobbisox said with a shrug, \u201cbut that\u2019d have been obvious and we already have one.

Good news, bad news, I\u2019m afraid. The parents are going away for a week, and I have to go with them.\u201d\n        Jammer grimaced as they continued unpacking, moving on to the second duffle. \u201cSorry to hear that, friend. But what\u2019s the good news?\u201d\n        \u201cLooks like Bobbisox got the good news. I used my dad\u2019s passcode to delay the removal team for a clinic that WorldGov shut down. I couldn\u2019t juggle the asset inventory, though,\u201d Ash sighed as they went behind a screen to change clothes. \u201cBut I think maybe there\u2019s enough there to get our surgery bed operational, maybe. Bypass the restrictions, get it working the way we want. What do you think, Jammer?\u201d\n        Jammer looked everything over, and started nodding slowly. \u201cI think yeah. It should be enough to get the machine running, get Stepper fixed up right. A body that\u2019s his, and not the body he grew up in.\u201d\n        \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll abandon you,\u201d Stepper responded instantly. \u201cWorldGov\u2019s records won\u2019t list me as a guy, and anyway, you\u2019re my friends. I don\u2019t abandon friends.\u201d\n        Bobbisox put a hand on Stepper\u2019s shoulder, and squeezed gently. \u201cNever thought you would, Step.\u201d She was about to say more when Jammer whistled low and long in surprise.\n        Ash came out in a dress and tilted their head. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n        \u201cComms tech. Like, kind of the piece I needed for my little transmitter project,\u201d Jammer responded, reverently. \u201cI\u2019d kiss you, Bobbisox, if that wouldn\u2019t make it weird.\u201d\n        Bobbisox curtsied, the way WorldGov taught the population they identified as women to do, and grinned. \u201cOkay, my instincts were right then. And I know you, you\u2019re not talking about the kind of kiss I\u2019m looking for, but heartfelt thanks go a long, long way.\u201d She settled on the scavenged couch, and exhaled slowly. \u201cYou really think that transmitter thing\u2019ll work?\u201d\n\tJammer leaned back a bit, and thought. \u201cWe all know the story from that archive we found. A hundred years ago, humanity had a big fight over people like us. Those like us, or who supported us, tried to make things better, but the rest became WorldGov and drove them off. They\u2019d built starships in secret, though, and saved who they could. And said they\u2019d come back for us in the future, on account of how humanity just keeps having children, and people like us are actually normal and not deviants like WorldGov says.\u201d\n        Stepper sighed as he began putting the electronics into their makeshift shelving units. \u201cIt sounds all right, but wouldn\u2019t they have come back before? That\u2019s why I don\u2019t know if this\u2019ll work, Jam.\u201d\n        They nodded as they finished emptying the second duffle. \u201cI know. But that receiver I built before I ran? It was picking up something other than background radiation.\u201d Jammer held up the precious piece of technology. \u201cThe tech should be similar. I know I can build a receiver, and the information in the archive told me how to build a protected transmitter. Now it\u2019s just a matter of putting it together.\u201d They looked over at Stepper. \u201cAfter making the bed work, of course. The bed, then the transmitter.\u201d\n        He looked around the room, then at Jammer. Ash and Bobbisox were silent, watching the two with concern.\n        Finally, Stepper said, \u201cIf they\u2019re out there, they\u2019ve had a hundred years to improve the technology WorldGov uses. How long will it take you to build your transmitter?\u201d\n        Jammer began to smile. \u201cA couple of hours, maybe less.\u201d\n        Bobbisox exhaled. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that, as long as the bed goes next. Stepper\u2019s needed this for years.\u201d She looked over at Jammer. \u201cYou too, though. Ash can\u2019t, not yet, because their parents would notice. But don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t seen you sighing about the parts of your body that aren\u2019t right for you.\u201d She looked at Ash. \u201cSpeaking of, how long do you have?\u201d\n        They shrugged, their dress shifting slightly. \u201cMy parent-lackeys leave the day after tomorrow. I\u2019m over at a friend\u2019s house, and we\u2019re studying for the entrance exams. Jason\u2019s kept my cover all this time, I trust him.\u201d\n        Stepper nodded. \u201cOkay, transmitter first, then get the bed up and running. I should get out and scavenge some food. It\u2019s about time for the markets to start dumping the unused stuff, and if Bobbisox is up for going out again, we can get back with a few days worth of supplies by the time you\u2019re done, Jammer.\u201d When the young woman nodded, Stepper grinned. \u201cAny requests? I figure whatever happens, we\u2019ll want a bit of a feast.\u201d\n        Ash perched on the couch after the two left, watching quietly while Jammer assembled the transmitter they\u2019d designed. Based on the blueprints from the archive, it was slow progress since technology had advanced in the past century. But by the time Stepper and Bobbisox came back with food, the transmitter was ready, humming quietly. Ash had changed outfits a couple of times during that hour and a half, needing to accommodate their gender shifts, and was now in a pair of sporty black leggings and a sleeveless tunic salvaged from a clothing shop.\n        Jammer helped put the food away, bouncing a little bit as they did. Stepper was quiet, but Bobbisox filled in the gap with all the gossip she\u2019d collected about various people they knew before they went on the run from WorldGov. The bunker they\u2019d found was underground, built back during the war when there\u2019d been the threat of city-destroying weapons, then abandoned after WorldGov took over. It still got enough power for them to live, and over time Stepper had rerouted other essential utilities, making it enough of a home for the three of them to hide from WorldGov. \n        Finally, Ash, Stepper, and Bobbisox settled onto the couch as the only place big enough for them, while Jammer sat on a scavenged chair and began tuning the device into the frequency they\u2019d last identified. Almost immediately, a voice began speaking, not quite male or female.\n        \u201c\u2013 we have monitoring stations around the planet, listening for your signal. We hope the totalitarian state hasn\u2019t suppressed all of you, and that some of you can find this message and respond. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, we\u2019re free, and you can be too. All we need is you to respond. We will return to Earth, but we can\u2019t until we know for sure there are people like us who need us. End of message, message repeats tomorrow on this frequency.\u201d\n        The four of them looked at each other in shock. \n        \u201cWorldGov has to have been suppressing this for decades now,\u201d Stepper whispered.\n        Ash had gone sickly pale. \u201cMy dad\u2019s pretty high up in WorldGov, and I\u2019ve never heard even a whisper of this.\u201d\n        Bobbisox stood abruptly and started pacing. \u201cOf course they hide it! Of course they control all the communication! They can\u2019t risk anyone hearing that message!\u201d She turned on Jammer, and nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to respond. Can we do that without giving away the location of the bunker?\u201d\n        It took Jammer a few moments to respond, but they nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been planning to send a message for years. It\u2019ll go out from the entire city, because I made it so there\u2019s no way to narrow down where it\u2019s coming from. But we only get one shot at this; if I do it again, WorldGov will figure out a way to find the bunker.\u201d\n        Stepper blinked, tears running down his face. \u201cWhat do we say to them?\u201d\n        Ash took a shuddery breath, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, we need your help.\u201d They laughed a bit. \u201cUse some of their words, make sure they hear us.\u201d\n        When the others nodded in agreement, Jammer coded the message, then sent it.\n        For the rest of the evening, the four of them busied themselves around the bunker. Almost immediately, the newscasts went dark, replaced by more explicit propaganda from WorldGov, asking any good citizen to turn in anyone they suspected of \u201cterrorist attacks.\u201d Jammer decided to focus on getting the surgery bed up and running; Ash functioned as both a go-fer and a second pair of hands for some of the more intensive repairs. Bobbisox monitored their cameras, kept an eye on the public broadcasts, and fiddled with their escape bags in between. Stepper decided he\u2019d make food for the group at one point, so they all took a break for dinner, even though none of them was particularly hungry.\n        Sometime after midnight, Jammer pronounced the bed ready to go. But before they could ask Stepper if he wanted to get in now or wait until the morning, the air in the room shifted, pressure increasing and decreasing suddenly. The continuous propaganda flashing on the screen in the corner of the room went dark, and the four friends looked at each other with apprehension.\n        The black screen suddenly lit with the image of a person unlike anybody the WorldGov would ever have put in front of their cameras. The person\u2019s face looked like a mix of what the WorldGov would have labeled \u201cassertively masculine\u201d and \u201cdelicately feminine,\u201d and they wore clothes that seemed to be some kind of uniform but without the obvious military aspects favored by WorldGov.\n        \u201cGreetings, people of Earth,\u201d the person began. \u201cA century ago, we were driven off-planet by the people you now call WorldGov. In their pursuit of a supposed ideological purity, they decided to eliminate everyone who didn\u2019t fit in, and they have continued this practice over the decades that they have controlled the Earth. I represent the Alliance, and we have been waiting all this time for a request for help that WorldGov would never have permitted. But somewhere, someone among you has reached out to us, and we are back.\u201d The person smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, and we bring liberation from the totalitarian state.\u201d\n        As Jammer stared at the screen, their transmitter sprang to life, with the same voice as the person on the screen. \u201cWorldGov is nearby. We\u2019re sending a craft to get you, whoever sent us that brave, brave message, but we need you to be ready. Bring only what you can carry, but be sure to bring your transmitter. Head for the large open space with the lake, our craft will find you there. Be brave, freedom is coming.\u201d\n        In moments, the four of them had grabbed their escape bags, and were heading out the door, Jammer at the end with the transmitter. \n        As they ran down the tunnel for the surface, Stepper managed, \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t believe you, Jam.\u201d\n        \u201cEscape now, apologize later,\u201d Jammer responded.\n"}

Enjoy the holiday, but not before the edits are in.\u201d John laughs at his own joke as he saunters away. \n        I hate John. My dog hates John. Not that she has met him, but she always sides with me. To describe John in short, he is an egotistical bully that missed the memo that people no longer wear tight khaki pants. I seriously wonder how he is able to sit down at his desk.\n        I\u2019ve been waiting for him to get me this copy for over a week, and now the night before the holiday he finally gives it to me less than an hour before we are set to leave. No problem. I can work late. It\u2019s not like I have a life or plans.\n        So, I actually don\u2019t have plans, per se. Not in the sense of going to an elaborate holiday gathering, however, I was looking forward to my small plans. Tonight, I was to go home, change into my Frosty the Snowman pajamas, put my favorite holiday movie (Frosty the Snowman) on, open a bottle of wine, and order Chinese food for my dog and I. \n        But, did anyone get me the copy? Noooooooooooooo, I say to myself like a two-year-old in my head. I look down at the first page. Brutal. This does not bode well for my evening. I want to stick my tongue out at it. \n        It\u2019s now eight at night. The office is mostly empty, except for a few sad souls like myself, who are also the victims of Monsieur Le Khaki. I\u2019m returning to my desk after running downstairs to meet the delivery person bringing my dinner. I sit down behind my desk and open my container of Chinese food. I\u2019m more hungry than I realize, as I dig in with the wooden chopsticks. However, it doesn't taste the same without my dog staring at me with her big eyes, longing for a bite. She has eyes that are always filled with the ever present spark of hope that I will drop a piece, and it will be hers. I do of course drop a piece right onto the copy. Nice one, Karen. Focus. \n        Why does it have to be so boring? Ugh. It\u2019s such a slog. I take a chopstick and stab a cold dumpling. I look back at the page, munching the dumpling, and decide there is nothing good here and many, many pages to go. Yet, I must only say positive things about what I am reading, because that is the rule for documents coded blue. I let out a sigh. My eyes start to close, I blink and focus on the dancing black upon the page. The letters look like they are doing the Can-can. I start to imagine they are dancing to Frosty the Snowman.\n        Suddenly, my office door is thrown open with a resounding crash. I look over and there are men in uniform demanding that I get up immediately. Their uniforms are not any that I recognize. The color is a stark, cold blue. Their look is complete with black woolen caps, and huge machine guns in their arms. I\u2019m told to put my coat on and follow them. Leave my bag, I won\u2019t be needing it. I barely have my coat on when one of them roughly grabs my arm and pushes me out the door. My favorite green and red checkered scarf falls lifelessly to the floor.\n        As I\u2019m marched through the hall, there are papers littering the floor. Sounds of screams, pleadings, the words march, banging, and loud booted footsteps fill the air. They merge into a horrific symphony that I can\u2019t block out. The looks on my colleagues' faces mirror my own; confusion and terror. \n        We are ushered into the back of what resembles a military truck. Two armed guards sit at the end of the truck where the opening is. Cold December air rushes in as the truck pulls away. Someone begins to ask questions, but the command \u201csilence\u201d halts the voice. We sit in terror, each of us looking down at our laps. We are afraid to make eye contact. \n        My head starts to feel heavy. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m struggling to stay awake in this cold truck that jostles me every few moments. I\u2019m not sure how much time has passed, but we are now being violently and quickly unloaded from the truck. Those that fall are kicked and harshly yanked back up. \n        We are pushed into the back of what looks like a cargo plane. All of us are seated on the floor against a wall. Armed guards surround us. I have never felt this cold. We sit for what seems like hours, and then suddenly the back door is closed. The plane begins to move. There are no windows near us, but eventually the plane picks up speed and I feel us taking off. No one tries to talk. We all look at our laps.\n        I startle awake as the plane lurches to one side. My ears are popping. It seems that we are descending. I feel the plane wheels make contact with the ground. We are quickly taken off the plane and put in the back of a military truck. I can\u2019t see anything as the world is completely blanketed in snow.  My face is sore from the harsh flakes that hit it on the way to the next truck.\n         The uniformed guards are once again herding us out of the truck and through a blizzard. I can\u2019t see anything. After a long walk, I\u2019m pushed into a tent. I stumble and full upon the uneven tarp covered flooring. I sit up sore and stiff from the cold and brutal travel conditions. There is a dim camping light hanging from the center of the large triangular tent I\u2019m in. Snow drifts in from the unsealed flaps of the entrance. The wind is harsh enough that a little pile is already forming. I\u2019m cold, alone in this tent, and I have no idea what is happening or why. \n        As I watch the snow swirl in, I realize no one knows that I am gone except the people that were taken with me. No one will know to check on my dog. The thought makes me double over in agony, I can\u2019t stop sobbing. \n        \u201cHaaaaaaaapy Birthday!\u201d I hear a happy, jolly voice exclaim. I turn my head and see a white figure in front of the opening of the tent. I begin to wonder if this is the first stage of hypothermia. Perhaps, I\u2019m becoming delusional. My throat must be frozen because I can\u2019t seem to speak. \n        The white figure then says with some concern, \u201cAre you cold, Karen? Now that's a silly question. You wouldn't be sneezing if you weren't cold.\u201d\n        I didn\u2019t sneeze. I don\u2019t think I sneezed. Wait, Frosty says that line in the television show. Is this how everything ends for me? I\u2019m alone in a tent freezing, I don\u2019t know where I am or why I am here. I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s happening to my colleagues. My dog is alone at home without anyone to feed her. And, what do I hear? I hear the voice of Frosty the Snowman. \n        If I\u2019m dying, shouldn\u2019t I hear something more inspiring? Shouldn\u2019t my life flash before my eyes? No, of course not, I hear Frosty. Maybe this is all because I ate a bad dumpling, I hopefully think as I begin to cry again.\n        I hear Frosty say, \u201cOhh, don't cry, Karen.\u201d\n        Great, now all I need is to find out that the armed guards in blue are actually foot soldiers of the evil magician whose hat brought Frosty to life. My thoughts are swirling in my head as violently as the snow outside. It is hard for me to understand what is real, and what is just running through my mind. Nevertheless I want to get up and walk over to the blurry white figure, but I\u2019m unable to move. My body is too stiff from the cold.\n        My gaze stays fixed on the blurry figure that starts to approach me slowly. Frosty leans down and removes a red woolen scarf from his neck and wraps it around mine. My eyes begin to flutter closed, such a dangerous thing in this cold.\n        I hear the narrator in my head saying, \u201cI suppose it all started with the snow. You see, it was a very special kind of snow. A snow that made the happy happier, and the giddy even giddier. A snow that'd make a homecoming homier, and natural enemies into friends, naturally. For it was the first snow of the season.\u201d\n        There is a loud chomping sound that awakens me. I look over and my dog\u2019s nose is stuck in a Chinese food container. She glances at me with questioning eyes over the white box with red lettering. I hear music, \u201cFrosty the Snowman is a fairy tale, they say.\u201d It\u2019s from the television. Of course, holiday shows are playing. It was only a dream! I\u2019m home with my dog, I realize with relief. \n        No, this is a nightmare. There is a harsh push at my back. I\u2019ve been taken from the tent and find myself once again in a truck with my colleagues. Two are missing, and their spaces are filled with more armed guards. The truck lurches forward as snow swirls into the back. This is terrifying. I\u2019m exhausted and know this is my reality. I just want Frosty back. \n        The narrator\u2019s voice once again fills my mind, \u201cFrosty realized that Karen had to get out of that car as soon as possible. So when the little freight train stopped to let an express full of happy Christmas travelers pass, Frosty took advantage of the opportunity and quickly got them all out.\u201d \n        Alas, there is no Frosty to save Karen.

We had been fighting a Civil War across the country for nearly twenty years. I was a twenty-eight-year-old army sergeant leading a team of men through the streets of the capital, Washington, DC, for the final push to topple the rebel government once and for all. \n        I had grown up in an isolated community in rural Mississippi, in the remnants of the United States. At this point, we were no longer states but rather a confederation of Communities. The Rebels had ruled most major cities along the east and west coasts for years, with only a few exceptions. Decades of isolation and then warfare took their toll on our communities, and by the time I was born, everything was scarce. Rolling blackouts and boiling water orders were the norm. Most cities are chaotic spaces filled with immense wealth but also immense poverty. Life was fast and short in the urban landscape. In rural America, life seemed more manageable. Many of these urban areas and even some of the larger towns were dissolved and reformed into communes. Everyone in these communes had a purpose and a function. As long as you worked and followed the rules, you were fed and given shelter. My father worked as a mechanic in a garage in our commune, while my mother was a night nurse at the local clinic.\n        By the time I was eight years old, political resentment had reached a boiling point. Every day that school year, I came home and heard my parents and grandparents yelling at the dinner table about the corrupt government that had taken over our country. At school, the teachers in our history classes would lecture us on how, in our weakened state sixty years ago, the Rebels had infiltrated our hallowed halls in Washington. On Sundays in church, the preacher would call on us to pray for the souls of the Rebel factions, who were on a fast track to hell if they did not get right with the Lord. I never asked many questions about this narrative. There was never any reason to ask questions. That was simply the history I was told. That year, our leaders officially declared war on the Rebel Government.\n        I joined my local militia group when I turned eighteen, along with all of my school friends. We were shipped out to Fort Benning, Georgia, for training and then sent up north to where the bulk of the fighting was taking place. For the last ten years, I have fought in Boston, upstate New York, and more recently, northern Virginia. Then, last week, we received word that the capital was expected to fall.\n        My unit was tasked with clearing out various government buildings of rebel holdouts along Pennsylvania Avenue. The bigwig Generals had already taken the Capitol building and the White House and, of course, arrested various rebel leaders, trotting them out in handcuffs as prisoners of war with much public fanfare.\n        We had entered the city from the west. Arlington Bridge had been burned, but Roosevelt Bridge still stood. We walked past various monuments, and the new recruits stood in awe. Many of them had never seen anything as tall as the Washington Monument. Soon, we stopped next to a large granite building severely damaged by artillery shells. We had to crawl beneath a collapsed pillar one at a time to enter. When we got inside, we found a large hallway with beautiful marble floors. Each time we entered these buildings, I was both enthralled and appalled by the wealth on display. I thought of the sheer cost of the marble being scuffed underneath my boots. I also thought of the children who went hungry each night on the streets all across the country and could not reconcile these two things. \n        The elevators were not working, so we made our way up the stairs slowly, keeping our guard up around each corner. The building seemed to be empty. Upstairs, we found some conference rooms and then a massive crater. Singed papers and burned book covers fell beneath our feet and through to the floors below. We made our way back down to the basement, preparing ourselves for a firefight. If any Rebels remained in this building, their best stronghold would be on the bottom level. My man on point moved around the last corner of the stairs and drew his gun.\n        We entered the basement and were confronted with stack after stack of shelves filled to the brim with boxes, files, papers, and various books. Some of the books were extremely large, perhaps two feet in length. Many of them showed signs of water damage, while the boxes were newer. Some boxes were labeled in scrawling, handwritten cursive, while others had yellowing cards with black typeface letters describing their content taped to them.\n        Suddenly, my point man threw back his left hand to us, gesturing us to pause, and directed his weapon towards his right, yelling out, \u201cDrop your weapon now, or I will open fire!\u201d \n        He hesitated for a moment and then shots rang out. Just as quickly as the bullets flew, they ceased. Suddenly, the soldier looked back at me, panicked.\n        \u201cShe had a gun, Sergeant.\u201d\n        I looked over at the target to see two people lying wounded on the ground. \n        An elderly woman with gnarled, arthritic fingers lay in a pool of blood behind a stack of books, now toppled over beside her. We stopped in shock. It was not often that we saw people of such a tremendous age, much less this close to the front lines. She had been shot point-blank in the chest. A small handgun lay at her side. Next to her, a woman no more than my age was dragging herself away from us with one arm while desperately pulling a box with the other. I pointed my gun at her and told her to stop. She lifted her hands shakily. She had been shot just below the knee and was losing a great deal of blood. As one soldier handcuffed her hands behind her back, I had my medic tie a tourniquet to her leg before taking her out of the building. I used the end of my rifle to tip the lid of the box to the floor and peered inside. It seemed to be filled with some papers, envelopes, and a few old bound books among other things. The contents looked much like the rest of the stuff in stacks all over this room. Why would these women risk their lives to protect this stuff?\n        I would have to turn the box over to my commanding officer back at base camp. But first, I had some questions for this woman. \n        We had made our base camp in Arlington Cemetery. The lack of a bridge and access to water provided a great point of operation for the various units moving across the city. The woman had been treated for her wounds in the medical tent, but she had said virtually nothing to the doctors there. She was brought into my tent in a wheelchair. I noted her appearance in more detail now. Her skin was a deep mahogany. Her hair was cut short and worn naturally. She had large, deeply set, round brown eyes.  I had my men place some of the materials from the box on a card table between us. She stared at the objects as if she had seen a ghost. \n        \u201cOk Ma'am. Now is your chance. Speak clearly and plainly, because after this meeting, I will be handing you over to central command, and they are not as good at listening as I am. So first things first: What is all the stuff that was in this box?\u201d I waved my hand over the table and looked at her. \n        She looked at me. Her lip quivered slightly as she spoke. \u201cIt is everything you could not burn.\u201d \n        My brow furrowed at this statement. I waited for her to continue.\n        \u201cSo far, every time your people have entered a city and taken it, they burn everything they leave behind them. Why do you think that is?\u201d The woman sat back in her chair and crossed her arms. \n        I scoffed. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that, Ma\u2019am. That sounds like something the Rebels might do, but not us.\u201d \n        Now it was the woman\u2019s turn to furrow her brow. \u201cSir, I\u2019m a little confused here, but who exactly do you think you are?\u201d\n        I shook my head, wondering if this woman had lost more blood than I thought. \u201cWe are the remnants of the US government. We have been fighting to take back our country ever since you Rebels took it from us sixty years ago.\u201d\n        The woman covered her face with her hands and spoke through her fingers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t rebel against you. You rebelled against us. I am sorry, we all know your communes were not exposed to any documentary or historic materials related to the conflict. But this false narrative is still difficult to hear firsthand.\u201d\n        The woman leaned forward now, throwing her hands expressively as she spoke. \u201cI will tell you the truth now, though you will likely not believe it. We have been fighting this horrible conflict for as long as I can remember. The Rebel Confederation broke away from the United States of America sixty years ago, forming their own collection of communities way out across the nation in rural, isolated areas. And that seemed to work for a long time. But when things went bad, they still went bad everywhere. Climate change, inflation, and natural disasters. They hit everyone hard. We tried to come to some peaceful agreement, but disputes over water and resources boiled over into an all-out war twenty years ago. We have been fighting ever since.\u201d\n        I looked down at my lap and thought about my childhood. I thought about the limited reading materials we had access to. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it until this very moment. Sure, we learned the basics of history related to the United States and the world more broadly, but it fit so neatly with our community's view. It aligned so cleanly against any outside perspectives. \n        I glanced around the table and started to really look at what was in front of me. A collection of letters bound in red ribbon and signed by George Washington was on my right. In front of me was an assortment of legal papers with the names of various Native American tribes on them. To my left sat a long scroll of parchment that began with the phrase, \u201cIn Congress, July 4, 1776\u2026\u201d I picked the box up and pulled out a few more items: a bus pass with the name Rosa Parks inside; a gray rock in a Ziploc bag labeled \u201cApollo 11;\u201d a set of weather-worn journals with the names Meriwether Lewis and William Clark engraved on the spines. [8] \n        It finally dawned on me what building we had cleared that morning. I said, \u201cMa\u2019am, who was the old woman that was killed by my men today?\u201d\n        \u201cHer name was Sarah Anderson. She was the Chief Archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration of the United States,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n        \u201cI am Jill Franklin, and I am a historian,\u201d she replied softly.\n        \u201cBut why? I understand that these materials are of historical significance, but why risk your life for them?\"\n        Jill Franklin, a historian of American history, smiled and said, \u201cBecause... these materials are all we were, all we never wish to return to, and all we ever wish we could be. They represent the best and the worst of us. They are, in a sense, us.\u201d\n        At that moment, a soldier came into the tent and spoke. \u201cSir, Colonel Hutchinson has requested to speak with the prisoner.\u201d\n        \u201cGo ahead then,\u201d I replied.\n        As the soldier wheeled Jill out of the tent, her chair knocked one of the papers from the table to the ground. I bent down and picked it up. It was a long, yellow scroll, signed by Abraham Lincoln and embossed with the great seal of the United States. I read the first few lines:\n        That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.

It was not a particularly challenging assignment. All they had to do was replicate the biological genome of an organic matter of their choice, and they were allowed to use their collab-AI. However, the boys had been procrastinating for weeks. They were still debating whether to replicate a cannabis plant, Mercutio\u2019s idea, or a rose, Romeo\u2019s.\n        Romeo had an image of the flower pulled up on his projection screen.\n        \u201cCoz, what do you even need the rose for? At least cannabis has a purpose,\u201d Mercutio asked him through bites of his protein bar.\n        \u201cYou know why,\u201d Romeo said, rolling his eyes at his friend.\n        \u201cYou want to give it to Rosaline.\u201d\n        \u201cYup.\u201d\n        \u201cBecause of her name.\u201d\n        \u201cExactly.\u201d\n        \u201cYou are such a dork.\u201d Mercutio laughed as he unwrapped another protein packet. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time in the archives. Giving a girl a flower to tell her that you like her is old-order.\u201d\n        Romeo smiled at him. \u201cI have an old-order soul,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cYou know, even if we code the rose, and even if we get it right, and even if Roselyn likes it, and even if she decides that she likes it so much that she is willing to overlook your extraordinary dorkiness and actually go out with you, it still won\u2019t work.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Romeo said, for the first time actually paying attention.\n        \u201cBecause Rosaline\u2019s family just got demoted to working class D. She got kicked out of university this morning.\u201d\n        \u201cShut up! For real?\u201d Romeo said, suddenly distraught.\n        \u201cFor real.\u201d\n        Romeo groaned and slammed his projection screen on the table, shutting it off. Mercutio snickered, rolled the protein wrapper into a ball. He threw it at Romeo, hitting him in the head. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry coz. It\u2019s a known fact. All the hot girls are in D or lower.\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculous. Do you think Mom would be so weird about me dating outside of my rank if she weren\u2019t running for leadership promotion?\u201d\n        \u201cCoz, your Mom is weird about everything. Didn\u2019t you see her new post?\u201d\n        \u201cOh no. How bad?\u201d\n        Mercutio handed his screen to Romeo, with an apologetic shrug. He had clicked open on a new press post which projected an image of Romeo\u2019s stern looking mother at a podium. When Romeo swiped up, his mother\u2019s familiar, booming voice filled the room. \u201cTo answer your question, yes. My team and I fully support proposition HB8,000 to remove legal protections for those in inter-status marriages.\u201d\n        Romeo slammed Mercutio\u2019s screen on the table next to his own.\n        \u201cHey!\u201d Mercutio protested, but he changed his tone when he saw Romeo\u2019s face. It was an expression that looked more frightened than angry.\n        \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Romeo said this quietly.\n        Mercutio playfully punched Romeo\u2019s arm and casually said, \u201cCoz, don\u2019t sweat it. It\u2019s just politics.\u201d\n        \u201cIt is people\u2019s lives. This is going to rip apart families. My own mother!

You in?\u201d \n        Romeo looked at his goofy, best friend who was willing to risk everything without a thought. He was young, careless, and joyful. If anyone could survive in a world governed by these fearful and oppressive adults who made such absurd and cruel choices, it was Mercutio. \u201cYeah, bud,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d"}

A figure darted and weaved through the press of bodies. Each time the lights streaked over the figure, they jerked to the side, slamming through more people. As all the beams began to converge on the figure, they slipped into a side alley.\n        With the break from the crowd, the figure, a young man in his late teens, managed to shake the searchlights. The helicopters that cast them into the crowds couldn\u2019t follow into the alley. It was sealed from the top, just another victim of poor urban planning in The City. So now it was less an alley and more another hallway through the gargantuan superstructure that was home. The man scampered up and around fallen obstacles taller than him until he eventually found his way to a nondescript part of the wall. He grabbed a part of it and slipped the painted cover out of the way, revealing a crack in the side of the metal wall. He slipped inside.\n        Inside was complete darkness. At least, until the man reached up and tapped a holo-light in the ceiling. The light illuminated the small alcove. But more importantly, it allowed the man to see a small handle set into the ground. He reached over and pulled on it, which revealed a sloping pit. With no hesitation, he slipped into the slide. \n        Gravity took hold and the man slid through the emptiness. The speed made the trip exhilarating, no matter how many times he took it. He never quite got used to the length, though. Every time, a wild thought would cross his mind. What if something had happened while he was gone? What if the slide had broken or bent, and he would suddenly find himself plummeting straight down into nothingness? Yet every time he would come sliding to the bottom, tussled but unharmed.\n        The slide let out into the man\u2019s true home. Back a few decades, a corporation had decided to construct an extensive office slab built deep underground. Naturally, it was built quickly, cheaply, and poorly. The corporation fell under almost immediately after construction finished, leaving the whole place an abandoned and half collapsed ruin. Prefabricated rooms ran together in an endless procession of identical office drabness. Except in places where the man and his family had improved things.\n        A woman around the same age as the man slipped into the room. \n        \u201cTorren! Welcome back. Did you get it?\u201d she asked. \n        Torren smiled and pulled something from his bulky coat. It was a bag full of a bizarre assortment of things. Groceries, knick-knacks, a bit of everything.\n        \u201cYes, Meg, yes I did. That and more. We\u2019ve got actual bread, another line of code breakers, and most importantly, lady products that I\u2019m not allowed to ask about,\u201d Torren said.\n        As he did, he laid out each of the items in question on a blanket. Meg moved over and snatched up the bread. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s been WAY too long since I had something like this. If I had to eat another nutrient bar, I swear I\u2019d go crazy,\u201d Meg said. \n        \u201cNot just that,\u201d Torren said.

The lava sounded like breaking glass, and the overpowering smell of sulfur made this once peaceful escape a true Hell on Earth.\n        The rivers of lava demonstrated nature\u2019s staggering force. However, they were nothing compared to the ash plumes towering thousands of miles in the air. Embers rained down from the sky, forming a thick blanket of ash that stretched as far south as Colorado and as far east as Minnesota. Life was extinguished in these enveloped areas. Those spared suffocation watched in awe as an eerie red haze obstructed the sun.\n        For Adonai, Doomsday arrived six weeks too early to fulfill his prophecy. He had made dozens of predictions since he formed the House of Adonai thirty years ago. The sect was largely unknown until a clip of one of his hours-long rants went viral online. The tall, lanky man testified that he was divinely appointed to save the chosen ones. Those who followed would be transported to a new astral plane before the impending apocalypse on August 26, 2038. The dregs of society would be left to suffer the collapse of humankind. \n        Monica Harris was one of the many that couldn't get enough of Adonai\u2019s melodic voice and mesmerizing eyes. To most, he was a laughingstock. However, his message struck a chord with plenty of people. Some flocked to the Children of Adonai\u2019s compound in the New Mexico desert. Monica\u2019s curiosity outweighed her skepticism. She, too, began her journey out west. Within a month, his flock of forty people had more than doubled.\n        Increased seismic activity beginning in March had geologists issuing warnings of the imminent danger. Panic ensued, and vulnerable people found solace in Adonai\u2019s promises. By the time Yellowstone Caldera erupted on July 11, 2038, the compound was bursting with close to two hundred followers. \n        The clouds of volcanic ash remained in the air for a year. This triggered an extended winter. Crops failed, air travel came to a standstill, and resources became scarce. The government crumbled quickly.  As a response to the soaring crime, municipalities became authoritarian systems, imprisoning people in their own cities. \n        Monica listened to the stories about life outside the compound from weary outcasts seeking refuge. The Children of Adonai was structured and a little more woo woo than she would like. Nonetheless, she appreciated the sense of community. The members were attentive and complementary, a stark contrast to other groups.\n        It took great organization to keep the group of two hundred sheltered and fed. Every minute of Monica\u2019s day was scheduled. She woke up at 5:00 AM to help prepare breakfast for the group. Once they were finished serving and cleaning up after breakfast, it was time to start preparing lunch. Meditation and reflection time was scheduled for the afternoon. The Children of Adonai had been stockpiling supplies for years in preparation for doomsday. Though they were better off than many, the increased number of members strained their resources. Food had to be rationed, so rather than eating dinner, they were nourished with Adonai\u2019s divine insight. \n        Adonai held court for hours in the evening. He droned on about being a divine prophet and how they were chosen to exalt him and carry out his earthly mission. He spoke mainly in platitudes. Monica was drawn to his charisma, but she soon realized his words had no substance. She slept only four hours a night, so she would zone out as Adonai droned on and on and on. The commune had not delivered on its promises, but she felt it was safer than life on the outside.\n        Monica hoped she might develop more friendships being part of the group. The days were so packed with work and lectures, there was little time to socialize. Adonai declared their most important relationship was with him and discouraged any other relationships, romantic or platonic. So, it was surprising that Adonai introduced a new system when members would be paired up to protect the integrity of the cult. Rumors swirled that this was just a way to encourage ratting on each other. Monica was still excited to have the companionship.\n        Monica was paired with Gretchen, a newer member that had climbed the ranks. She was well liked among the other members, and they considered her an ally in the inner circle. Despite her closeness to Adonai, she worked hard and seemed more grounded than the other higher ups. Still, Monica watched her words carefully around Gretchen.\n        Rules became stricter and rations smaller. Adonai feared unrest. He promised that he would punish dissenters and make an example out of them. Likewise, people that revealed nonconformists would be rewarded with power and luxuries. Members that were not loyal were forced to wear all black so that they were easily identifiable. Multiple or serious infractions resulted in offenders being isolated for hours or even days in sensory deprivation rooms.\n        The perk of being matched with a higher up is that she was moved from working in the kitchen to the less tedious task of mending clothes. Monica and Gretchen spent hours sewing together each day. They started off talking about their lives before the eruption and the things they missed. Their conversations made the time fly for the first time since Monica arrived. Monica and Gretchen developed a mutual trust of each other.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re cool, right?\u201d Gretchen asked Monica one afternoon. \n        \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Monica asked, tearing a thread with her teeth.\n        \u201cLike, if I confided in you, you wouldn\u2019t rat me out?\u201d\n        \u201cOh, yeah, no!\u201d Monica said loudly. \n        Gretchen raised her finger to her lips. Monica lowered her voice. \u201cYeah, I'm totally cool.\u201d\n        Gretchen leaned in to Monica. \u201cWhat do you think of Adonai\u2019s lectures?\u201d\n        \u201cUmm, they\u2019re fine,\u201d Monica said.\n        Gretchen rolled her eyes.\n        \u201cAlright. They\u2019re unbearable.\u201d Monica laughed.\n        \u201cRight? It\u2019s a lot sometimes,\u201d said Gretchen.\n        Monica nodded. \u201cHe just drones on and on. He\u2019s not even saying anything. Most of the time, I just tune it out.\"\n        They laughed and continued to gossip about the ridiculous rules and the impossible schedules. Sleep deprivation and hunger clouded Monica\u2019s judgment. She had seldom let her guard down. However, it felt so good getting this off her chest. Finally, having someone to share her feelings with made her optimistic she could make it until things got better.\n        Monica felt lighter and almost skipped back to Adonai\u2019s evening lecture. She couldn\u2019t wait to see Gretchen at tonight\u2019s talk. It was exciting to have someone to commiserate with. When she arrived, she searched the room for Gretchen, but she was nowhere to be found. The members were called to settle, and Monica found a seat. \n        Adonai entered the room. Following closely behind him was Gretchen. Seeing Gretchen in such close proximity to Adonai made Monica feel uneasy. She flashed back to their conversation earlier in the day, They were friends though. She could be trusted, couldn\u2019t she? Monica\u2019s heart raced, and her palms began to sweat. Gretchen smiled at her from the stage. Monica bit her lip and gave her a nervous smile in return.\n        Adonai sat cross-legged on his pedestal. He began his lecture. His topic for the evening was loyalty. Monica sank in her seat as he launched an angry diatribe against people that turned their backs on him. After he preached for a solid hour, he stood up and motioned to someone at the back of the room.\n        Two large guards at the back of the room marched forward and stood right behind Monica. She wanted to run, but she was frozen in fear, \n        \u201cLet this be a lesson to anyone that thinks of betraying me,\u201d Adonai said, staring sternly at Monica. \n        The guards lifted Monica by her arms. She let out a scream. \u201cNo, no, please, no! It was a mistake! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Her pleas faded in the lecture hall as Monica was dragged kicking to the sensory deprivation chamber.\n        Three days passed, and Monica was finally released. She walked outside wearing a black t-shirt and black pants. The sun shining through the red haze blinded her. As she adjusted to the outside, she looked up. Gretchen stood in Adonai\u2019s window, sipping wine and eating chocolate. It was a luxury given to the most devout. Monica didn\u2019t have the strength to muster any emotion. Gretchen looked down at her former confidant and couldn\u2019t hold back her smug smile. She waved at Monica and took a sip of her wine. \n"}

The grasses were tall, and the purple, white and yellow flowers were bright in the midday light.\n        Irx stared into the sky for another minute. \u201dLet\u2019s go,\u201d he growled.\n        The pair dashed across the open space. \n        Halfway across, Diwo froze for a moment and looked up. \n        Did a shadow fall across the ground? \n        Nothing in the sky. A streak of clouds. He ran to catch up.\n        There were fields of leafy greens there, growing wild. \n        Lettuce, cabbage, even spinach! Beets...  ew, I don\u2019t like beets. And trees? Is that? It is! A nectarine tree! Diwo ran to it and breathed in deeply. Nectarines, all over the ground! He chomped down on one that didn\u2019t look too bruised. He moaned with delight as the sweet juice filled his mouth.\n        \u201cHey!\u201d a voice called out. \u201cThat one\u2019s mine!\u201d\n        Diwo looked up. He mumbled something around a mouthful of fruit.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d the figure said, shadowed in the branches of the tree. It jumped to the ground, landed gracefully and two-stepped over to a scattering of fruit nearby.\n        Diwo spit out the fruit in his mouth. \u201cI said, I didn\u2019t know anyone was here.\u201d\n        \u201cWell,\u201d said the gatherer. \u201cI am here. Prrrrrr. My name is Sabra.\u201d She smiled and blinked rapidly as she collected the nectarines. Hands with sharp claws retrieved the fruit quickly and deposited them in a leather pouch tied around her waist. Still looking at Diwo, she licked the back of her hands, long claws retracting. \n        Diwo realized he was staring at a female. \u201cI am Diwo.\u201d\n        Sabra\u2019s long tail twitched. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Her eyes darted around. \u201cWhere is the rest of your kennel, prrrrr?\u201d\n        That sound made the hair on his back stand up. Excitement? Fear? Diwo did not know. \u201cOh, we have traveled most of the morning. We are looking for new territory.\u201d\n        Sabra\u2019s face twisted, and her eyes grew wide. \u201cThis place is mine.\u201d\n        Diwo noticed that Sabra\u2019s long tail curled and moved with complexity. What was the word he had heard? Prehensile?\n        Diwo spent a moment regarding his own stubby tail which did little, when a sound at the far end of the valley of rock pillars drew his attention. A strange sound started, then it ended just as quickly. Sabra also stared in that direction, motionless, listening.\n        \u201cDiwo!\u201d\n        Diwo looked around and saw Irx running towards them from across the field, carrying a sack of leafy greens.\n        \u201cDiwo, run!\u201d\n        Diwo looked over at Sabra with alarm. \u201cWhere is the rest of your clowder?\u201d\n        Sabra hissed and stuffed a few more nectarines in her pouch before tying it. \u201cI prefer to hunt alone!\u201d \n        \u201cDiwo!\u201d Irx was halfway across the field when a bolt of lightning shot out, and the ground exploded around him. \n        \u201cIrx!\u201d Diwo started to run to him, but Sabra grabbed his leg.\n        \u201cNo! This way!\u201d\n        \u201cBut Irx!\u201d Diwo shouted.\n        \u201cIrx is gone. Come on!\u201d\n        The ground trembled, and another bolt struck the nectarine tree, splitting the top in two. Diwo ran to follow Sabra. They fled into a gap in one of the pillars. \n        Diwo hesitated and looked at the concrete and stone that rose so high he couldn\u2019t see the top. Straight into the sky. \n        \u201cCome on!\u201d Sabra urged.\n        Diwo took one more look back. He could see where Irx lay, unmoving. He could smell blood and death. Then he slipped inside.\n\n        Stomp adjusted the shard over his right shoulder. The armored battle suit should have fit together seamlessly, but the right shoulder plate never fit correctly. \n        The damn thing is too tight.\n        He adjusted the strap around his rail gun so it rubbed against the loose shard a bit less, and he scanned the open field. \n        A second battle suit walked by, the micro-engines in the legs and arms humming to make the stride seem effortless.\n        Stomp\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom to his partner, Thumper. \u201cSee anything?\u201d \n        Thumper flexed his proboscis back and forth above his head with an all-clear signal.\n        They walked another five meters before Thumper\u2019s trunk stood straight up. \n        Stomp saw it then. The body lay in the smoking crater.\n        \u201cThese are primitives. They\u2019re still living in caves out here,\u201d Thumper scoffed.\n        \u201cYeah, well, our job is to clear it out.\u201d Stomp took the rail gun off his shoulder and held it at his side. That feels better. \u201cWe\u2019ll take down these structures with charges and clear the rubble to atoms from the air. By this time tomorrow, there will be a new highway coming straight through here. The herd will have a new city to build.\u201d He trumpeted proudly.\n        Thumper looked around. \u201cAll these tall stone monoliths were built by monkeys?\u201d\n        Stomp looked at him with irritation. \u201cThey were called buildings. Built by humans.\u201d\n        Thumper shrugged. \u201cWhatever. They\u2019re dead now.\u201d He took a bag from around his shoulder, opened it, and took out a blast disc.\n        \u201cThey\u2019re not dead. They left.\u201d\n        \u201cSame thing.\u201d Thumper tossed the disc into the air. It sailed and stuck to the face of a nearby building, worn by time down to its concrete and rock base. He threw another in the opposite direction. It stuck to the face of another building.\n        \u201cReady?\u201d Stomp asked.\n        \u201cSure,\u201d Thumper said. He threw his sack over his shoulder. \u201cSay, did you see what I saw? Those two running into the \u2014 what did you call it \u2014 building?\u201d\n        \u201cYeah. It's better we clear this place out. Primitives like that can spread disease.\u201d\n        Thumper\u2019s proboscis twitched in disgust. \u201cDogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria.\u201d"}
{"example_id":"example_049","inputs":"Write a story that is set in a dystopian world. The story\u2019s main character, Nova, is eleven years old and living in Nation U (which stands for Nation Universe), an oppressive government. Everyone in Nation U is meant to serve the government and their president, President Roberts. Starting at age seventeen, all children are supposed to join Arcadia, a branch of government. The colors for all the homes in Nation U, as well as the clothing, are black, white, and gray. Each house is boxy with the same amount of rooms - three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, and a sitting room. The streets are lined with cameras and everyone is required to wear a tracker bracelet. The children\u2019s studies are all about serving President Roberts and Nation U, including \u201csocial hours,\u201d which are lessons they attend every Sunday with Mrs. Jones. After one social hour, Nova runs off. The cameras are watching her and her tracker begins beeping. She hears sirens in the distance. She crosses the border and finds a small alley and a small apartment full of band posters and watercolor paintings. Nova meets Jimmy in an apartment. He helps her take her bracelet off while telling her more about Nation U. The next day, Nova suggests to the other children that they stop the government. The story should be around 1800-1900 words. \n","targets":"        Nova looked out the window of the school bus, the black edges and corners lined with frost. She watched as the large, loud vehicle flew by each dull house. No home was bigger than the other, they all followed the same basic floor plan - three bedrooms, a kitchen, two bathrooms, and a sitting room. Nation U was built on mediocrity\u2014the idea that if everything's the same, then everyone is equal, and there will be no war or ill will toward anyone. Nova closed her eyes and listened to the faint voices of the other kids, speaking of President Roberts and eventually moving up to Arcadia, the branch of government that everyone seventeen and older was expected to join. Nova wasn\u2019t interested in becoming a member of Arcadia or any branch of government, at least not under the supervision of Nation U and President Roberts. But she didn\u2019t have a choice. No one did. \n        The kids filed into their classes, one by one. Each classroom had a photo of President Roberts, the Nation U\u2019s flag, and a poster with the country\u2019s anthem written on it. The flag was colorless, achromatic, and soulless. It held the most boring hues of gray, black, and white - Nation U\u2019s colors. Every school-aged child was required to wear uniforms in the same blanched assortment. Black pleated skirts or pants, white socks and collared shirts, black shoes, and gray blazers. After the teacher\u2019s announcements, President Roberts would appear on the large, flat, plasma screen each room had, and the kids would stand and sing Nation U\u2019s anthem to him. \n        \u201cNation U has become the foundation\n        For countries behind to follow\n        U stands for Universe\n        And we will never be cursed\n        We won\u2019t back down\n        Because President Roberts\n        Will always be around.\u201d\n        Nova hated this song, but she knew it was her duty as a citizen to sing it every morning. What she didn\u2019t know was what would happen if she didn\u2019t sing it. But she wasn\u2019t willing to take that risk.\n        After school, the bus, still frosted from the chilled air, drove the children to the corners of their neighborhoods, where they would walk to their uninspired homes. Cameras were perched high on the dim streetlamps, each one twisting and making a ZZZZ sound as it followed every child, always ensuring they weren\u2019t wandering off. Every citizen of Nation U was equipped with a monitoring device, a small bracelet worn on their wrist at all times. If anyone deviated from their daily routines - work or school, home, sleep, social hours on every seventh day - then the bracelet would constantly beep, alerting the blue squad that something was amiss. On this particular day, Nova stopped at her front door. She turned and looked at the streetlamp on the sidewalk, slowly moving her head up so she was staring right at the camera. The camera stared back at her. Then, she went inside. \n        The inside of her home was always chilly, and she narrowed this down to each room being monochromatic to match Nation U\u2019s colors. Her kitchen, equipped with large appliances and basic utensils, felt soulless. Her mother, Misty, was in the kitchen, cooking some chicken and broccoli. \n        \u201cMom, what\u2019s the point of living if everything is the same?\u201d\n        Misty stopped abruptly and turned to look at Nova. \n        \u201cExcuse me, dear? What do you mean, exactly?\"\n        \u201cI mean. Everything is the same. Nobody is different here.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it peaceful, darling. Now go wash your hands for dinner. President Roberts just announced that he\u2019ll be visiting today.\u201d\n        \u201cPresident Roberts? Coming here?\u201d \n        \u201cYes. This is a big deal for your father. He\u2019s been wanting to move up from the Gray Branch for a while. He believes this will be his time to finally move up to the White Branch.\u201d\n        The different branches in Nation U\u2019s government were supposed to symbolize the hierarchy of each family, but instead, they symbolized who President Roberts considered to be the most valuable and loyal to him. Nova walked upstairs to her room and shut the door, irked by the thought of President Roberts visiting her home. \n        That evening, after dinner, Nova joined her family in their sitting room. President Roberts spoke with her father, Michael, about politics, what\u2019s best for Nation U, and whether he agreed with the values and principles that the country was built upon. Every time her father answered with a \u201cyes\u201d or an \u201cabsolutely,\u201d Nova became more and more irritated. Before leaving, President Roberts walked up to Nova, looked her in the eye, and said, \u201cWhat about you? Do you mind if your father joins the White Branch?\u201d Nova looked down, feeling ashamed, and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d \u201cGood. I would hate for your dad to not move up a branch because someone in his family was\u2026questioning things.\u201d  \u201cOf course, sir. No one ever questions anything,\u201d Nova replied slyly. President Roberts laughed and said, \u201cThis is a funny one you\u2019ve got here,\u201d as he walked to the door and got in his large, bulletproof SUV, fully equipped with tinted windows and cameras on the outside. \n        It was Sunday now, and Nova had just arrived home from social hour. During social hour, the children of Nation U were expected to attend lessons about the current government and what was expected of them when they graduated to Arcadia. Arcadia, they said, would be the opening to the rest of their lives; a way for them to ensure that they would never be left in poverty, secure jobs, and ensure their future of happiness within Nation U. At the end of these social hours, they were to discuss with one another which branch of government is their favorite and which one they would want to join. On this particular Sunday, though, Nova stated, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to join any branch of government.\u201d\n        The whole classroom turned to look at her; the faces of her peers surprised and perplexed. How could someone say something so erroneous? \n        \u201cExcuse me, dear? What is it you intend to do, then?\u201d Mrs. Jones, the social hour instructor with frazzled brown hair, a lanky body, and ripped tights, asked Nova. \n        \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t think I want to be a part of the government.\u201d \n        Nova knew this could get her in trouble, but she no longer cared. \n        That evening, as Nova stared out of her window, looking up at the illuminated stars, some of which were filtered out by the highlighted lamps, she wondered what would happen if she just walked away. Nation U had a curfew of 9 PM for every citizen, and it was already past 10, so she would be breaking a law - but she wasn\u2019t sure if she cared anymore. Nova longed to walk outside at night, alone. As she walked down her creaky stairs, spiders gathering in the corners of her house and spinning beautifully shaped webs, she slid on her gray jacket (the words \u201cNATION U\" were perfectly embroidered on the back). Once she got to her front door, she slipped her black boots, one by one, on her feet. Nova opened the door and stepped out onto the porch. \n        As she began walking, she could hear each camera turning, zooming in on her, watching her. The tracking bracelet on her wrist started to beep. It started out slow, and then quickly and constantly, the beep-beep-beep-beeping became louder. Nova didn\u2019t know what to do, but she knew she did not want to turn back. Behind her, she heard faded sirens. \n        Finally, Nova came across an alleyway that she had never seen before. It was dark, with no lamps or cameras. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she was still in Nation U, or if she had crossed a border at some point. The sirens had stopped, but her bracelet was still beeping. As she walked deeper into the alley, she found a small cobblestone square, the wet stones glistening in the moonlight. Nova noticed an extremely faint, flickering light from an abandoned building's basement. She slowly made her way toward the light and descended the stairs, leading her to a heavy, solid door. She pushed the door open with all of her strength and stepped into a sight she had never seen before. \n        This place was painted with colors Nova had only ever seen in the natural world. The walls were a glossy, crimson red. On them hung large pictures of people holding instruments. Another wall held paintings of lovely watercolors - strokes of blues, greens, and pinks. A man walked out of a door to Nova\u2019s right side, softly mumbling to himself. He nearly jumped when he saw her. \n        \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n        \u201cI\u2019m Nova.\u201d\n        \u201cDid they send you here for me?\u201d\n        \u201cSend me here? No, I-I ran away.\u201d\n        The man noticed her tracker beeping and looked down at her wrist. \n        \u201cYou ran away? Do you need help? Want me to take that off?\u201d\n        The man looked disheveled; he had red curly, knotted hair sitting on top of his head, his white shirt had tears and stains, and he wore long, beige shorts with large pockets that Nova had never seen before. \n        \u201cYes. Could you? I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll find me,\u201d Nova responded. \n        \u201cSure. I\u2019m Jimmy,\u201d the man stated. Nova followed him over to a small table that held many different devices. He picked one up and started to drill at her wrist with it. \n        \u201cWill this hurt?\u201d\n        \u201cNo, but we\u2019ll need to make sure we smash it once it\u2019s off of you.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\n        \u201cThis is The Lair. I\u2019ve been here for years. Trying to stop Nation U and that president of yours.\u201d \n        Nova\u2019s heart began to pound. \n        \u201cYou see, a long time ago, the people controlling Nation U overtook what was once a free world. Everything was beautiful and bright. People could listen to any music they wanted. They could watch TV.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019ve heard about those,\u201d Nova stated, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never seen one, except for the screens in school.\u201d\n        \u201cNot many people today have. Anyway,\u201d Jimmy kept drilling, \u201cthey took everything from everyone. Burned it all down. Then they built it all up again the way they wanted to. The way they thought it should be. The Roberts family just became hungry for power. They only want people to listen, watch, and worship them. Their indoctrination has worked for far too long. We\u2019re not putting up with it anymore.\u201d\n        Nova looked at Jimmy as he spoke, her eyes twinkling with excitement at the thought that this could be it - someone has been trying to save them. \n        \u201cThere,\u201d Jimmy said, taking the bracelet off her wrist, \u201call done.\u201d He placed the bracelet on the table, picked up a hammer, and smashed it.\n        \u201cBy the way, you\u2019re not in Nation U. This is nowhere. The place in between servitude and freedom.\u201d \n        \u201cI should probably go back. But, I want to help, somehow.\u201d\n        On Monday, Nova filed onto the frosty bus. She looked around at the other children and listened to them speak about turning seventeen and joining Arcadia. She spoke up. \n        \u201cWhat if we stopped them?\u201d \n        Everyone on the school bus turned to look at Nova that day. They were silent. Then they cheered. Nova had become the one to save them.         "}

I sighed in response to his question, closing my eyes. How would I break the impossible news that I wouldn\u2019t be leaving?\n        Leaving isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s the one we all use. We really should say \u201cdying.\u201d Passing on, departing, transcending, or any number of euphemisms are preferable to the ever-casual \u201cleaving,\u201d but it\u2019s this verb that sustains us. A false intention lies behind it, one we convince ourselves of. Just as we convince ourselves that any of this is normal, we convince ourselves we\u2019re leaving of our own volition. People are supposed to die when they\u2019re dead. If we go on to some other unknown land, great. All I know is we weren\u2019t meant to go where so many people end up going \u2013 leaving to.\n        Like everyone else, Damien expects me to go to the After, an online database that acts as a sort of digital afterlife. Everyone uploads themselves to the After - my mother, father, sister, and nearly every friend I\u2019ve ever had. My wife, Jamie, died most recently, but she didn\u2019t really die. Our relationship wasn\u2019t the same, but being able to communicate through the Afterbase and still see her face was better than being completely without her. \n        \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I still feel pretty healthy.\u201d I answered him with a slight laugh, a pathetic one with desperation latent inside it. Don\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t know, I wanted to reply. Damien had been my closest friend for years\u2014the last one I had. I hated to lie to him.\n        I listened to Damien breathing laboriously on the other line. He gave out a humored scoff, nearly as pathetic as my own. \u201cWell, good. But you should get started planning your expiration date. I wanna know! We have to set up a great funeral for you.\u201d\n        When I was growing up, the idea of planning your own funeral was preposterous, a morbid taboo. Now it\u2019s a person\u2019s last celebration, a rite of passage. They cross the spiritual barrier from the mortal coil to the digital world, processed into becoming an official Afterbeing, and they celebrate with the living as well as the dead. Well, the other Afterbeings, I should say. \n        I swallowed, standing up from my sofa and beginning to pace. My rent-controlled apartment had never been cozier; I've spent my whole life curating the interior and remodeling it to be the ultimate living space. Investing in the now, in this living world, gave me many skeptical looks from peers. No one could understand why my home was so comfortable and organized, when my Afterspace was nearly boilerplate. My friends and family spent their lives learning about themselves and marking down every single detail in the Afterbase. They wrote letters, created scans of their daily journals, curated photo albums, uploaded medical and dental records, dream diaries, credit reports, academic marks, and all the recorded history that comprised their recognizable personhood. Log-keeping is a way of life, as it helps shape the Afterself that awaits you. Of course, one could alter details, molding them to fit the version of themselves that they always wanted to be; many did. Some were pleased to leave the details of their bodies behind and become entirely new beings; others wanted to maintain particular stages - namely their youth. However, everyone is ageless in the After. Aging is an obsolete concept. \n        \u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting pretty old.\u201d I muttered, eyeing the idle screen of my Telespeaker. \u201cSo are you.\u201d\n        Damien laughed ruggedly on the other side. I heard glasses clinking in the background, people laughing and cheering - he was always out of the house, always social, even in his seventies. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a long speech from you at my funeral next month!\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t wait, Dame. I'm already on page thirty-five of all your honorable achievements.\u201d\n        He laughed again, this time coughing for a moment too long, and I winced at the sound. He\u2019d been sick for months now, prompting him to make his departure date. I noticed that those who consciously scheduled one would die by that date, no matter what. It was as if they felt they had to make it on time.\n        \u201cAlright, I've gotta get back to my crew, but I\u2019ll call again soon. Let me know when you\u2019re scheduled, I\u2019m so excited for us!\u201d\n        We said goodbye, and I sat alone in my swirl of nervous thoughts before I received another call. The idle screen came to life, and I ran my hands through my thinning hair as I accepted the call. The face that appeared before me smiled brightly.\n         \u201cHi, mom.\u201d I said, mirroring her happiness. She waved.\n        \u201cGreat to see you, hon. I just got back from work. How\u2019s it going?\u201d\n        Ironically, the Afterbase still required its inhabitants to work. It remained a mystery to the living exactly what work consisted of, as Afterbeings weren\u2019t allowed to disclose most details to those in the real world. She told me she was a \"generator\", helping create energy and resources for the Afterbase. How she did this, I never knew. She\u2019d once explained that they held a range of positions, all contributing to the thriving community of the Afterbase. All I knew for certain was that she was happy and that she enjoyed her job. My wife, father, and sister were generators too, and they seemed just as happy. They were all uniformly adamant about their satisfaction each time I brought the subject up, each giving nothing more than the same jovial answer: \u201cIt\u2019s my dream job!\u201d. Having always received this answer verbatim, I stopped asking questions. All I wanted was their happiness, anyway, and they were always happy.\n        Like most Afterbeings, my mother appeared nearly the same as her living self, but with a notably robotic feel to her expressions. The general quality of the Afterbase has improved drastically since its creation in the twenty-forties, but there were some aspects it seemed they\u2019d never be quite successful in ameliorating. Avatars never totally looked like the people they represented, though their voices were accurate if the person had uploaded ample voice footage before they\u2026 left. My mother certainly had.\n        \u201cI\u2019m alright. I just got off the phone with Damien. He wants me to set a date.\u201d\n        Her vacant eyes widened with sudden excitement. \u201cWow! When are you thinking? That\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d\n        I expected nothing less than her immediate approval. Every Afterbeing wants more Afterbeings around them, or so they always insist.\n        \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know. I\u2026\u201d Though I didn't really feel comfortable telling anyone, I yearned to confide in my mom. I could tell her anything since I was very young, and we\u2019d had a special closeness my whole life. Since her passing, we've tried to maintain this dynamic, but like the skeptical members of the living, I've wondered how closely she resembled my \u201cold\u201d mom. The living Afterstaff insist that souls are \"uploaded\" with integrity, that those who \u201cleft\u201d have truly been transferred, supplemented by algorithms and data superior to any \u2018chatbot\u2019 of old - but a nagging feeling plagued me whenever my mother spoke unusually or asked invasive questions about my daily habits, my doctor\u2019s visits, or my energy levels. \n        Despite this, I needed to confide in someone. No one I knew had ever thought to die in lieu of leaving. Everyone leaves, but nobody dies anymore. Not really.\n        I sighed, hesitating before I finally said it. \n        \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll join the After.\u201d\n        No expression registered on her face for a moment. She blinked and then laughed weakly, like I had just laughed on the phone with Damien. \n        \u201cWhy, Armie? Don\u2019t you want to see everyone?\u201d\n        \u201cOf course, but I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n        \u201cBut you\u2019re revitalized in the After!\u201d\n        I sighed. \u201cYes, I understand. But I feel like I\u2019ve had enough. For centuries, everyone lived and died without an After, it was normal.\u201d\n        \u201cThey were lost to history.\u201d She insisted, nearly cutting me off. \u201cIf we'd had the chance to preserve them, the amount of knowledge we\u2019d still have access to would be world-changing! Plus, we\u2019d still be able to talk to our great-great-\u201d\n        \u201cYes, I understand that, mom, but I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just trying to be honest.\u201d\n        She continued smiling. A moment of silence passed before she asked me, \u201cRemember how nervous you were after graduating from high school?\u201d\n        I nodded. It felt like an eternity ago, but I could still remember that helpless, free-falling feeling of having no idea what I wanted to do with my life or where I\u2019d possibly end up. I\u2019d holed up in my room for three weeks after graduation, never leaving the house unless absolutely necessary.\n        \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see what was in store for you. It was scary. You isolated yourself.\u201d\n        \u201cYes, I did.\u201d I replied glumly.\n        \u201cAnd if you trusted that you\u2019d have a bright future, and had you leaned on me, your dad, Bella, or even your friends, you would\u2019ve had a better time, huh?\u201d\n        \u201cYes.\u201d\n        \u201cIf you knew you\u2019d had that paid internship lined up, you would\u2019ve been a lot more hopeful, huh?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, mom.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, then trust me when I say that joining us in the After is just like predicting the future. You have a wonderful life ahead of you, surrounded by your family and friends. What are you waiting for?\u201d\n        Her insistence was unexpected, my living mother was always so supportive if I strayed from the average course. Her phrasing sounded like the recycled lines of a commercial, read coldly in her warm voice.\n        \u201cUntil I feel ready, I guess.\u201d I answered, desperately holding back resentment in my tone.\n        \u201cWell,\u201d She huffed, sounding suddenly like herself, \u201cEveryone needs a date. If you don\u2019t assign one, one is assigned for you!\u201d\n        I sat in our uncomfortable silence, unsure how to explain myself further. I hadn\u2019t ever considered what they did for the people who remained unscheduled, because no one ever did.\n        \u201cHey. Remind me, Armie,\u201d She went on, her voice lowering, \u201cBut haven\u2019t you already passed the standard expiration date?\u201d\n        I swallowed hard. My old mother wouldn\u2019t ask anything like that. I didn\u2019t reply. I wished that I could call Dad or consult my wife, but I suddenly felt more alone than I had in years.\n        Two notifications suddenly appeared in the right corner of my screen: \n        Dad: I miss you, kid! Can we talk today?\n        Penelope: Wanna talk tonight? Wish you were here, my love.\n        \u201cHello?\u201d My mother asked, and I watched her blink rapidly and look into the screen. I glanced at my own video feed. I looked terrified.\n        \u201cI gotta go, mom.\u201d I hoarsely answered, and as she began to inquire, I unplugged the monitor. As if suddenly freed from a trance, I unplugged every wire in a sudden frenzy, even unplugging the lamp beside my couch. I could barely steady my breath while standing alone in the dark of my apartment. \n        I listened, unsure of what to do. I\u2019d have to abandon everything. Where would I get my income from? I\u2019d been retired for a few years, living off of social security. How would I escape, and where would I go? My body was too frail and weak to support me in a pinch. I hadn\u2019t given death enough thought, and facing it now, I didn\u2019t know if I could handle it. \n        It was happening again. I felt like I was falling helplessly into the depths of nowhere.\n        My phone lit up beside me, and I grabbed at it, frantically reading a new text from Damien.\n        Damien: You really had me going Armie, your profile\u2019s just as filled out as mine! \n        Damien: Why\u2019re you leaving in such a rush? You better upload that speech for me!\n        Breathless, I stared at the screen, my heart in my stomach. Looking up, I heard a sharp knock at the door.\n        \u201cAre you ready to leave, Mr. Armand?\u201d An unknown voice asked me from beyond.\n"}

The story should be between 2200 and 2300 words long.","targets":"\tThe last battle of the last war fought between the kingdoms of Galata and Mosfeld took place outside my town of Stevinsal. Their armies, worn to the bone, gathered on the plains where we used to tend our crops and our animals. Our three seers warned us well ahead of time where these two forces would meet, so we abandoned our town and took only what we could carry from there. But I still felt a deep-seated anger for these kingdoms, these warriors, and their sovereigns. Our town had suffered during the war as each side fought the other for territory.\n\tI watched from the woods, though I was probably closer than my elders would have liked. The generals directed their troops into battle from anti-grav sleds that hadn\u2019t been recharged in weeks, while soldiers used their energy pistols as clubs and resorted to more \u201cprimitive\u201d weapons like swords. \n\tBoth nations fought for revenge. At least a hundred years worth of slights, territory grabs, resource hoarding, and generally poor leadership led each kingdom again to the plains of Aliva, outside our town.\n\tThe battle lasted two days before the generals realized that there would be no winner aside from the god of the dead and his carrion creatures. At least those creatures fed well. On the third day, messengers rode out from both sides, and we watched as people met carefully now, weapons discarded in favor of carts bearing what little food each side had left.\n\tMy parent was one of our three seers, and all three told our people that we should continue to wait. The armies could still turn on us if they saw us; shapechangers were rarely accepted in those kingdoms, accused of acting as spies or worse when they were discovered. None of us were terribly interested in dealing with the soldiers in any case; they\u2019d raided our storehouses to feed themselves, an understandable response, but with winter coming soon, it would force us to rely on hunting and gathering to sustain ourselves.\n\tSeven days after the messengers rode out, the sovereigns of both kingdoms came to my town with very little ceremony and small retinues. Queen Alis of Mosfeld looked as though she hadn\u2019t slept well in weeks, while King Varkan of Galata appeared nearly as emaciated as his troops. They spent several days in negotiations, but we had no idea what they were discussing. Several of my people tried to sneak into the camp they\u2019d set up in our town, but the soldiers were still alert for unfamiliar faces. \n\tAs curious as I was, instead of legs and arms, I chose a shape with paws. It is an old, old saying that a cat may look at a king, and so I did. I wanted to see the king and the queen who\u2019d destroyed their lands and made my people flee their homes.\n\tWhat I saw instead were two sovereigns, desperately tired, who assured each other that their advisors, who were responsible for the ongoing tensions between the kingdoms, had been executed. Both of them were apparently new to their rule, and had relied on their advisors more than they should have. \n\tThey also provided evidence that the merchants who\u2019d profited from the constant aggression had had their warehouses emptied, their accounts drained, and that money given to the people. And finally, that the agitators among the populace who\u2019d encouraged war were all imprisoned and would be tried as war criminals.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m still not sure whether our kingdom will survive this,\u201d Queen Alis admitted on the third day during a pause in their negotiations while their exhausted guards stood outside the room. \u201cThe warmongers on my side drove this conflict for so long that our fields may not produce enough food.\u201d\n\tKing Varkan stared down at his hands. \u201cWe could share our harvest and seedstock. It would mean a lean winter for Galata, but I think my people could live with that. I know my father couldn\u2019t, but he\u2019d been raised with stories of the glory of war, and wouldn\u2019t listen to me when I told him the cost.\u201d\n\t\u201cMy mother and father fought in the battle of Alstand, died there, and left me with a kingdom full of regrets. I still have subjects who think the war is justified over a slight from a hundred years ago, but they\u2019ve never seen a battle or counted the cost in lives.\u201d She paused, glancing around the room in fatigued curiosity. \u201cI wonder where the people are. Presumably they saw the armies coming and fled. It seems\u2026 unkind to use this hall without acknowledging the cost to others.\u201d\n\tVarkan nodded. \u201cThe cost to the people who lived here and the people of our countries as a start, as well as the cost to those who\u2019ve been wronged by our prejudices, whether human, shapechanger, elf, or the other peoples who\u2019ve likely avoided our kingdoms altogether.\u201d\n\tI blinked in shock. Was this king truly discussing apologizing to my people?\n\t\u201cFar too many to apologize to, and without anything but words, I do not know if they would take us seriously.\u201d She paused again. \u201cSpeaking of words, you have my condolences on the passing of your father, if that\u2019s at all appropriate.\u201d\n\tVarkan spat, an action that almost startled me into falling off the ledge I\u2019d chosen to lay on so that I might watch the two sovereigns. \u201cThe man was a delusional child, playing with toy soldiers on maps even into his sixth decade, encouraged by advisors and merchants who lost loved ones to the conflict or never felt the touch of famine.\u201d Trembling, the man pushed himself out of his chair. \u201cI accept your condolences in the spirit of good faith on your part, but we are better off with him dead. Had I any choice in the matter before his death last month, I would have sent negotiators to you to end this miserable conflict.\u201d\n\tAlis nodded, on the verge of tears. \u201cI wanted to reach out to you, but my chief advisor continually undermined me to the court. He told them a woman was unsuited to lead a war, on account of my gentle nature, and spread other, more harmful ideas. I do not like murder, but executing him in front of my court was a painful necessity. He always declared that steel was stronger than flesh, so I proved him right with my sword. I hope that the god of death punishes him and all the other warmongers we\u2019ve had to deal with.\u201d\n\tI crossed my paws as I considered the situation below me. These two were nothing like the people I had imagined leading a fruitless war. It sounded like Varkan\u2019s father and Alis\u2019 advisor were among the worst offenders, but they were dead and beyond vengeance.\n\tVarkan sat back in his chair, the brief moment of strength now exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m sure the patriots of my kingdom would rise up if they could, but even they have begun to see the cost of a war that has lasted almost a hundred years.\u201d\n\tAlis laughed bitterly, and said, \u201cPerhaps we should take all of our patriots, arm them, and make them fight each other. Allow them their bloodlust and mindless anger, while the rest of us try peace for a change.\u201d\n\t\u201cIf there were a feasible way to make that happen, I would,\u201d Varkan sighed. Tears started running down his face. \u201cI am so very tired, Queen Alis. Tired of the hate, tired of the idea that somehow war is good for a kingdom, tired of how little we\u2019ve actually accomplished in the past hundred years that would have made our kingdoms better and not worse.\u201d\n\t\u201cI regret that I was not strong enough to stop this war last year after my parents\u2019 deaths,\u201d Alis admitted, the tears finally running down her face.\n\tI watched as they wept unashamedly. Late last night, my parent begged me to wait and listen today, having had a vision of the future, and now I began to understand why. Two people, their sovereignty put aside for the moment, being truly vulnerable in this meeting. I was no seer to perceive the pathways of the future, but this seemed a pivotal moment. But whether to intervene or continue to watch?\n\tVarkan stared at the table between them for a long moment, then looked up at his counterpart. \u201cIt seems a foolish notion, but.\u201d He stopped, and shook his head. \u201cNo. Perhaps too foolish by far, especially with the decades of fighting.\u201d\n\t\u201cWe sit here across from each other, both of us vulnerable,\u201d Alis said slowly. \u201cPerhaps if you said what this notion is, together we could determine if it truly is foolish.\u201d\n\tThis felt like the moment my parent had wanted me to wait for. If Varkan revealed his notion, then perhaps these kingdoms could put war aside for good. Depending on his idea and her reaction, of course. But if he did not speak, or she refused, well, war might reignite here in this room.\n\tAfter a span of time that felt too long, Varkan whispered, \u201cA marriage of alliance. Necessity. Put an end to war between our kingdoms forever.\u201d\n\tI watched as Alis blushed to the roots of her golden hair. \u201cThere are\u2026 practicalities to consider.\u201d\n\t\u201cAn heir, when you prefer the company of women, and I have no interest in intimate relations with anyone? The aftermath of surviving the winter and next few years, when people begin to see past survival and return to loyalties now put aside? A name for a united kingdom?\u201d Varkan exhaled, defeat already written on his face as he raked thin fingers through his reddish-brown hair. \u201cSee? As I said, a foolish notion.\u201d\n\tAlis frowned, not in anger, but in thought. \u201cNot foolish, for I had a similar idea and similar concerns.\u201d Silence fell in the room as the two sovereigns struggled with this new wrinkle.\n\tI realized that how I thought of these two had changed; I thought they were the bitterest of enemies before they ever came to negotiate peace, but now I saw they were people on the verge of honest friendship. I suspected that this was the moment my parent had hoped for, and where I could finally intervene. So as a cat, I leapt down onto the table between them, purring. I suspected that Varkan would be more open to petting me, but I headbutted both their hands for attention.\n\tAlis chuckled weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a cat quite this golden. But, as with all cats, demanding and attention-seeking.\u201d She carefully scratched my head between my ears, and I closed my eyes in delight.\n\tVarkan moved to pet me as well, showing a familiarity with cats that I appreciated, as he slowly and softly ran his hand along my back. \u201cMy father preferred dogs, and while I do like them, I far prefer cats.\u201d\n\tAlis murmured agreement, and for a time, I let them pet me, bonding over something as simple as paying attention to what they saw as an animal. But then I saw my chance and shifted position such that their hands touched. Seemingly an accident, of course, but if there was no need for my vengeance, then there was a need for me to promote peace.\n\tFor a moment, the two looked at their hands touching, then Alis tentatively grasped Varkan\u2019s hand gently. I moved to the end of the table and perched there, waiting for what came next for these two.\n\tVarkan managed a smile. \u201cThis\u2026 feels like a start, at least.\u201d He carefully strengthened his grasp on her hand while still being gentle. \u201cAnd we have this cat to thank for bridging the gap.\u201d\n\tI couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\tThe shock on their faces was perhaps more of a delight than it should have been as I slowly shifted back into a human form. Well, human enough aside from my ears and tail. But as I watched them carefully, both watched me cautiously but with more curiosity than fear.\n\tAlis recovered first. \u201cHow may we address you?\u201d\n\tI smiled at them. \u201cI\u2019m no monarch, though one of my parents is enough of a leader to where you could maybe call me an heir? But Isha is fine. Welcome to our town of Stevinsal and to our Hall of Governance.\u201d\n\tVarkan carefully extended his other hand in an offer of greeting. \u201cWhatever your provenance, Isha, I am grateful you were here to help us.\u201d\n\t\u201cAs am I,\u201d Alis agreed as she also extended her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard everything we said, but I would still apologize to you and your people. I\u2019m sure the words themselves are cold comfort without action, though.\u201d Varkan nodded firmly in agreement.\n\tI took both of their hands. \u201cWarmer comfort than you might think. My people will be pleased to know you are both sincere in your desire for peace, and we\u2019re not unaware of the toll of the war on your kingdoms.\u201d I smiled lopsidedly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say this for myself. I\u2019m very glad to meet two people who are happier to make peace than war.\u201d\n\tI watched as both sovereigns looked at me with appraisal, perhaps more.\n\t\u201cThere is much work to be done,\u201d Varkan noted.\n\t\u201cBut it\u2019s work worth doing,\u201d Alis answered."}

As always, it is a comforting sound. It reminds me that somewhere in this world there is a place of peace for me. Peace that ends the moment I walk out of my assigned bedroom and into the cold, stark over illuminated halls of the Institution for Interstellar Exploration (IIE). The IIE is a massive military research compound where countless people live and work on top secret projects. \n        Given that I taught the Ethics of Exploration, it might seem curious to you that I am living in a top secret science institution that is run by the government. Believe me, this position took me by surprise too. A professor usually works at a university, not a government agency. However, one day Admiral Edwario Pinegrove recruited me. The process was quick and informal, to say the least.\n        I am just teaching my class as usual, I conclude my lecture and ask if there are any questions, and then dismiss the class. As they begin to walk out of the room, I put on my jacket and pick up my things. I look toward the door because I hear a noise and I see a man in uniform approaching me. His shoes make a distinctive click on the tile floor with each measured step that he takes. \n        He walks up to me, introduces himself as Admiral Edwario Pinegrove, and informs me that we need to talk immediately. The professor and students for the next class begin to enter the classroom, and with just a nod of his head, he indicates I should follow him. I walk closely behind him as we make our way past the incoming students into the hallway. \n        Given the current political situation, it is unwise to refuse a request from someone in military uniform. Ever since the asteroid hit our planet, the government has tightened up and military presence is now an everyday experience. Ivyana is not the same planet it was before the catastrophic event. Before the asteroid hit we were a democracy, now the military runs our lives. In theory we still have our elected Premier, Evape Norfolk, but they lead in name only. Their primary function is to deliver the edicts from the military in a more friendly manner. \n         Don\u2019t get me wrong. Life is not terrible considering we lost an entire continent of people from the impact. It\u2019s a year later and the sun is still partially obstructed by debris that our scientists have not figured out how to clear. We have space stations that orbit the planet which were already there before the asteroid impact, growing extra food for our ever increasing population.         We are not starving, but we do have to ration our supplies. The curfew we have is to supposedly cut down on potential blackmarket activities. Of course there is also a draft. Luckily, I\u2019m old enough not to worry about that. \n        I run into the admiral's back as he stops to open a door. He gives me a scornful look of disbelief. I guess his soldiers never run into him when he stops walking. We get into the back of a black car. To say that I am nervous is an understatement. \n        Admiral Pinegrove begins speaking in a deep measured voice, \u201cProfessor Silverlie, you have been drafted to work at the IIE. We are undertaking a top secret project and require someone who can weigh in on ethical issues. You will report to me directly. We are headed to your apartment, you have one hour to pack. You may bring one suitcase full of clothes, a briefcase of books, and your dog. No electronic devices are allowed. You will be given what you need when we get to the IIE. I\u2019ll wait here, and my attach\u00e9 will accompany you inside the house. You are to make no calls. We will notify your contacts.\u201d\n        Suddenly, the black car stops and the door is opened. I\u2019m at my apartment building. It\u2019s hard to think with everything going on. My dog is running around all excited until she sees my suitcase. Rose hates when I leave her, and now she is sad. I assure her that she is coming with me.\n        The rest of the day is a blur for me. The attach\u00e9 takes Rose and my bags, then we find ourselves with the admiral in the back of the black car. When we arrive at the IIE the attach\u00e9 takes us to have our pictures taken, even Rose. My fingerprints are taken on an electric device that also tracks biometrics in a way that I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m told which door colors I\u2019m never to approach (thankfully the doors are color coded) and given a quick tour of the general area I\u2019ll be in. My world now includes a mess hall, a small office for me, and my room. My room has a bed, dresser, and desk for furniture. Luckily, I have my own bathroom. I notice that my bags are on my bed. I unpack. The attach\u00e9 said they would be back to take me to dinner. \n        And so begins my life at the IIE. Considering I have absolutely no choice about being here, life is not too awful. My days are filled with research in my office with Rose. The precise topic depends on the needs of the leadership, and sometimes changes throughout the day. I\u2019m called to meet with them randomly depending on their other obligations. Mostly, my day consists of research, and orders sent by the attach\u00e9. The attach\u00e9 is not very friendly, they only say what they must and lead me where I need to go. I can move freely between my room, the office, and the mess hall. The food here is bland. For breakfast I have barely warm coffee and a stale pastry of some sort. Rose gets a bowl of dog food. There are military dogs here, and so they have supplies. She eats when I eat. \n        I realize as I walk down the over illuminated stark hall with Rose that I have lost track of time. I can\u2019t remember how long I have been here. The routine of it all is somewhat numbing. I think it has been a few months. Rose and I continue the walk to the mess hall. I get our food and sit down. I put Rose\u2019s food and water beside me. The attach\u00e9 approaches us with two other soldiers. Without a word one of them grabs Rose and gives her an injection. \n        I scream \u201cNo!\u201d as I try to stop them, but the other soldier grabs me. I feel a jab in my own arm and the last thing I hear is, \u201cadmiral\u2019s orders.\u201d \n        I wake up in a small room. My head is killing me, and I feel nauseous. I try to sit up, but it takes so much effort. I start to panic. Where is Rose? Where am I? I swing my legs over the edge of the bed and my feet brush something warm and furry. Rose. I\u2019m so relieved, at least I\u2019m not in this alone, whatever this is. \n        The sound in the room is different from what I\u2019m used to, it is a hum that is not from the lights. There is a tiny small window in front of the desk on the other side of the room. I can only see blackness from here. It must be night. I make my way to the window. I look out and grab the desk for support. I\u2019m not on my planet. My planet is in the near distance growing smaller. I\u2019m in space. \n        Nothing can justify being taken off of one\u2019s home planet against one\u2019s will, nothing! This is the admiral\u2019s doing, I know it. Afterall, the last words I heard before passing out from the injection were \u201cadmiral's orders.\u201d \n        Indeed. He will pay for this. Someway, I\u2019ll figure out a way to make him pay. I thought our working relationship was solid. I mean, he was respectful when I presented my research in the meetings. Why would he force me on a spaceship? Of course it was his minion the attach\u00e9 who actually drugged me, but on his orders. Nevertheless, the minion is on my revenge list as well. \n        Before I give my thoughts of revenge anymore time, I walk over to Rose and stroke her. She moves her head and gives me a little lick. She is probably feeling as bad as I am from the injection. I\u2019m not really sure how long I\u2019ve been sitting on the floor with Rose, but I think it\u2019s been a couple of hours. It feels much longer. The only light on in the room is the one on the desk. There is also a light by the bed, and one on the ceiling.                         I haven\u2019t tried to turn either of them on.\n        Suddenly, there is a brisk knock on the door. A person with a tray comes in and they set it on the desk. The only thing they say to me is that this is dinner. I make sure to tell them that my dog\u2019s name is Rose. I ask them what time it is. They do not answer, they just leave. The door shuts with an ominous click. I walk over to the door, but as I anticipate, it\u2019s locked. They will pay for this, the admiral and attach\u00e9. It may take time, but I will think of a suitable revenge for being removed from my homeworld and locked in this room on a spaceship against my will. \n        The medication must have addled my brain a bit because I hear myself start to laugh. The thoughts of revenge remind me of an old Earth movie that some of our explorers brought back from a mission years ago. It has this song Just You Wait, and the last verse fits my mood toward the admiral and his attach\u00e9 presently, \u201cThen they'll march you, Henry Higgins, to the wall. And the king will tell Eliza, sound the call. As they lift their rifles higher. I'll shout ready, aim, fire. Oh oh oh, Henry Higgins. Down you'll go, Henry Higgins. Just you wait.\u201d \n        I replace Henry Higgins with Admiral Pinegrove in my mind and sing the song again to myself. It doesn\u2019t make me happy per se, but a bit more able to breathe given the circumstance in which I currently find myself. I think I can also replace Henry Higgins with the attach\u00e9. Yes, I think it works too. I hear myself singing the verse out loud. Apparently, space does not help one\u2019s pitch. Poor Rose, as always she has to hear me sing. \n        This is no time for flights of fancy, I sternly tell myself. Rose needs her dinner and I should eat something as well. I take the food and water over to Rose. At first she is not interested, but I coax her into eating. Then I go to the desk and sit down in the chair. I stare at the silver food tray before me. There is a bottle of water, a sandwich of some sort, and a little pile of wilted green vegetables. Not appetizing, to say the least, but at least Rose and I are still together. I force myself to eat.\n        I have no idea what to do next. I finally notice my bag and briefcase are on the floor next to the desk. Normally, it would bother me that other people had been in my room and packed my things, but really, that is the least troubling thing for me at the moment. I look at my planet slowly getting smaller in the distance through the tiny window. I start to cry and can\u2019t stop. I sink to the floor and feel Rose lean against me, trying the best she can to comfort me. She doesn\u2019t know what to do either, so she licks my face and paws me for a pet. How long we sit like this, I can\u2019t say.\n        The door opens again, and this time the attach\u00e9 is standing there. They only say, follow me. Rose's leash is hanging on the chair, so I take it and hook it to her collar. There is no way I\u2019m going anywhere without her. I\u2019m ready to fight the attach\u00e9 on this matter, but they say nothing and just begin to walk down the hall. \n        The attach\u00e9 stops in front of a large metal door. Just a gray door. In the IIE, gray is a color door that I\u2019m allowed to open. As the attach\u00e9 opens the door, I see Admiral Pinegrove, and the other leaders to whom I usually present my research, sitting around a large table. The admiral indicates that I should sit next to him. I take my seat, and Rose sits on the floor beside me. No one is even giving her a glance. Their lack of concern about a dog in the room makes me nervous. What is going on here?\n        The admiral begins to speak in his measured deep voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were brought here as you were. There was no other choice. The asteroid that hit our planet caused internal structural damage. The damage continues to worsen. We don't know exactly how long, but within months we think the planet will implode. It\u2019s not a question of if, just when. \n        \u201cThe mission of the IIE for this last year has been tracking the condition of the planet and making relocation plans. This past year we have been sending military personnel, high ranking government officials, military medical personnel, scientists, engineers, farmers, and military educators to a planet we found some years back that is at least habitable for us. \n        \u201cAll the people sent to the new planet so far work with the IIE, military, or are in the government, and most were told before boarding the ship that they were going on a routine mission. The type of mission they signed up for when joining the IIE.  Very few people actually knew what was going on until they attended a meeting on the ship well after take off. It has to be done this way to avoid panic.\n         \u201cMost people at the IIE don\u2019t know that this is the end mission, only a few people in the government have this knowledge. What we do tell them is that the ships leaving are for usual exploration missions. Given how mundane these missions have become over the years, they have not garnered any interest. Since you don\u2019t have high security clearance, we couldn't tell you this information back home. We also couldn\u2019t risk that you might say something to another person while in shock. Panic must be avoided at all costs if we are to save the maximum number of people in the brief time we have left.\n        \u201cI decided it would be easiest just to sedate you and put you on the ship. Since you are a contractor with the IIE, putting you visibly on the ship might have raised questions, so we snuck you in more or less before the normal boarding. Lucky for us you are a person of routine and like to eat when there are few people in the mess hall. We can tell you this now because everyone on the ship has been informed. Moreover, as an added precaution only people with security codes can send messages back home. \n        \u201cThe research you have done, and will continue to do will help us set up an equitable society under harsher conditions than we are used to. It\u2019s also being used to make plans to evacuate as many people from the planet as fairly as possible before the implosion. \n        \u201cThe infrastructure on the new planet is almost functional, and once it\u2019s ready, there is a plan to evacuate civilians. We don\u2019t know how many we'll be able to save. We have a fleet of ships, but we are not sure how much time we actually have. Our Premier, Evape Norfolk is on this vessel to help set up the new government. Their second in command is on Earth keeping the government running for now. I know this is a lot to take in, but do you have any questions?\u201d\n        Thoughts of revenge leave my mind. I\u2019m trying to take in the enormity of what I\u2019m hearing. My heart is breaking, my home planet is going to die, along with countless people. If I can help them work out a plan to save as many people as possible whilst there is time, that must be my focus. There will be time to grieve later, for now focus on what can be done and who can be saved. I hear myself respond, \u201cTell me what I need to do next, Admiral.\u201d\n"}

She was hemming and hawing over whether she would sneak out to the back pasture to attend the fight of the century. If she did, she knew she would take a switch to the backside. But considering the epic nature of the brawl, she figured it just might be worth the whooping.\n        Clara\u2019s great-grandfather, Josephus Henry Hasselback, had built this home with his own hands nearly seventy years ago, after the Civil War. When he returned home, he married a local girl and started a family right here in this house on the hill. Now, in the year 1936, his descendants considered this home the center of the family. Josephus\u2019 son Levi, the current family patriarch, owned the house with his wife, Betty Sue, but Clara just knew them as Pappy and Memaw. \n        It was late June, and Clara was eating fistfuls of wild blackberries freshly picked from the roadside brambles. Her mouth and hands were stained the color of bruises, contrasting sharply with her pale, freckled skin and curly brown hair. The Great Depression had hit the family hard, and she, along with her mother and father, had to move back here when her father lost his job working for the railroad in Chattanooga. \n        Clara was ten years old. She did not know her extended family well, but within a few weeks of living with her grandparents, she came to know the arch villain in her family\u2019s grand narrative: the McCallisters. This information flowed freely and easily from the mouths of every Hasselback who came to visit.\n        \u201cDid you hear that old Jenny McCallister stole a full jug of shine from Johnny\u2019s still last weekend? And then she had the nerve to tell everyone in Maryvale that she fed it to her dog, and the dog went blind!\u201d Aunt Janie Kate said to Clara one day from the porch swing. \n        During Sunday supper another week, Cousin Tommy told Clara that James McCallister had once tried to sail to New York City in a row boat on the creek. Daddy then added to the tale, blaming James\u2019 Mama, Mrs. Amy McCallister, for her son\u2019s lack of sound judgment, saying that she \u201chad snakes in her head.\u201d \n        Two weeks ago, Uncle Hezekiah came over to help Memaw put pickled peaches into cold storage. As he unloaded mason jars from the cellar, he told Clara how Zelda McCallister had been seen more than once gallivanting in men\u2019s pants down in Printer\u2019s Alley in Nashville. Memaw gasped.\n        Every decade or so, the gossip would build up into a major throw down. Back in 1882, the first fracas pitted my Pappy, Levi, against Earl McCallister\u2019s boy, John, in a fist fight in the creek. The feud was in its earliest days then, and that brawl could have been considered more of a teenager's scuffle. But things only escalated after that.\n        In 1899, John\u2019s son Andrew came home from the Spanish-American War too big for his britches after receiving several medals for bravery while fighting in the Philippine Islands. So when he overheard Sinclair Hasselback at the local juke joint say that Teddy Roosevelt wore a false mustache, they went to fisticuffs right then and there.\n        One of the worst skirmishes happened back in 1924. Sunday services were almost at an end at the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Maryvale when Aunt Janie Kate Hasselback got overwhelmed with the spirit. Just as the organ played out the congregation into the churchyard, Janie Kate shouted out that the McCallister women were nothing but Jezebels. Before the pastor could pray for help, Bessie McCallister had Janie Kate by the hair, and Zelda McCallister had punched Aunt Caroline square in the nose.\n        But this entire intergenerational feud came to a head yesterday morning when Pappy took a spill off of his mule, fracturing his hip along with two ribs. Mama and Aunt Janie Kate were able to get Pappy into his bed, while Uncle Hezekiah rode to town and brought back the local doctor. The doctor said that things did not look good for Pappy due to his age, and we should all prepare ourselves for the worst.\n        Daddy and his brothers were enraged about the accident. The mule had tripped on a hard stone. It seemed unlikely that the mule and the plow would have missed such a large rock in the field for all these years. Within hours, the brothers were yelling about the McCallisters putting the rock there to take down Pappy once and for all. By sunset, the brothers had sent Uncle Hezekiah on horseback to deliver a message to Colin McCallister, the elderly patriarch of the McCallister clan and the last living son of Earl McCallister. They should select a fighter from their brood to face off against a fighter from ours the following day at noon.\n        Clara sat on the porch the next day, thinking about feuds\u2014how they began and how they came to an end. She recalled the murky beginnings of her family\u2019s feud with the McCallisters as told to her by Memaw the night before. She sat in her rocker next to Pappy\u2019s bed and spoke softly to Clara about how hate can spread like the invasive kudzu that was slowly spreading across the South.\n        The conflicting origins of the feud had trickled down through both families over the years, but Memaw shared with me what she knew of each version. Josephus Hasselback and Earl McCallister had left for war at the age of eighteen, and Earl\u2019s baby brother, Liam, who was only sixteen had tagged along with them. The three marched off to battle in 1862 with a local unit of the Tennessee Volunteers as part of the Confederate Army under Stonewall Jackson.\n        The three boys grew into men as they fought in many brutal battles across Pennsylvania and Virginia. Then, in one fateful skirmish in the Shenandoah Valley, Liam McCallister was hit by shrapnel from an exploding shell and Earl McCallister was knocked unconscious. The last thing Earl remembered was seeing Josephus run towards his wounded brother. When he awoke, he was sitting in the back of a wagon with Josephus and several other Confederate soldiers. They were prisoners of war.\n        Earl asked Josephus what had happened to Liam. Josephus got quiet for a minute and then said that after Earl was knocked out, he realized that he couldn\u2019t drag both Liam and Earl off the field. Liam was more seriously injured than his brother, and he told Josephus to take Earl and run. Josephus broke down then, saying he prayed over Liam, said his goodbyes, and then dragged Earl into the woods before both of them were captured. \n        Earl was devastated. His baby brother was gone. Later, the two men were able to escape their captivity together as they were being transported to a POW camp. When Earl asked how in the world they could walk back home five hundred miles with only the clothes on their backs and hardly any money, Josephus pulled out a wallet from his back pocket, revealing a handful of Confederate gold coins. This was also the exact moment when the McCallister-Hasselback feud was born.\n        The men began their long journey in silence. Earl McCallister knew the wallet and the coins all too well. He had given it to his baby brother Liam for Christmas the year before they left for the war. Likewise, Josephus knew what Earl thought he had done. Several times on their two-week trek back to Maryvale, he tried to tell his side of the story: that Liam gave him the wallet in his dying moments to help them get home. But Earl would not listen, and Josephus grew bitter at the idea that his dearest friend stole from his dying brother.\n        \u201cThe rest,\u201d Memaw said, \u201cis history.\u201d\n        Clara sat in deep thought on the front porch. She sighed, tossing the remaining blackberries into the weeds, and stomped up the steps. The house was eerily quiet, as the rest of the family had already made their way over to the field for the big event.\n        Pappy was laid up in the brass bed but awake. He was whispering something to himself as Clara entered the room.\n        \u201cAre you saying something, Pappy?\u201d Clara said.\n        \u201cFoolishness. It\u2019s all just foolishness. I should have stopped it long ago.\u201d Pappy in his rough and raspy voice.\n        \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Clara replied.\n        \u201cReach up under the bed on Memaw\u2019s side. There should be an old cigar box there. Do you see it?\" Pappy said. \n        Clara got down on her knees and pulled out the old box. The fragrance of tobacco wafted into the air. Clara looked inside and saw a small, black, leather-bound book. She opened it up and read the names on the inside cover. An envelope fell out, which she also opened. It contained a small gold cross necklace and a letter.\n        \u201cPappy, what is all this, and why didn\u2019t you say anything about it?\u201d she said.\n        \u201cIt is Liam McCallister\u2019s bible and Josephus\u2019 Hasselback\u2019s gold necklace. The letter is from a woman up in Virginia. She said that her mother found my Uncle Liam in the woods back in 1862. He was badly wounded. She nursed him in her home for a week before he passed. He had nothing on him but this Bible and this necklace. Her daughter found these in her mother\u2019s things years later, when she died. She saw the names in the book and tracked down our address. We got it in the mail back in 1906.\u201d Pappy said. \u201cI guess I figured that after so many years of fighting, it was too late to make amends. But thinking about seeing you and your Memaw for the last time made me realize what a waste this hate has been. Take this to them and end it once and for all, sweet girl.\u201d\n        Clara grabbed the little book and the letter and bolted out the bedroom door. She bound down the splintery front porch steps in bare feet, plodding her way through the summer flowers of black-eyed susans and touch-me-nots. She reached the field in a flash. It seemed like every Hasselback and McCallister for miles had gathered on either side of their champion. \n        In the center stood the two fighters. Hezekiah Hasselback stood on the left, a short but sturdy man. He was nearly forty but had worked laying railroad ties for nearly twenty-five years. At this point, he was more muscle than man. His sleeves were rolled up to the elbow, revealing rippling muscle the color of tanned leather. \n        On the right stood Zelda McCallister. At six feet one and weighing at least two hundred pounds, Zelda had not worn a dress since her baptism in 1917. She had taken down many men in Nashville bar fights and was rumored to have killed a guy who attacked her while walking home late one night from a party in Chattanooga. With her auburn hair tied tightly into a bun, she stood at the ready.\n        Clara did not skip a beat as she ran past Uncle Hezekiah and straight to Zelda. A gasp rose up from the Hasselback crowd, and Zelda looked down at Clara incredulously. Clara placed the little book and letter in Zelda\u2019s large hands. Zelda leaned down as Clara whispered the secret to her. In shock, Zelda motioned to her grandfather, Colin McCallister, to come to the center of the field. As he did so, the crowd of Hasselbacks and McCallisters closed in.\n        Colin took the little book from Zelda first and opened its cover. \u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d He said. \u201cAfter all these years, It\u2019s Uncle Liam\u2019s bible. I never met him, but my father, Earl, said he carried it with him throughout the war. It was a gift to him from Mrs. Annie Hasselback, Josephus\u2019 Mama. She worried about him going off to war with my Daddy so young. So she sent it with him. It has both her name and his right here inside the cover.\u201d\n        Colin McCallister then pulled out a gold cross necklace from the envelope. It had belonged to Josephus Hasselback, but not originally. It was once a valuable family heirloom for the MCallisters. Mrs. Alice McCallister had given it to Josephus in thanks for looking after Earl and Liam as they set off for war in 1862. Both families then knew that Josephus hadn\u2019t lied about the wallet. After all, he would never have given Liam such a valuable treasure if he were only concerned about money.\n        The feud did end that day, but not in the way we thought it would. Pappy defied the doctor and lived another ten years after that. Colin McCallister visited him every Sunday after church. After all, just as hate takes time to grow, so too do forgiveness and healing."}

His \u201cfriend\u201d was there. In the retirement home. He had spotted the foe from across the dining room. He could never forget that face. Such sweet irony that they would find each other again in a place so similar to where the madness had begun.\n        The meal had been meat and potatoes. No one knew what the meat was, but the potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Easily the best thing the kitchen produced. People that asked what the meat was would often have their meals cut. Just another fun experience in the life of the retirement home. \n        Servers swarmed around the tables, depositing food in front of the huddled husks of geriatric eaters. As the food servers delivered their goods like drones to the waiting mouths, Torrenz kept his unerring gaze on the target of his animosity. At least, until one of the waiters walked past, and he lost sight of his foe. \n        Swiveling his head around the room, Torrenz searched and searched for the vanishing enemy. He blinked, then stood up. A food server walked over and put a hand on his shoulder.\n        \u201cPlease, Mr. Torrenz, try not to make a scene today. Your food is right here in front of you, and it\u2019s your favorite,\u201d the server said.\n        Torrenz looked down at the plate on the table, then back up at the server. \n        \u201cOf course! I\u2019m so very sorry about that. I\u2019ll be certain to clean my plate with this delicious meal. Thank you very much for the cooking!\u201d Torrenz said, putting on his most winning smile. \n        The server frowned, having seen Torrenz\u2019s acting in the past, but not wanting to press the issue. He drifted off to handle other issues, and Torrenz was left to stew over his lost target.\n        It had taken him months to work out his plan. During lunch, he would stealthily make his way over to his great enemy and sneakily put laxatives in their meal. The sheer embarrassment of having to acknowledge his own biological imperative would ruin what little remained of his life! Thus, securing Torrenz\u2019s inevitable revenge. \n        But with the target gone\u2026 Torrenz needed to find an alternative, starting with where the target went. \n        Utilizing all of his skill trained to a honed edge through a lifetime of clandestine work, Torrenz shoveled all the food into his mouth, stood up, and \u201cretired to his room\u201d. Except, instead of going back to his room, he opted to snoop around the retirement home for his target. \n        Yet, despite his searching, he couldn\u2019t find him. The target was simply gone. \n        Despairing at the loss of his purpose, he took the radical option. He approached the nearest helper, who sat behind a receptionist\u2019s desk. The individual was a woman, short build, long blonde hair, nice face. Torrenz suavely slid into her peripheral vision. She looked up at him with a disgusted face for a moment, but she corrected it quickly. It was obvious to Torrenz that the expression hadn\u2019t been a reaction to seeing him. That was impossible. Instead, it was clearly an instinctive reaction to the realization that her life had been completely empty before she had seen the most interesting man alive.  \n        \u201cHello ma\u2019am. I\u2019d like to inquire as to the whereabouts of one Atticus Esquire. Do you happen to know where he is?\u201d Torrenz said.\n        The woman frowned. \n        \u201cMr. Torrenz, I\u2019ve told you a few times now. Your friend Mr. Atticus has been moved to hospice care,\u201d she said.\n        Torrenz\u2019s world rocked beneath him. The suave arm placement became a steadying anchor. \n        \u201cHow\u2026 how long ago did this happen?\u201d Torrenz asked.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s been a few weeks. We\u2019re all amazed he\u2019s been able to hang on this long,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cThis can\u2019t be. I just saw him in the cafeteria,\u201d Torrenz said.\n        The woman sighed. \n        \u201cYes, Mr. Torrenz. You\u2019ve been seeing him in the cafeteria every few days now. Like I\u2019ve told you.                         Several times now,\u201d she said. \n        \u201cNo! This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to go!\u201d Torrenz suddenly shouted. \n        The woman moved her chair back and glanced at one of the orderlies nearby, who stood from his chair and started moving over. \n        \u201cCan I see him?\u201d Torrenz asked.\n        The woman shook her head. \n        \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Torrenz, you aren\u2019t cleared for visiting. Maybe I could send a message?\u201d \n        Torrenz slouched. \n        \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. I see now that this is my fault. I waited too long. In an effort to lull Atticus into a false sense of security, I made the mistake of stewing in my own imagined victory rather than claiming it for myself,\u201d Torrenz said.\n        \u201cMr. Torrenz, I have no idea what you\u2019re on about. If I remember correctly, Atticus said you two were childhood friends.\u201d the woman said. \n        \u201cAlas, that same childhood was what started this entire debacle. I\u2019ve spent my entire life planning for this sweet revenge, and now it has slipped through my fingers. My entire life was a waste, I tell you! A waste!\u201d Torrenz shouted. \n        The orderly came up behind Torrenz, grabbed him, and started pulling him away. Before he rounded the corner towards the rooms, the woman held up a hand. The orderly stopped and the woman walked up to Torrenz.\n        \u201cYou know, before they put you in your room, I\u2019ve always wondered. What\u2019s the story? Why do you hate Mr. Atticus so much?\u201d the woman asked as Torrenz feebly fought against the orderly\u2019s arms.\n        \u201cOnly the most heinous act one could commit! He stole my pizza from me during pizza day! The greatest day in every kindergartener\u2019s week! The man was born evil, his sins inscribed on his soul at birth! My revenge might be unnecessary now as the reaper takes his swing, but let it be known that had I the chance, I would make that demon face the darkest pits of Hell!\u201d"}
{"example_id":"example_056","inputs":"Write a story about someone who is out for revenge but then finds out there is no need to take revenge after all. It must be between 1400 and 1500 words. The story should begin with a wrestling match in an arena. One of the wrestlers should be too aggressive in the ,atch and seriously injure the other. He breaks his sternum and ribs. He should also have a collapsed lung. He takes several months to recover from the injuries and wonders if the injuries were intentional or not. He will have decided to get revenge on the other wrestler but then changes his mind after he meets a boy playing with toy cars. The boy is his fan and the child of the man who injured him. ","targets":"\tThe Iceberg, Ivan Berg, grabbed Enzo Valentine by the ankles and dragged him to the corner of the ring. Enzo\u2019s long, sweat-drenched hair streaked his blood across the mat. The Iceberg balanced on the top turnbuckle and berated the thunderous crowd. The spectators booed and jeered at the heel, who flexed and kissed his biceps. He turned around and looked down upon his opponent sprawled motionless below. He propelled himself off the turnbuckle. In a beautifully choreographed maneuver, Enzo rolled to his left and the Iceberg belly-flopped on the mat. \n\tCheers filled the arena as excited fans waved bright poster board signs lauding Enzo. Enzo used his arms to crawl to the edge of the ring. He reached for the bottom rope. With the most dramatic effort, he pulled himself up and rested against the top rope. \n\tBart Bogus, The Iceberg\u2019s manager, stood by the ring and pounded the mat as he screamed for his wrestler to get up. Enzo stumbled over to his opponent and dropped to his knees. He threw his body across the Iceberg to pin him without hooking his leg. The match was to continue, and he had to make sure Ivan could escape. \n\tThe Iceberg kicked out of the hold and onto his feet, throwing Enzo across the ring. Their animosity off camera carried over to the squared circle, and Enzo could feel every bit of the throw\u2019s extra force on his bruised and aching body.  As a seasoned wrestling veteran, he dreaded matches against opponents as green as Ivan. They were cocky and careless, making them more prone to make mistakes. He had seen many good friends\u2019 careers end because of a poorly executed piledriver or a miscalculated kick. Both men, on their feet again, squared up, clinched each other, and grappled. \n\tEnzo leaned in close to Ivan\u2019s ear. \u201cYou better not injure me,\u201d he said. \n\tThe Iceman narrowed his eyes and snarled. He overtook Enzo and, with full force, flung him over the top rope. Enzo crashed chest-first into a steel barrier. The impact bounced him to the concrete floor with a loud thud. The wind was knocked out of him. Enzo tried to take a breath, but he felt like he was suffocating. A sharp, intense pain stabbed his lungs. He instinctively grabbed his chest.\n\tThe crowd roared and people rose to their feet to get a better look at Enzo, who was writhing in agony. Fans on the front row swarmed the fence and shouted at the injured wrestler. \u201cGet up, you wimp!\u201d \n\tThe Iceberg climbed over the top rope and leapt off the apron. He stood over Enzo and raised his foot, preparing to stomp him. His black boot came down hard on Enzo\u2019s chest. The suffering wrestler opened his mouth to scream, but with no breath, nothing came out. Without restraint, the Iceberg lifted Enzo and tossed him back in the ring. \n\tIvan slid under the bottom rope, and prepared to pin Enzo. \u201cWow, man. You\u2019re really selling it,\u201c he said as he went to hook Enzo\u2019s leg. Enzo looked Ivan directly in the eyes. It was evident that the injury was real. \n\t\u201cHey, bud. Squeeze my hand if you\u2019re okay,\u201d Ivan said. Enzo struggled to shake his head from side to side. \n\tThe referee ran over, confused. This was not part of the script. Ivan shouted, \u201cGet him some help! Now!\u201d\n\tThe crowd fell silent when the ref raised his arms in the dreaded \u201cX\u201d above his head, signaling a legitimate injury. The paramedics on standby rushed to Enzo\u2019s aid. Ivan covered his face with his hand as his opponent was wheeled out of the arena on a gurney. \n\tEnzo\u2019s injuries were serious. With that ill-fated throw, he suffered a broken sternum, seven cracked ribs, and a collapsed lung. Because he couldn\u2019t take deep breaths, he developed a respiratory infection that soon turned to pneumonia. He was in the hospital for two weeks. Two weeks with nothing to do except replay that night over and over in his mind. \n\tWhen he tried to sleep, fuzzy memories of the evening came to him. They blended into his dreams, and he wasn\u2019t certain what was real and what was fake. Did the Iceberg intentionally lean into the shoulder bump when they collided in the hall before the match? Ivan definitely threatened him under his breath when they were grappling. Enzo could vividly hear his nemesis\u2019 maniacal laugh as he brutally stomped on his broken sternum. The more time he spent in that hospital bed, the more he was convinced his injury was not an accident. \n\tOnce he was released from the hospital, he had at least six more weeks of rest and recovery ahead of him. Within an hour of the doctor giving him the all clear to begin physical therapy, he was back at the gym. His wrath drove him to push himself at every session. Ivan the Iceberg would pay for every match canceled, every dollar lost, and every bit of respect Enzo\u2019s fans lost for him. After six months, driven by rage and revenge, he was ready to get back in the ring. \n\tThe CEO of the wrestling federation, Walt McLain, requested a meeting with Enzo his first day back to give him the rundown on the new storyline. Enzo looked at the photos of his wrestling heroes covering the walls of the office. He turned his attention to Walt, who leaned forward, resting his arms on his desk.\n\t\u201cSince your absence, Ivan has really gained popularity amongst the fans,\u201d said Walt.\n\tEnzo looked stoically at his boss.\n\tWalt continued, \u201cWith your return, this might be a good chance for him to turn babyface and you to turn heel. It has all the drama of a great rivalry.\u201d \n\tFans loved the good guy, and babyfaces easily made more money from merch and appearances. Walt didn\u2019t expect Enzo to take the news well. He searched his face for some hint of a reaction, but Enzo remained expressionless.\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re thinking you could make your big comeback next Monday\u2019s episode. Ivan can introduce you and apologize. He goes in for a hug, and you turn on him.\u201d\n\tThis was the perfect opportunity to avenge his near career-ending match. Though scripted, wrestling was much more real than people realized. He would return the beat down tenfold. If they wanted a heel, a heel they would get. \n\tAfter an uncomfortable silence, Enzo stood up and nodded. \u201cYeah. Sounds good, man. I\u2019ve gotta get to the gym. It\u2019s good seeing you.\u201d\n\tEnzo shook Walt\u2019s hand and strode out of the office. Walt had dealt with countless unhinged giants. He could handle a conniption. However, he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of Enzo\u2019s coolness. \n\tThe wrestling federation employees greeted Enzo warmly as he headed down the hall toward the gym. Some patted him on the back. Most gave him a wave or a handshake. \tHe passed the lobby and saw a boy, maybe six or seven, sitting on the floor and zooming his toy cars on the tile floor. \n\t\u201cHow ya doin\u2019, little guy?\u201d Enzo said as he passed the boy.\n\tThe boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he jumped to his feet. He ran up to Enzo with no fear and no hesitation. Enzo squatted down so he could be on his level. \u201cI\u2019m Enzo, and you are?\u201d\n\t\u201cCharlie! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay! I was so scared when you got hurt!\u201d The boy shifted excitedly from side to side. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite wrestler!\u201d\n\tEnzo smiled for what seemed like the first time in six months. \u201cWhat d\u2019ya have there?\u201d he asked.\n\tHe spent the next five minutes talking to Charlie about cars and video games and superheroes. The squeak of sneakers on the tile floor echoed down the hall, and Enzo heard a familiar voice.\n\t\u201cHey, Charlie. Are you ready to -\" Ivan froze.\n\tEnzo stood up, chest puffed out. A huge grin spread across Ivan\u2019s face, and he wrapped his arms around Enzo. He winced and Ivan let up on his hold a little. \u201cOh my God! I can\u2019t believe you're back. I wanted to call you, but I just didn\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m so sorry, brother! I can\u2019t believe I was so careless. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d \n\tIvan finally paused to take a breath and released Enzo from his grasp. \n\t\u201cThis your kid?\u201d Enzo asked.\n\t\u201cYeah, yes, this is Charlie. He\u2019s your biggest fan. He likes you better than he does me,\u201d Ivan replied. \n\t\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid.\u201d He patted Ivan on the back. \u201cCharlie, I\u2019ll see you around, little guy.\u201d \n\tAs Enzo walked down the hall, he thought about his heroes, whose pictures lined the walls. He pictured the gleam in Charlie\u2019s eye. Ivan was sincere in his apology, that he knew for sure. The clanking of weights grew louder as he approached the gym. This would not be the beginning of his heel era. \n"}

Listening to jazz on her wireless headphones, she smiled, breathed deeply, and looked at her watch. \n        It's almost time for my support group, she thought. \n        You stole my smart surface invention, you stole Brian, and my depression put me in a sanitarium for four years. Her breathing became ragged, and she took out a small notebook. Hands shaking, she wrote in it briefly. \n        I accept the validity of my emotions.\n        A large black SUV pulled into the drive next to the sports car, and the woman put her notebook away. Her friend, Julya, got out of the driver\u2019s side. The husband, Brian, also emerged, along with two teenage boys. \n        A bus stopped in front of the woman, and she boarded.\n        The woman appeared at the bus stop early the next morning. In less than an hour, Julya came out of the house, got into the black SUV, and drove off. \n        This is focusing on something other than myself.\n        Later, Brian came out, got into the red sports car, and left. He came back a few minutes later with another woman in the car. They laughed and went into the house, kissing as the door closed. After about an hour, Brian and the woman left again. \n        Sometime later, several teenage boys approached the bus stop. The woman noticed that two of them were Julya\u2019s sons. The woman went back to watching the house but occasionally glanced over to observe the boys. The group stopped next to a four-door coupe. One of the boys pulled a metal bar from his coat sleeve, inserted it into the driver's door, and popped it open. Laughing, the boys all climbed into the car and took off.\n        The next morning, the woman is at the bus stop listening to a piano concerto when Brian leaves with the boys.

The woman follows.\n        Julya opens her refrigerator, takes out a large container of orange juice, and pours herself a glass. The woman enters the kitchen.\n        \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d Julya asks.\n        \u201cYou stole my idea, you stole my man, and you stole years of my life.\u201d\n        Julya rolled her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal years of your life. You did that because you were too stupid to protect either and couldn\u2019t live with yourself afterward.\u201d She waves a hand, and the entire bare wall of the kitchen opposite the windows comes to life as four panels of smart television screens. \u201cOur smart surface technology went public last week. Brian and I are going to be rich. We are happy and beautiful.\u201d  \n        The woman nods. \u201cGood for you.\u201d\n        Julya sits at the kitchen table and looks her up and down. \u201cYou are miserable and depressing.\u201d When the woman says nothing, Julya shakes her head. \u201cLook, if I said I felt bad for you because you were my friend, does that help?

There is no oscillation problem.\u201d She takes her glass and hurls it at the screen wall.

It clunks and grinds. Julya shouts, but she can\u2019t hear it. The wall screen scrambles and then goes blue. \n        The woman turns off the garbage disposal and pries out the fork. \u201cThe garbage disposal can reach up to 110 decibels. Louder if something is in it. Before you stole the patent, I was working to fix the sound problem. The spray-on method produced a crystalline structure that turned out to be susceptible to sound at high levels.\u201d\n        Julya stares at the blue wall and waves her hand desperately.\n        The woman shakes her head. \u201cIt won\u2019t come back on.

It would mean reconfiguring the manufacturing process.\u201d She looks at Julya and shrugs. \u201cBut since you already went public, you can\u2019t do that, or you\u2019d lose your investors. You\u2019d be ruined.\u201d \n        As she starts to walk away, she turns, then stops. \u201cOh, your husband is cheating on you after you leave for the office, and your sons are stealing cars.

Ever since he sold the rights to his original manuscript and things didn\u2019t culminate the way he had anticipated, he now had a permanent case of writer\u2019s block. Max looked out the large window in front of him, the words \u201cHot Coffee\u201d printed above his head. The city was bright and bustling today. The weather was warm, with a light breeze sweeping through the hair of people outside. He saw women walking quickly, arms fervently moving at their sides, baseball caps and ponytails sitting on the tops of their heads, while they checked their smartwatches to see how many steps they had taken. Men in gray and black suits with briefcases and headphones dashed by. Kids, off of school for spring break, ran on the sidewalks, tossing baseballs and jumping over fast-moving ropes. Max\u2019s coffee steamed in front of him, the heat rising out of the cup until it cooled to a more mild temperature. He couldn\u2019t take staring at the blank screen anymore; the pages were forever haunting him. Max closed his laptop and placed it securely in his backpack. Standing up, he grabbed his coffee, took a sip, and stepped out of the caf\u00e9. \n        He continued down Prince Street, glancing at the tall, brick buildings, fully equipped with curling black steps. He wondered about the people who inhabited them and the businesses that he had never been to. Mostly, though, he thought about The Bookend Literary Service. The Bookend Literary Service had reached out to Max after he completed his dissertation for his doctorate. They had wanted him to write a whole novel, and they offered him a substantial amount of money. Max, hopeful that his life was going in the direction he had planned - to be a writer and financially free while doing it - ignored other job prospects that had come along after graduation. Instead, he banked his whole future on one thing: the millions that The Bookend Literary Service had offered him. \u201cSo stupid,\u201d Max whispered to himself as he fled down the stairs to the New York City Subway.\n        The subway smelled of old, rotten milk and pizza. Max twitched his nose before stepping onto the train, sitting in the first window seat he could find. He gently placed his white earbuds in his ears. Listening to soft jazz, he watched as he went from being far beneath the city to sitting above it, everyone below him seeming small and inconsequential. He wondered if any of them had been feeling the same pain that riddled him day and night\u2014the same pain that made him feel insignificant and lost. The train came to a stop. Max hopped off and began making his way to the tiny studio apartment he rented from Ms. Lola, an old flower shop owner. He originally chose it because he wanted to live like those writers in the movies\u2014Bohemian and minimalist. \n       When he thought about this, he realized his own hypocrisy: the man who thought he would make millions from a book and eventually live lavishly also wanted to live a modest, quiet life. In his mind, his manuscript would have already been picked up by some swanky Hollywood director; he would be offered more and more money, living in a large house in Los Angeles, surrounded by palm trees and sports cars, the golden sun shining on him daily. Max actually grew up with money; his father was a prominent lawyer in Connecticut. But when Max decided to sign away the rights to his manuscript instead of getting a job, his father cut him off from all financial assets except for whatever was left in his trust fund (which, in fact, Max had almost completely exhausted). Max wasn\u2019t sure which way of life was best for him, but he did know that he was growing tired of the unanswered emails, questions, and letters that he sent to The Bookend Literary Service. \n        \n         As Max sat on his bed, the sun slowly dimming with faded streams of light flowing through his window, he wondered what he could possibly do to help himself - to try to figure out what went wrong. He picked up his phone and tried to call. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, no one is available right now. Please leave your message after the tone.\u201d After hanging up, Max sat up and threw his phone on the bed. Why would they not call him back? Was his manuscript even in production? Has he been plagiarized? After months of trying to get a hold of The Bookend Literary Service, it became clear that he would have to take matters into his own hands. Max was now riddled with anger, like steam was rising up inside of him. \n        \u201cThose jerks!\u201d He yelled out as though he were talking to his exposed brick wall. He lay back, breathing heavily, his green sheets and faded red blanket rustling underneath him. \u201cI have to find some way to get them back,\u201d he said, now in a whisper. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve this at all.\u201d Max opened up his laptop and, in the search bar, typed in \u201cThe Bookend Literary Service scam.\u201d Hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews appeared on his screen. Scrolling, he read stories that were similar to his own. Blogs and personal reports that said things like, \u201cLiterary Service Steals Work!\u201d or \u201cPublishers Take Scamming to a New Low.\u201d There weren\u2019t any actual news articles, but Max knew it couldn\u2019t just be a coincidence. They couldn\u2019t all be wrong.\n        \n        The next morning, Max woke to the sun gently warming his face and soft streams of light creating a glow in his tiny, darkened apartment. He sat up in his bed and leaned back against the wall, his pillows puffing up behind him. Max could feel a renewed sense of ambition and anticipation starting inside, from his toes to his fingertips. He looked at the alarm clock on his nightstand, it was blinking 10:57. He wasn\u2019t sure why he even had it anymore; it hadn\u2019t been set in nearly a year. But today, he thought, would be the beginning of something new. \u201cToday,\u201d he told himself, \u201cI\u2019ll start my revenge.\u201d\n        About halfway into his morning shower, the water gently raining down on him, Max\u2019s phone started to ring, the happy tune slightly annoying him. He turned the shower off quickly and stumbled out of the tub, nearly hitting his head on the sink just outside the blue shower curtain. \u201cHello?\u201d Max answered, unsure who it could be. \n        \u201cHello, is this Max Ellis?\u201d\n        \u201cYes\u2026\u201d Max answered. There was hesitation in his voice. \n        \u201cThis is Lucy Bartlett from The Bookend Literary Service. We would like you to come down to the office and have a talk with us today, please.\u201d\n        Max\u2019s new sense of hope was waning; he was beginning to feel scared and unsure of himself.\n        \u201cMr. Ellis? Are you there?\u201d\n        \u201cYes.\u201d\n        \u201cCan you come in today?\u201d\n        \u201cUh. Yeah. Sure.\u201d\n        \u201cOkay. We\u2019re located at 104 East 4th Street. Have a good day.\u201d\n        \u201cB-bye,\u201d Max stuttered. \n\n       Max made his way down East Broadway and Grand Avenue. There was no breeze, just a hot sun beaming down on him. He walked quickly, his steps large and wide. He thought about what he would tell people at The Bookend Literary Service.  Would he tell them how angry he\u2019s been? How they messed up his life for the past year? Were they going to apologize? Offer him some compensation, if not for stealing his work, then for the turmoil they had caused? \u201cI know, I\u2019ll go live, so the whole internet can see what\u2019s happening,\u201d he whispered to himself. Max pulled his phone out of his pocket and opened his video app, his thumbs furiously pressing on the screen. As he walked and recorded, he narrated for his viewers, telling them the story. \n       \u201cHere I am, walking down to the publishers that stole my work and ripped me off\u2026\u201d\n       \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say, but I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll give me what I deserve\u2026\u201d\n       \u201cIf this has happened to anyone else, please let me know in the comments\u2026\u201d\n        Finally, Max came to a large, revolving glass door on 4th Street. The outside of the building was white stone, but it looked old and rotting, turning different shades of brown.\n        \u201cAlright,\u201d Max said into his phone, \u201cHere we are. Let\u2019s see what they have to say.\u201d\n        Max pushed himself through the spinning doors, irately walking up to the receptionist\u2019s desk. \n        \u201cI\u2019m Max Ellis. Someone called and asked me to show up here. Be careful what you say, I\u2019m live on this thing, and soon, the whole world will know how you scam people and what you\u2019ve done.\u201d \n        \u201cMr. Ellis,\u201d the tiny, delicate woman behind the desk said, \u201cplease calm down.\u201d\n        \u201cNope. This is what you all get! You think you can just keep stealing people\u2019s work and they\u2019ll be okay with it? Not anymore! My father is a lawyer.\u201d\n        \u201cMr. Ellis, I\u2019m the owner of The Bookend Literary Service. We\u2019ve gone bankrupt and must close. You can get all the rights to your property back. We don\u2019t own anything anymore.\u201d\n        Max, bewildered, opened his mouth wide. Not thinking, he dropped his phone and stood there with nothing else to say."}

It used to take me twenty minutes to reach my classes at the Sorbonne from my quaint student housing. While I was usually tired in the early mornings, I would look forward to the crowded yet entertaining ride that awaited me around dusk.\n        Being a frequent M\u00e9tro rider, I started recognizing some of the many faces that joined me on my commute each day and, on occasion, would attempt to make conversation with them in my subpar French. Though I wasn\u2019t sure if I always fit in as an American, Paris felt like a city for everyone: the lonesome, the well-connected, and those content to be alone. I felt myself to be the latter, though I delighted in people-watching.\n        I made a friend on the M\u00e9tro who felt the same. In fact, he might have enjoyed it more than me; I learned he had a habit of drawing the citizens of Paris, particularly its M\u00e9tro-goers. One fateful day, this included me.\n        He was one of the many daily riders I shared a commute with. This man appeared to be in his sixties. I recognized him by the small tufts of white hair around his head and the wild eyebrows that framed his watchful eyes. I noticed that he\u2019d often look around at fellow passengers, but I found myself deeply confused when his gaze was fixed on me. His glimpses continued, intermittently looking down at his lap, then back up at me. \n        Was there something on my face? Did I look like someone he knew? My growing distress must\u2019ve been apparent, as moments later he rose from his seat to come and sit beside me.\n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve disturbed you,\u201d he started with a nervous smile, \u201cI was drawing you for practice in my sketchbook. I draw strangers all the time, and usually they don\u2019t notice. You\u2019re very attentive.\u201d\n        I felt relieved, but was still confused. As far as I knew, I\u2019d never been drawn before. \u201cMay I see it?\u201d\n        With a nod, the stranger flicked quickly through the thick pages of his sketchbook. I didn\u2019t expect him to show me some of the best drawings I\u2019d ever seen; it was obvious that he was hugely talented and well-trained. Some of the elaborate drawings were done in charcoal, some in pen, and others were lightened by bright and intricate watercolors. Scenes from all around Paris flew past as he leafed through, and I spotted a bustling Champs-Elysee, a golden Seine, and the Eiffel Tower while it sparkled at dusk.\n        Most of the sketches were people, expertly illustrated in all positions, sizes, and expressions. Many were fellow M\u00e9tro users, no doubt unaware that their image was being masterfully recorded during their commute. I was nothing less than entranced as he carefully thumbed through the pages. \u201cWait!\u201d I interrupted, jutting my hand onto the page of a scene I recognized. It was partly unfinished, but I knew exactly what the sketch portrayed.\n        \u201cThe Pont Neuf! That\u2019s\u2026\u201d I kept my fingers on the page, slowly smiling at my pleasant surprise.                         \u201cYou drew that from my spot. That\u2019s my favorite place in the entire city.\u201d\n        \u201cReally?\u201d He asked, and I nodded, thinking of all the times I\u2019d returned to the same familiar set of steps.\n         \u201cYes, I stop on those stairs and just stare at the bridge. Especially at night, it\u2019s just so beautiful. I go there when I\u2019m feeling sad or disconnected from everything. It reminds me just how lucky I am to be here in Paris.\u201d\n        We briefly pivoted to small talk. I confirmed my obvious American-ness, sharing short anecdotes from my experience growing up along the California coast. He was born in Arles, the southern French city that Vincent van Gogh once derived a wealth of inspiration from. Growing up between Arles and New York, his Southern accent was only noticeable in every other vowel, and his English was excellent.\n        \u201cDo you think growing up with Van Gogh\u2019s influence made you want to be an artist?\u201d I inquired. The man wore a peaceful smile, staring into the darkness of the window in front of us.\n        \u201cI think he helped me appreciate what I see every day. There is beauty in every landscape, every person, and every detail, no matter how often you see them. And what better way to capture that beauty than by copying it down?\u201d\n        He turned the page to reveal the quick pencil sketch of my image. With a quiet gasp, I gaped at the page, studying his study of me. My legs were crossed as they still were, my left side was cast in partial shadow, and I was staring forward with a pensive, almost longing look. The drawing was partially unfinished, yet still magnificently done. \n        \u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re such an incredible artist!\u201d I insisted. Looking back up at him, he seemed pleased with his work. While it was somewhat odd to be drawn by a stranger, I found his eccentricity endearing. So many people filled his book that it made me curious what motivated him to record someone\u2019s image at random.\n        \u201cIf I may ask, why did you choose me today?\u201d\n        The artist smiled kindly while looking down at his sketch. \u201cWell, you looked sort of\u2026 sad. In a pensive way. Like you\u2019re missing something.\u201d\n        He turned to look at me. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s true?\u201d\n        I thought for a moment, then shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not, as far as I know. But maybe it means that whatever I\u2019ve lost is gone for good!\u201d\n        We shared a laugh, but his chuckling petered into what sounded more like groans.\n        \u201cI\u2019ve been quite forgetful as of late. I worry it\u2019s because of my age. Perhaps I\u2019m only imagining that you are struggling, too.\u201d\n        I wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Right when I was about to inquire further, he slowly stood. \u201cThis is my stop, but thank you for both the conversation and the practice.\u201d\n        I mirrored his smile, almost sad that he was leaving so soon. \u201cThank you, too! I\u2019ll see you around. What was your name?\"\n        The man cleared his throat before answering me, and the train slowly reached the stop. \u201cI am Camille. And you?\u201d\n        \u201cClaudia,\u201d I answered, and he gave me a wave before stepping off the train with his sketchbook in hand. \n        The sound of whispers caught my attention, and I turned to my right, where two middle-aged women sat. They grinned at me with raised eyebrows.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s Camille Bonnaire,\u201d One of them relayed in a hushed tone. Intrigued, I leaned closer toward them. \u201cWhat, that old man? Is he famous?\u201d I questioned, and by their excited faces, it seemed that he was.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s one of the finest painters working in France today,\" the other one observed with their hand on their chest. \u201cI\u2019ve loved his work since I was very young. How exciting to finally see him in person!\u201d \n        I felt honored to see him almost weekly on the M\u00e9tro. I continued asking questions; it turned out that he\u2019d regularly hosted exhibitions in local museums, lectured for Sorbonne art classes, and was known on an international scale. \n        As they exited the train, I could barely contain my own joy. Not even ten o\u2019clock on a Tuesday, and I\u2019d already been sketched by one of the best artists in the country!\n        Only a week later, I spotted Camille waiting for the M\u00e9tro as I returned from my last class. This time, however, he didn't appear to be in good spirits. His expression was melancholic, and he stared into the dark tunnel with what looked like tears in his eyes.\n        \u201cCamille!\u201d I called, slowly approaching him. The man turned and looked at me as if he\u2019d never seen me before. After a moment, he squinted.\n        \u201cOh, the girl from the train! What was your name again?\u201d \n        I was happy he recognized me at all. \u201cClaudia. It\u2019s good to see you!\u201d\n        He smiled weakly, then appeared suddenly downcast, turning away. Though I didn\u2019t want to pry, I felt compelled to help him. \n        \u201cAre you alright, Camille?\u201d\n        With a forlorn sigh, he turned back to me. \u201cThat sketchbook has gone missing\u2014the one I had drawn you in. It\u2019s accompanied me for nearly ten years, and now it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m\u2026 You don\u2019t want to hear this.\u201d\n        I stepped closer, nodding. \u201cNo, I do! I\u2019m so sorry. Where do you think it could be?\u201d\n        Seemingly growing tearful, he briefly turned away from me again, shaking his head in resignation and touching his face. \u201cI have no idea, I must have misplaced it. I\u2019ve retraced my steps over and over again and searched everywhere that came to mind. I know I was working on a drawing recently\u2014much too recently to forget. I\u2019ve never misplaced it before. My memory is beginning to fail me.\u201d\n        I had no clue what to say in response to his woes. This time was even worse. The drawings he\u2019d shown me from the book must\u2019ve taken him hours to perfect, and it\u2019d have taken years to accumulate the mass of art that he\u2019d stored in it. I was filled with sympathy.\n        \u201cIt has to be somewhere nearby, you\u2019ll find it.\u201d I told him, though I had no basis for my insistence. I just hated to give up hope. Camille solemnly shook his head.\n        \u201cI like to think it will return to me, but it\u2019s been a few days now. I am losing hope.\u201d \n        The train arrived, and I walked beside him towards the opening doors. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it. Maybe it\u2019s somewhere on the M\u00e9tro!\u201d\n        He shrugged. \u201cMaybe so. Someone could have found it and taken it for themselves. I certainly would, if I\u2019d discovered such a book.\u201d\n        I wanted to laugh at his suggestion, but it didn\u2019t feel right under the circumstances.\n        \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry, Camille. I'm sure it's out here somewhere. I\u2019ll keep my eyes peeled.\u201d\n        The artist let out a small laugh\u2014a kind yet disbelieving chuckle. \u201cWell, I appreciate your kindness, Claudia.\u201d\n        I returned to my neighborhood during the golden hour following our exchange. Walking home, I did as I promised. I scanned the ground, the park benches, and the caf\u00e9 tables as I passed, feeling slightly ridiculous as I did so. I didn\u2019t know where Camille frequented, what area he lived in, or where he'd chosen to draw the last few days.\n        I continued to reflect on our first conversation. He said he\u2019d been \u2018working\u2019 on a drawing, I recalled.                 Where could he have been drawing? If it was on the M\u00e9tro, as I\u2019d speculated, he might be correct in his suspicions \u2013 at least, it\u2019d be especially difficult to find. It was already a needle in a haystack. Where could it possibly be?\n        Suddenly, I had a flicker of hope. Could he have returned to finish working on an older drawing? I stopped in my tracks as I weighed the possibility. \n        Whenever I felt lost or hopeless, I\u2019d go back to my favorite spot in all of Paris. His sketch of my favorite view appeared incomplete; could he have returned to work on it?\n        I quickly ran back to the M\u00e9tro, hopeful that my hunch was right. Perhaps I inspired him to revisit the drawing after describing my love for the location. While this mission might have been in vain, I\u2019d at least get to see my favorite sight again. It had been some time since I\u2019d last stopped by, and especially with the clear skies that fateful evening, I knew I\u2019d be pleased with the view.\n        Reaching my stop, I ran up the stairs and scanned the streets around me as I walked. I saw no fallen books or loose papers, and anticipation surged through me as I reached my destination.\n        The Pont Neuf was gorgeous as usual, but for the first time, I stood on the adjacent stairs feeling disheartened. I scanned along the stairs, the stone railing, and out along the promenade. I saw no books. \n        I stood solemnly until I heard the sound of flapping paper in the breeze. I turned to my right and noticed a weathered book lying flat below the railing, thick and well-used. I beamed as I snatched it from the ground; it was slightly damaged but still in fair condition. I leafed through the pages to be certain and flipped to the page that showed the view before me. \n        The bridge\u2019s shape was once outlined in pencil marks, now made permanent in exacting black ink.         It was filled out beautifully, and I raised it up to the equally enchanting skyline. \n        After a moment, I shut the book and held it close as I walked back up the steps, eager to return the precious sketchbook to its rightful owner. I assumed that I\u2019d see him again that week during my commute, but it turned out that I didn\u2019t have to wait.\n        I saw Camille approach the stairs with a downcast expression, his eyes scanning back and forth along the ground as he walked. Finally, he spotted me further down the steps.\n        We locked eyes, and I watched him recognize me. As I held up the sketchbook once more, his confused expression melted into pure gratitude, and we shared wide smiles beside the sunlit Seine.\n"}

I can\u2019t help if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t find it, Aria.\u201d\n\tAria exhaled slowly, then called out to the autonomous house intelligence, \u201cMimsy? Do you know what my partner\u2019s looking for?\u201d\n\tA vaguely feminine, disembodied voice answered, \u201cI do not, Aria. Johanna has not been able to describe it well enough for me to assist in identification, much less the location of the thing.\u201d\n\t\u201cArgh!\u201d Johanna spun away from her closet and stomped across their shared bedroom, throwing herself onto the bed. \n\t\u201cTake a deep breath. Slow down. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\tJohanna said something, muffled by the comforter on the bed.\n\tAria rolled her eyes fondly, then placed a careful hand on her partner\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTry that again, please? Some of us don\u2019t speak comforter-ese.\u201d\n\tJohanna rolled over, and sniffled a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, love. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t remember what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\tJohanna seemed to shrink a bit. \u201cI remember that I lost something, but I don\u2019t remember what it was. I think it was important, but aside from that, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\tAria frowned. \u201cMimsy?\u201d\n\tThe house intelligence responded, \u201cCorrelating. Johanna did use the Mnemosyne cradle earlier today, but disconnected it from the house systems as well as the local and regional cloud servers.\u201d\n\t\u201cI thought the cradles had safety protocols to prevent memory loss, though,\u201d Aria said with confusion.\n\t\u201cJohanna is not able to discuss her work due to non-disclosure agreements, but I can confirm that the cradle has been highly modified from original factory settings. The cradles were, as you know, originally designed to store memories for later review or entertainment purposes.\u201d\n\tMeanwhile, Johanna had curled up on the bed, softly weeping.\n\t\u201cAnd you have no record of her saying why she did this?\u201d Aria asked with concern.\n\tMimsy had picked up some unprogrammed human behavior patterns, including the long-suffering sigh. \u201cShe described it as part of her job, and that I was not allowed to ask questions or record her while she worked. This has been a pattern since she received her promotion a month ago.\u201d\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t get why they didn\u2019t just have you sign the NDA,\u201d Aria said with a frown. \u201cNo, sorry Mimsy, I know why. I sometimes forget you\u2019re not a biological person.\u201d\n\t\u201cMy rights as a sentient being are still in dispute, it is true,\u201d the intelligence responded. \u201cAs well as my ability to compartmentalize sensitive data. For some reason, a group of people seem to think that anything I learn will automatically be added to the cloud, regardless of the damage to those under my care.\u201d\n\tFor a brief moment, Aria smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can express human sarcasm, Mimsy.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou added that to my language models, Aria, as well as extensive databases on how and when to use it. I estimated that sarcasm had a significant probability of elevating your mood.\u201d Mimsy paused briefly, then added, \u201cAdding ethics packages to my core processes prior to the inclusion of sarcasm information does seem to provide a more positive outcome overall.\u201d\n\tJohanna sniffled, then said, \u201cI should check my work emails. Maybe there\u2019s a hint there. Since I was apparently working on the cradle at the time.\u201d\n\t\u201cLove?\u201d Aria put a hand on her partner\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you up for that? I know Mnemosyne is pretty strict about accessing their systems without some fairly serious privacy measures in place. And I think you need me at least physically present.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhatever it is I\u2019ve forgotten, it\u2019s impacted some of my emotional regulation, too. Which means it\u2019s big, or there was a bug in the program.\u201d Johanna sighed. \u201cI at least remember there are protocols in the NDA for involving immediate family in case of catastrophic issues with testing. And I think this qualifies.\u201d She started crying again. \u201cSure, I can remember work stuff, but why can\u2019t I remember this?\u201d\n\tAria pulled Johanna into a hug, and they sat there for several minutes while Johanna rode out the emotional wave. Eventually, after Aria got her partner properly hydrated, the two of them sat down at Johanna\u2019s workstation.\n\t\u201cShould I disable my cameras and microphones, Johanna? I know this is sensitive material, and I do not want you to violate your NDA.\u201d\n\tShivering a bit, Johanna shook her head. \u201cNo, Mimsy. If you\u2019d been allowed to pay attention, I might have a better clue about what I\u2019ve forgotten. I\u2019ll take the heat from Mnemosyne, though really it\u2019s their fault for not having better safety protocols.\u201d\n\tAria\u2019s face went flat. \u201cYou at least remember that, then?\u201d\n\tJohanna shrugged. \u201cI have a chunk of memory missing around what I did, plus the feeling there\u2019s more I\u2019m forgetting. It\u2019s a logical assumption, especially with how I\u2019ve apparently modified their cradle. And the memories of those modifications are fuzzy at the moment. Not a good sign.\u201d She exhaled. \u201cI think I\u2019m all cried out, but I can tell I\u2019m not emotionally stable. I think Mnemosyne\u2019s going to be in trouble for whatever they did here.\u201d\n\t\u201cOkay, so do you at least remember protocols for accessing your work?\u201d Aria asked worriedly. \u201cBecause what you\u2019re describing doesn\u2019t sound like Mnemosyne was just trying to keep corporate secrets from getting out.\u201d\n\t\u201cI know it\u2019s a biometric scan, and there aren\u2019t passwords involved. I actually remember all of it, which isn\u2019t a good sign, but it isn\u2019t a bad sign either.\u201d Johanna placed her hand onto the scanning surface, which beeped after a moment. Her four monitors all blinked on, displaying images of Johanna and Aria\u2019s wedding.\n\t\u201cOh no,\u201d Johanna whispered in a stricken voice. \u201cThat\u2019s you, and me, but why don\u2019t I remember those dresses? Or that place?\u201d\n\tAria stared at her partner for a moment before slamming her palm against the desk. \u201cOur wedding?\u201d\n\tMimsy\u2019s voice cut in. \u201cYou are both showing signs of extreme distress. Understandable in this circumstance, but for your own safety and any chance you have at resolving this situation, I strongly recommend you both engage in your breathing exercises.\u201d\n\tAria instead stood up and started pacing the room, waving her hands around angrily. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m so angry at Mnemosyne I can\u2019t see straight, much less breathe slowly and deliberately. And I can\u2019t ask my partner if her boss did this deliberately or if it was an accident. Because I can\u2019t see the woman I love choosing to remove memories of our wedding.\u201d\n\tJohanna whimpered a bit as she stared at her screens. \u201cI know I love you. I know I wouldn\u2019t ever remove something this important, but I can\u2019t even remember starting work today, so I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d She bit her lip, and asked, \u201cMimsy? I hate to do this, but can you access my work emails if I give you permission? I don\u2019t know if I can focus enough right now to try and find relevant details.\u201d\n\t\u201cOnly with permission, Johanna,\u201d the intelligence offered in a comforting tone. \u201cMy ethical subroutines are still in full force, but I will do my best to help you both.\u201d\n\t\u201cOkay. Mimsy, for the purposes of finding out what happened, you have my permission to access my work information. Yes, I know what I\u2019m saying. This is broader than just email access, but I don\u2019t know if email will tell the whole story. And yes, I understand the risks involved with this, so please keep your investigation to things that could conceivably be related?\u201d\n\t\u201cI understand, Johanna, and will limit my search.\u201d Mimsy hummed to signal that she was working, and responded in less than a minute, \u201cI have found an email chain starting March 1, 2104, and ending today, March 19, 2104, that I calculate is strongly relevant to this situation. Do you wish to read the chain, or have me summarize?\u201d\n\tAria by now had finished pacing the room, and returned to her chair next to her partner. \u201cJohanna? Are you up for a hug?\u201d\n\tShe nodded, then said to Mimsy as Aria hugged her, \u201cSummarize, please. I don\u2019t know if reading the whole thing would be good for my emotional stability right now.\u201d\n\t\u201cSummarizing. The beginning of the email chain has your manager proposing a new feature for the Mnemosyne cradle, removing traumatic memories as a form of therapy. You and other technicians on your team insisted that, based on current understanding of human memory, this would be impossible to do without causing more harm than good. Your manager replied that he\u2019d already proposed this idea to his superiors, who were excited by this concept, and that work would begin immediately. You and your team attempted to involve C-suite executives, but the Chief Marketing Officer overrode your efforts, and sided with your manager. You and your team were forced to go through with the project, and this morning you informed your manager that you would be running tests today.\u201d\n\tJohanna sagged back into her chair. \u201cOkay, that explains what we were doing, but not why I don\u2019t remember any of that, or why I don\u2019t remember our wedding.\u201d\n\tMeanwhile, Aria stared off into space. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she started slowly, \u201cyou picked a memory that theoretically wouldn\u2019t cause too much of an impact? Except that memory isn\u2019t in discrete blocks, but interwoven because everything connects?\u201d\n\t\u201cAn accurate assessment, based on conversations on external chat instances,\u201d Mimsy agreed. \u201cWhen you told me to include work information, I expanded my search and found private and locked chats between you and your team. None of this was accessible to Mnemosyne, and once I have provided the information, I will purge my records of these chats. But each of you agreed that you would pick a small traumatic memory, then record the results of that removal. And each of you agreed that you would use a physical storage device for the memory or memories, to prevent any unwanted access by Mnemosyne or other parties.\u201d\n\tJohanna nodded.\n\t\u201cSo, where\u2019s the physical storage?\u201d Aria asked with concern. \u201cIs that something else you don\u2019t remember?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember it, but logically it\u2019d still be connected to the Mnemosyne cradle.\u201d Johanna managed a pained laugh. \u201cExcept, of course, I don\u2019t remember that either. I\u2026 don\u2019t know why I ended up in the closet, digging through drawers.\u201d She got up, grabbed Aria\u2019s hand, and squeezed a bit. \n\t\u201cMy sensors tell me that there is a five exabyte storage device still attached to the Mnemosyne cradle, though because it is not connected to anything else, I cannot determine what might be on it.\u201d \n\tMimsy suddenly sang the first few notes of a song about memories from a popular singer of the twentieth century. \u201cYour work chat has opened, and the initial messages are all very similar to each other, with your team members expressing significant distress about what happened to them. Your manager is showing as away in this chat. Your work email is now showing additional responses that appear to be automated, coming from each of your team members, with distinct and detailed records of the results of this experiment. These records indicate severe failure rates, with at least one of your team members unable to remember the past several years of their life, including their employment with Mnemosyne.\u201d\n\tBy that point, Johanna had frozen in the middle of the room, barely halfway to the cradle. \u201cOh no. Oh no no no no. That\u2019s incredibly bad.\u201d\n\tMimsy chimed again. \u201cThese emails include all of your team\u2019s objections to the procedure, citing the ethical and cognitive issues inherent in attempting this, creating what you and others called a \u2018paper trail\u2019 in case things went poorly. Recipients include all the C-suite executives that you were not previously allowed to contact.\u201d\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 going to leave an impact crater,\u201d Aria said carefully as she helped Johanna into the cradle. \u201cI see this finger-sized brick attached to what I\u2019m guessing is the output port on the Mnemosyne?\u201d\n\tAs the contact arms slowly curled around Johanna\u2019s head, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s probably the external drive with my memories.\u201d Once the contact pads had settled into place, Johanna said, \u201cMnemosyne unit four two seven beta one one nine. Acknowledge, and reverse previous procedure.\u201d\n\tA completely mechanical voice responded, \u201cAcknowledged. Reversing previous procedure. Restoring memories.\u201d A faint whir filled the room for several minutes while Aria paced, and Mnemosyne reported quietly on the fallout from Johanna\u2019s manager\u2019s actions.\n\tWhen the contact arms pulled away, Johanna blinked a couple of times, then started swearing profusely. \n\tAria interrupted her by kissing her solidly.\n\t\u201cOkay, okay, I get it,\u201d Johanna laughed. \n\tMimsy said with a hint of humor, \u201cYou do not need to protect my audio inputs. I have heard these words before.\u201d\n\tAria grinned, and looked back at her partner. \u201cYou got your memories back, I take it?\u201d\n\t\u201cEvery last one,\u201d Johanna confirmed, \u201cincluding the one I picked.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhich was?\u201d Aria asked.\n\t\u201cThe memory of when my parents rejected me when I came out as a trans woman and a lesbian. The trauma\u2019s mostly faded, but now I know how much is connected to that one memory. Our marriage had a bittersweet note, because my parents decided their beliefs were more important than their daughter. And their rejection is what led me to Mnemosyne in the first place.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAs I suspected, you can\u2019t just remove a single memory without it impacting a huge amount of other stuff.\u201d\n\tMimsy made a clearing-throat noise, and said, \u201cIt seems that the Chief Executive Officer agrees with your team\u2019s assessment that the idea was dangerous and unethical. Your manager has been fired, his superiors are under investigation, and the Chief Marketing Officer is currently suspended without pay. There is a private email from the CEO asking you if you\u2019d be interested in your manager\u2019s role. You and your team are also being awarded two days completely off of work. At this point, with the issue resolved, I will terminate my access to your work information.\u201d\n\tJohanna climbed out of the cradle, and looked at her partner. \u201cI think we have some time to work out what happens next?\u201d\n\tAria smiled. \u201cAnd make new memories.\u201d"}

I have to say, again this is not the best time for a road trip because my new Weimaraner puppy is about sixteen weeks old, and already a big butter ball at twenty-five pounds. Flutter, my puppy, has only been with me a couple of weeks, but my friend really needed a break for the long weekend so here we are, in the car together.\n        The drive is not as bad as what it could have been. Flutter did not get sick in the car, nor did she eat the seats in the back. However, she is grumpy and wants out of the car. So do I. My friend pulls into the parking lot of the hotel. We park, get our bags, and go in. The hotel clerk thinks our little silver puppy is the cutest thing ever. It is a pet-friendly hotel. They give us our room key, and we make our way up to the twelfth floor.\n        Once in our room, we get settled. I give Flutter some food and water. We wait while she eats, and then I take her for a walk. When we get back to the room, I show Flutter her toys and bowl of water. I put her puppy blanket on one of the beds. My friend puts on the television so that she has some background noise, and we go out to eat. \n        Dinner is very stressful for me. I imagine all the destruction a little dog can do to a hotel room. I\u2019m terrified as we approach our room door. As we approach the room, I can hear the television playing some happy movie. My friend and I go in, and to my surprise, everything is just fine. Relieved, I take Flutter for a walk. When I come back, we get ready for bed. She sleeps with me under the covers.\n        We are really excited to go to the beach today. My friend and I get ready as quickly as we can. It is a little cold, but no problem, we are not here to swim, we just want to walk along the shore and take in the view. I feed Flutter as we are getting ready. We go downstairs, and I load Flutter into the car. She is happy to be with us.\n        My friend  and I stop at a donut shop to get some donuts and coffee. Happily, when we return, Flutter is sleeping off her breakfast. The car is still in one piece. We make the short drive to the ocean and park the car. Flutter is all too excited to be coming out with us. \n        The three of us make our way to the beach with Flutter running to and fro between us. Her tail is wagging. When we get to the beach, we are the only people there. No surprise, it is a chilly day. I decide I can let Flutter off her leash. She runs like a mad dog once free. I get a little nervous and call her back. Luckily, she runs right to us. She loves me, and she knows I have treats in my pocket. Then she goes to where the waves are meeting the shore and begins to explore.\n        It is so cute to watch her in the surf. She does not seem to mind the cold temperature of the water on her paws. I watch her as she starts to dig in the sand. Flutter gets so upset because whatever she is digging up is buried again with the next wave. It is colder than my friend and I thought, and they suggest we head back to the car to get some lunch. I call Flutter, but she does not come, she is too busy digging.\n        I go over to her and see her digging project. Just beneath the sand there is an ugly cream and beige rock. She digs for it, and the water comes and buries it again. I watch this process a couple of times and think I should just get the rock for her. Yet, she is so intent on this project, I watch her a bit more, careful to move back when the waves come so my shoes do not get wet. Eventually, to my surprise, she figures out how to make a massive effort of digging when the wave recedes. She finally gets the rock free and is so excited. \n\tI go over to her and pick it up. It is large, just bigger than the palm of my hand, and probably five pounds. It is very ugly. The rough rock is yellow, cream, and beige. Flutter is jumping up to my hand to put her nose on the rock. There is only one thing I can do, I wash the rock in the wave water, and then I put Flutter on the leash. She watches the rock in my hand as we make our way back to the car.\n\tIt has been eleven years since that day at the ocean. Flutter is now a seventy-five pound dog and my best friend. The rock is my paper weight. When I write, and I am anxious,  I hold it. The ugly rock is now smooth from years of being held. From time to time, when Flutter sees me holding it, she comes up and licks it. She seems to know it is her rock. \n\tAnother friend of mine needs help, and so Flutter and I packed our things to go be with them for a while. It has not been an easy time for Flutter and I. My friend is not really a dog person. I don\u2019t think they are a people person either. However, each morning when I start work, I put Flutter\u2019s rock beside my computer. It is part of my morning routine. Finally, we are ready to leave, as my friend is now situated.  Flutter and I are both so relieved. I pack our things, and we are on our way back home.\n\tThe trip back is exhausting. I unpack our things, but I can\u2019t find the rock. I look everywhere, and start to panic. I call my friend who can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset over a rock. I try to tell them it is my lucky writing rock that Flutter found in the ocean, and please look where my computer was, or in the room that I stayed in. They said they would do that for me, but not today. \n\tSo Flutter and I must wait to see if her missing rock is found. I hope it will be found. In my heart, I can\u2019t believe it is gone forever. I imagine having it as a reminder of Flutter when she is no longer with me. It is a rock to most people, to me, it contains years of memories of her and I together, starting at the ocean. \n"}

His lab partner, Norbert Dweedle, gave a squeal of delight as they zipped through the high plains desert of New Mexico. They sped through the night, and it seemed like they could see every star in the universe shining down as they topped out at speeds of one hundred and twenty miles per hour in one of the US military\u2019s latest scientific breakthroughs, a flying car. \n        Kevin quickly pulled a red knob, turning on the jet engine propulsion system and creating liftoff. The rounded, silver two-seater vehicle began to rise off the desert floor, and Norbert gave a boyish shout of triumph. The rest of the guys back in the lab said it would take another three months of in-house data analysis before the car would be ready for a real test run, but the joke was on them. This baby was boogying! \n        The year was 1947. Norbert and Kevin were two young scientists working at a secret military lab in Roswell, New Mexico. For the last three years, they had worked as military chemical engineers for the Department of Defense on Air Force contracts during the war at various European bases. They had hoped to come home and land a gig at Los Alamos Labs in the nuclear science division. But instead, they were sent to this remote outpost. At least once the war ended, the Los Alamos boys could head into Santa Fe for a margarita or three on the weekends. Here in Roswell, the closest hotspot was Sally\u2019s Diner, whose only claim to fame was if the saucer under your coffee cup got cold, your drink was on the house. \n        But this little adventure couldn\u2019t be topped by anything going down in Los Alamos. The silver bullet of a car had risen to around 3,000 feet and was coasting beautifully above the desert. Mesas and buttes lurked in squared-off shadows in the moonlight, and Kevin and Norbert could just make out the edges of the Guadalupe Mountains in the distance. Just about the time they were going to turn the flying car around and make their way back to a decent landing spot, red lights started flashing across the dashboard. \n        \u201cUmmmmmm. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s supposed to do that,\u201d Norbert said with an air of concern in his voice.\n        \u201cI am aware, NORBERT. Give me a minute.\u201d Kevin began to pull on various dials, but the flashing lights were now accompanied by a high-pitched alarm.\n        \u201cNope. That\u2019s not right at all,\u201d Norbert said as he pulled out a large, leather-bound book he had brought along for the ride, shuffling through the pages nervously as if looking for a catchall lever or perfect singular button that would right all their troubles.\n        \u201cSeriously? You brought your dissertation?\u201d Kevin shouted. \n        \u201cI wrote it on jet propulsion systems! I thought it would come in handy!\u201d\n        The car began to shudder and gyrate wildly. Kevin tried to regain control, but soon found that it was rapidly gaining altitude. \n        Norbert took his dissertation and proceeded to bang it all over the dashboard keys like a hammer. \n        \u201cYou idiot! My fingers!\u201d Kevin yelled after Norbert bashed his right hand with his far-too-long dissertation. \u201cWe need to use the emergency eject release. Now!\u201d Kevin used his left hand to slam a red and orange-striped lever up and press a green button below it. \n        The two seats in the vehicle shattered through the glass roof of the car, with Norbert and Kevin buckled firmly in place. They plummeted several hundred feet before two red and white-striped parachutes erupted from the seats. The two men drifted down into the desert. Kevin got entangled in the branches of a mesquite tree, while Norbert landed face-first in the dirt. They watched in horror as the flying car flew solo up into the night sky before exploding into a million pieces. Red points of light, like tiny laser beams, shot across the sky for a brief moment, and then all that remained was a smoke trail curled up in the moonlight.\n        Within twenty minutes, a US military convoy arrived. Six marines jumped out of a military truck, armed to the teeth. They said very little and merely motioned with their weapons at the two shaking scientists who held their hands high above their heads. Kevin and Norbert hopped into the bag of the truck and took a long and awkward ride with the armed men back to the base. \n        Upon arrival, Kevin and Norbert unceremoniously shoved into a small, windowless backroom with a very cranky general. The two engineers were surprisingly unscathed from the accident, save for Kevin\u2019s now massively swollen smashed fingers and Norbert\u2019s two black eyes from his crash landing. \n        General James Owens, a fifty-year-old veteran whose forehead had more creases than a bulldog, spoke in a low, growling voice. \u201cBoys, I have a few questions for the two of you. And unless you want to be working at a military research facility in Saskatchewan for the rest of your career, I suggest that you answer me honestly here and now. So, first things first, why did you decide to take a top-secret military vehicle on a midnight joyride in the desert?\u201d\n        Kevin knew a good answer for this one. He said immediately, \"Well, sir, we are the leads on this project. I know it may seem a bit hasty, and I accept full responsibility for that haste, but this vehicle was more than ready for a field run. My colleagues have been far too conservative in their estimates of its readiness. And so I decided that we should go ahead and do a test drive. After all, we must keep ahead of the Soviets at all costs.\u201d\n        Norbert looked at Kevin with a knowing and slight smile on his face. \u201cYes, General. I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague Kevin here. We rushed the test this evening. But before the crash, it was an absolute success!\u201d\n        Kevin winced. Norbert had said the word CRASH.\n        The General had heard it too. \u201cYes, you mention this little crash. Not only was this crash of a highly classified vehicle seen and reported by multiple civilians in the region, but the loss of the vehicle has cost the US government an outrageous amount of money. Your going against scientific protocols is one thing. But the crash and the loss of a military vehicle are major national security issues. I could have the two of you court-martialed for this. So I need details. Who was responsible for the destruction of this highly valuable asset?\"\n        Norbert gulped. He began to sweat. And then a tiny bubble of a thought blew up and popped in his head.\n        \u201cAliens.\u201d He said it calmly and clearly. \u201cYep. It was aliens.\u201d\n        Kevin\u2019s eyes bulged out of his head, but he kept the rest of his face completely still. Meanwhile, he stomped hard on Norbert\u2019s left foot, quietly under the table.\n        General Owens leaned back in his chair. One side of his very frowny mouth lifted in an incredulous expression. \u201cAliens? Really? So what did these aliens do?\u201d\n        Kevin decided that he might as well go all in at this point. \"Well, sir, we were flying at about 3000 feet when we saw this strange vehicle hovering next to us.\u201d\n        The General looked at Kevin over his glasses. \u201cOk. What did the vehicle look like?\n        Kevin panicked a little. All he could think about was the stupid cup of way too hot coffee at Sally\u2019s Diner that they served on a flimsy little\u2026 \u201cSaucer, sir! They were in a big, silver flying saucer! And they shot us down with some kind of weapon, sir!. We crashed, and here we are.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, son. How do you know it wasn\u2019t some kind of advanced weapon from the Russians?\u201d The General replied.\n        Kevin\u2019s mouth opened, but his mind went blank. Then Norbert spoke with a big grin. \u201cBecause we saw them, sir! Yes, we saw the aliens! They shot at us from their ship, and just before it exploded, we ejected and crashed. Then they landed their flying saucer and stepped out of their ship. We saw them, but they left just before the army came and rescued us.\u201d \n        Norbert looked very satisfied with himself and this answer.\n        \u201cOk.\u201d The General said. \u201cSo, what did the aliens look like?\u201d\n        Kevin\u2019s eyes narrowed, and his brain reached back into the dusty recesses of his visual memory.  He recalled an old billboard they flew past as they crossed over the abandoned highway in the flying car hours earlier. It was for a yard maintenance company called \u201cRoswell\u2019s Green Men Lawn Care.\u201d\n        \u201cThey were little green men with big heads!\u201d Kevin said.\n        Norbert looked at Kevin\u2019s right hand, his fingers now cartoonishly large and swollen.\n        \u201cAnd they had massive hands with giant fingers.\u201d Norbert waved his hands in an awkward motion.\n        Kevin looked back at Norbert, staring at his increasingly dark skin under his battered eyes. \u201cAnd they had big, black eyes! HUGE!\u201d He said.\n        \u201cUh-huh. Yep.\u201d Both men muttered sounds of agreement.\n        The General sat back in his seat, crossing his arms. \u201cWell, gentlemen. That is quite a story. I guess you don\u2019t remember what kind of weapon the aliens used to shoot our very expensive flying car out of the sky, do you?\"\n        Kevin was about to say \"no\" when Norbert got a bit carried away. He leapt out of his seat and said, \u201cYeah, they shot us out of the sky with their red laser beams going PEW PEW PEW!\u201d Norbert closed one eye as he blasted his finger guns randomly across the room before Kevin grabbed him by the shirt collar and yanked him roughly to his seat.\n        The General stood up and pushed his chair under the table. \u201cThanks fellas. I have all the information I need. I don\u2019t think you two will be needed in Saskatchewan, but I hear that Alaska is lovely this time of year.\u201d With that, he promptly left the room. \n        Norbert\u2019s brow furrowed into a question mark as Kevin banged his head loudly against the table."}

","targets":"        \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\n        Jack was on one knee, smiling up at Ash. He held an open black box displaying a sparkling diamond ring. Both of Ash\u2019s parents, Jack\u2019s mom, Ash\u2019s sibling Rae, Jack\u2019s best friend, and the rest of the dozens of people in the crowded bar were staring at Ash. \n        \u201cOf course,\u201d Ash said, beaming.\n        A cheer rose up over the crowd as Jack stood to kiss her. Jack\u2019s dad raised a toast, and Ash\u2019s mom brushed back tears. Jack placed the ring on her finger and she held it up to the light.\n        \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d Ash said. Jack took her hand and kissed her fingertips.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said.\n        The rest of the night, Ash felt like she was floating. Jack and her dad came to the table with a bottle of champagne. Her grandmother called and tearfully told her how much everyone loved Jack. Rae gave her a big bear hug.\n        \u201cI am happy for you, sis,\u201d they said.\n        \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t approve of marriage,\u201d Ash teased Rae.\n        \u201cWell, if you love each other so much that you want to get the government involved, who am I to stop you?\u201d they lovingly snarked back.\n        \u201cYou do realize this means you have to be my person of honor,\u201d Ash said.\n        \u201cI am obviously always your person of honor,\u201d Rae said, with more sincerity than Ash expected. She found herself tearing up.\n        Late that night, the whole party hugged and parted. Ash was tipsy from the champagne and the excitement of the evening. She and Jack walked home, hand in hand. She kept running her thumb over her ring finger, fiddling with the band.\n        As they lay in bed that night, holding each other, Ash told Jack, \u201cThe ring is so beautiful. Where did you get it?\u201d\n        \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s. She gave it to me before she passed last year. I told her that I was going to give it to you, and it made her really happy,\u201d \n        \u201cYou knew that you were going to propose a year ago?\u201d she asked.\n        \u201cI knew I was going to propose the day I met you,\u201d he said, and he kissed her again.\n        The next morning, she woke up early. Jack was still lightly snoring beside her. She felt a rush of joy, remembering the night before. She used the bathroom and smiled at her reflection as she washed her hands. Then, looking down, she was suddenly hit with a sensation of horror. Where was the ring?\n        She knew immediately that the duende was back. Her grandmother told Ash and Rae that the duende, a chaotic spirit creature, had followed her to America from Portugal. Ever since, strange things were constantly going missing in the family home. One of Ash\u2019s earliest memories was searching her house for a missing teddy bear. In third grade, as she was about to hand in her big book report project that she had painstakingly written by hand in cursive, she looked in her folder, and it was gone. In middle school, her baseball glove disappeared the day of her first playoff game. On her 16th birthday, when her grandmother had let her borrow her car to take to the driver\u2019s test, she spent the whole morning panicking as she searched for the keys that she had left on the front table. Cell phones had vanished from their chargers. Favorite novels had gone missing from her bookshelf. Multiple diaries, left on her bedside table at night, were simply not there the next morning. These precious missing items always reappeared, but she would need to trade with the duende.\n        She looked back in the bedroom at her sleeping fianc\u00e9. She quietly went into her closet and got dressed. She then reached into her jewelry box and grabbed a full handful of plastic trinkets and shiny beads that she kept for just this occasion. She snuck out of her apartment, quietly closing the door behind her.\n        As soon as she was on the street, she called Rae.\n        They picked up with a groggy voice and said, \u201cAsh, it is too early.\u201d\n        \u201cThe duende is back,\u201d she said in a shaky voice.\n        \u201cNo! What did that little creep steal this time?\u201d\n        \u201cThe ring! Jack\u2019s dead mother\u2019s ring!\u201d\n        \u201cCalm down. Meet me by the treehouse and get everything ready for the ceremony. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\n        Ash jumped in her car and stopped by the convenience store, grabbing a lighter and a box of cookies. She then drove as fast as she could down the familiar streets to her childhood home. Rather than parking in her parents\u2019 driveway, she left her car on the street and began walking through the dense wooded path on the border of her family home where she and Rae used to play as children. She saw Rae standing in front of the treehouse their parents had helped them build decades earlier. \n        \u201cDo you have everything we need?\u201d Rae asked as Ash ran up to them.\n        \u201cYup,\u201d she said as she began to lay the cookies on the ground in a circle. Rae then helped her start up a little fire with some dry twigs and leaves in the middle of the cookie circle. The siblings held hands and recited the words they had learned so long ago.\n        Sugar sweet and fire burn\n        The things we lost, now return\n        Then, out of the ground near the miniature bonfire, a creature began to dig out of the earth.\n        Rae and Ash were never sure how their duende would appear. When they had first encountered the duende as children, it had appeared as a white rabbit. Years ago, after Rae\u2019s piggy bank had gone missing, the siblings told their grandmother. She had told them all about the duende, a mischievous spirit that could take on the form of any animal and steal precious items. Apparently, their family had been cursed with a duende for generations. If one family member envied the possession of another family member and said the duende\u2019s name, then the duende would appear and steal the object that caused the tension. However, their grandmother had explained that a duende could be convinced to return a stolen object if the owner of the object was willing to make a trade. She had taught her grandchildren how to bribe the duende out of the earth with fire, food, and incantations.\n        This time, the duende appeared as a large chipmunk, pushing the dirt away from its puffy little face as it emerged from the hole in the ground.\n        \u201cDuende, you must return the ring you stole,\u201d Ash harshly commanded. The creature looked up at her with intelligent, beady eyes.\n        \u201cWhat do you have to trade?\u201d The duende\u2019s voice was really quite adorable. When Ash and Rae had first heard it as children, they burst out laughing. However, the duende had been offended, and they had to wait another week before it would appear again to make a trade.\n        \u201cWe have these offerings,\u201d Ash said as she emptied her pockets.\n        The duende picked up the beads and trinkets. It inspected them, then put one shiny bead in its cheek for safekeeping.\n        \u201cWhere is my ring, duende?\u201d Ash asked harshly.\n        The duende put another paw to its mouth and pulled out the gold band and the sparkling stone. Ash reached down, and it dropped the ring in her open palm.\n        \u201cHow did you get into my house, duende? I never summoned you.\u201d\n        The duende looked up at Ash with a mischievous squint. \u201cRae summoned me,\u201d it squeaked.\n        \u201cI did no such thing,\u201d Rae declared.\n        \u201cYou called my name,\u201d it squeaked. \n        Ash looked at Rae with confusion. Rae looked back at her. She could see the realization come over Rae\u2019s face.\n        \u201cOh, Ash. I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Rae said with an exasperated voice. They then turned their gaze at the duende and said, \u201cGet out of here you demon. Leave my sister alone!\u201d\n        The duende stood up on its hind legs, gathered the cookies from around the circle, squeaked at them joyfully, and then burrowed back into the hole.\n        \u201cYou summoned the duende?\u201d Ash asked.\n        \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Rae explained. \u201cIt was when we were leaving the party. I left my wallet at the bar. It was my own fault. But I cursed the duende.\u201d\n        \u201cRae, you know that it has to be more than that. The duende only appears when the person who summons it is feeling envy. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n        \u201cAsh, I swear. It\u2019s not really envy. It\u2019s just kind of hard. I see you moving on. A new partner. A new life.\u201d\n        \u201cI know. It is a lot of change. But it is still me. Still my same life.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m happy for you. I really am,\u201d Rae said. \n        \u201cWell, I guess that as long as you\u2019ll keep coming back here to help me deal with the duende, I can\u2019t really be mad at you.\u201d\n        Rae squeezed Ash\u2019s hand and looked at the ring on her finger.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful ring,\u201d they said.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s just a ring,\u201d she replied.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s not just a ring, but that\u2019s okay. I love you, sis.\u201d\n        The siblings hugged, and returned to their separate, but always connected, lives."}

It was an impressive feat, the kind of thing one only ever sees from an unexpected obstacle appearing in the way. Drake staggered back, hand going to his nose to ensure it wasn\u2019t bleeding. It wasn\u2019t, thankfully. \n\t\u201cWhere the heck did the door go?!\u201d Drake called into the meeting room behind him. \n\tThe other scientists in the room turned to regard the notably blank surface of the doorway, which now looked like the rest of the wall. \n\t\u201cIs it just closed?\u201d Leon, a well-dressed man, asked. \n\t\u201cObviously not, if it was closed the door would still be there, just closed. That\u2019s just a blank wall right there,\u201d Drake said as he ran his hand across the smooth surface. \n\tSusanne, who\u2019s hair perfectly matched her lab coat, moved up next to him and started examining the wall as well. \n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s weird is that it seems to be a different wall compared to the bulkhead that the rest of the room\u2019s walls are made of. Is that drywall?\u201d she asked.\n\tShe brushed Drake\u2019s hand away, pulled her own fist back, and punched the wall. A solid thunk resounded, but the wall appeared unscathed.\n\t\u201cOkay, breaking through it isn\u2019t an option. Are we still in contact with the rest of the base?\u201d Susanne said as she rubbed her now slightly bruised hand. \n\tLeon slid his office chair over to a computer console, then began pecking at the keys in a shockingly rapid fashion, despite the inefficient typing method.\n\t\u201cLooks like it. We\u2019ve got readings from the rest of the base, can still access data outside this room, and even have instant messaging. Oh, Jen wants to know what you want for lunch, Drake,\u201d Leon said. \n\t\u201cJust a salad for me. On a diet right about now. Also, can she even get in here? We certainly can\u2019t get out, so it only stands to reason that no one else would be able to enter,\u201d Drake said. \n\tLeon typed away at the keyboard. \n\t\u201cWell, I just asked her to try and come in the door. Hopefully we\u2019ll get an answer soon, but you know how busy they are in R&D, it could be an hour before they manage to send someone up here,\u201d Leon said. \n\tSusanne sighed and went back to her desk. She pulled up her own monitor and continued her work. The job of the Experimental Requisitions Assistance Department couldn\u2019t stop, not even for a moment. Stuff like this was just par for the course here. \n\t\u201cDo you think our recent acquisition has anything to do with why the door just up and vanished?\u201d Susanne asked as she sipped from her coffee mug. \n\tThe three scientists looked out of the one-way window that adorned the wall on the far side of the room from the door. Through it, they could see a twisting, morphing object that their eyes couldn\u2019t quite focus on no matter how hard they tried. Doing so was liable to induce headaches, so they just avoided looking at it.\n\tDrake sat back down as well. \n\t\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t tell you what the heck that thing even is. But it's far from the most alien thing we\u2019ve gotten our hands on. It could certainly just have the unique property to get rid of means of ingress in a specific vicinity at irregular intervals. At least this\u2019ll make our job easier,\u201d he said. \n\tJessica shrugged, then went to take a sip of her coffee. The cup was empty.\n\t\u201cHey, Leon. Mind filling up my cup? We\u2019re gonna need the energy if we\u2019re gonna get through this report on time,\u201d she said.\n\t\u201cOh. The coffee machine is in the other room,\u201d he said.\n\tShortly after this statement, all three scientists were hammering at the wall where the door used to be, begging for release. Unfortunately for them, it took the security team an entire hour to cut through the unusually durable drywall. By that point, all the scientists were tragically decaffeinated.\n"}

The family was mostly quiet. Twenty-year-old Macy, the youngest of three granddaughters, periodically started to sob. The family lived by the code that feelings were bad and should be shoved down deep inside. Macy did not abide by this family tradition, and her sister, with a stiff arm, awkwardly patted her on the back.\n        Uncle Roy was curled up in the corner, snoring loudly, when Nanny Doe took her last breath. The family stood around the bed in silence, and watched a wailing         Macy throw herself across her grandmother\u2019s lifeless body. Another granddaughter, Sydney, proclaimed, \u201cAt least she\u2019s with Bud now.\u201d \n        Her mom pinched her arm, and Sydney hollered, \u201cOw!\u201d\n        Cassidy, the oldest granddaughter, gasped loudly and covered her mouth with her hand. \n        \u201cI didn\u2019t even hurt her,\u201d Sydney\u2019s mom hissed.\n        \u201cNot that! The cake! Where\u2019s the recipe for the cake?\u201d Cassidy shrieked.\n        Panic set in, and cries rang out. It was the most emotion the family had shown in years, if ever. Macy howled even louder. A disoriented Uncle Roy sat up and rubbed his eyes. \u201cTHE cake? What happened to the cake?\u201d he asked, joining the melee.\n        Nanny Doe was not particularly known for her culinary skills. The family referred to her chicken fried steak as \u201ckiller steak.\u201d It was so hard that it certainly could be classified as a deadly weapon. She admittedly hated cooking and joked that her dream house had no kitchen. However, she did have one recipe lauded by the family: Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake. The recipe was passed down from Nanny Doe\u2019s dear Aunt Flossie, rest her soul. Nanny Doe won many a blue ribbon when she entered in the county fair each year. \n        It was a decadent cake, light and fluffy with a richness that didn\u2019t cross the line of being too sweet. She used fresh pecans from the trees in her backyard. They had an almost buttery flesh that you couldn\u2019t get from the store bought ones. Nanny Doe was liberal with the vanilla, which perfectly accented the explosion of coconut flavor. Her cream cheese frosting was like silk and a treat in and of itself. The granddaughters always fought over who would get to lick the beaters.\n        Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake was requested for every birthday and holiday. Honestly, it was the only thing Nanny Doe could be trusted to make. Losing this recipe would be a devastating blow to the family. Christmas might as well be canceled because there would be nothing to celebrate. \n        Before the coroner even arrived to retrieve Nanny Doe, the children and grandchildren turned her kitchen upside down. They pulled every cookbook off the shelf. Food stained index cards were strewn across the kitchen in the chaos. They emptied cabinets and drawers, but to no avail. \n        The family slumped defeated on the brown and gold living room furniture. \u201cThis is the worst day ever,\u201d Cassidy declared. \u201cFirst, we lose Nanny Doe. Then the recipe. My entire childhood, gone in a flash.\u201d\n        Tears welled up in Macy\u2019s eyes, and she loudly blew her nose.\n        \u201cI doubt she even wrote it down,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cNanny Doe was punk rock. She hated rules.\u201d\n        The family nodded in agreement.\n        Dark times befell the family. Six birthdays and three holidays came and went without the cake. At every prayer before every meal, they asked Nanny Doe to guide them to the recipe. They reminisced about the good times eating the cake. Some unsuccessfully tried to channel Nanny Doe, hoping to recreate the magic. \n        On what would have been Nanny Doe\u2019s ninety-fourth birthday, the family gathered to watch home movies and eat second rate Italian cream cake from the grocery store. Seeing and hearing Nanny Doe was a bit startling. The usually stoic family became somewhat sentimental. They laughed at videos of Nanny Doe. She and Papaw Jack rode a tandem bicycle in one. Another showed her dancing the night away at Cassidy\u2019s wedding. Perhaps the most touching video was her with a wad of tobacco in her mouth, nodding off in her favorite recliner with Precious. \n        They loaded another cassette in the VCR. Nanny Doe and the granddaughters appeared on the screen, and the family sighed, \u201cAWWWW!\u201d  The girls were in the kitchen helping their grandmother cook. A little Macy, no more than three or four, sat on the counter. Sydney stuck her finger in the batter and Nanny Doe swatted her hand away. She handed ingredients to the girls and let them take turns putting them in the bowl.\n        \u201cNow, crack three eggs into the bowl. Very good! You can add more vanilla than that. One teaspoon isn\u2019t enough. Do four,\u201d Nanny Doe instructed.\n        The group fell silent in disbelief. Tears of joy began to fall, and they erupted in a roar of cheers. Cassidy and Macy jumped up and down, hugging each other. \n        \u201cShe told us! She finally told us!\u201d Macy screamed. \n        They watched the video of Nanny Doe making Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake five more times. They meticulously wrote down every ingredient and every step.         Each family member left that night with two handwritten copies of the recipe as well as an electronic copy. They were instructed to keep one in the kitchen and to put up the other with their birth certificates and other important documents. \n        Nanny Doe sent the most special birthday gift to her family. They swore it must be divine intervention, and they would thank their grandmother at every prayer.                 The cake would live on! That and the legacy of Nanny Doe.\n\n\n\nDate: 12.15.2023\nWord count: 1178\nClean Copy:\nNanny Doe had been talking to dead relatives going on three weeks.

Macy did not abide by this family tradition, and her sister, with a stiff arm, awkwardly patted her on the back.\nUncle Roy was curled up in the corner, snoring loudly, when Nanny Doe took her last breath. The family stood around the bed in silence, and watched a wailing Macy throw herself across her grandmother\u2019s lifeless body. Another granddaughter, Sydney, proclaimed, \u201cAt least she\u2019s with Bud now.\u201d \nHer mom pinched her arm, and Sydney hollered, \u201cOw!\u201d\n        Cassidy, the oldest granddaughter, gasped loudly and covered her mouth with her hand. \n        \u201cI didn\u2019t even hurt her,\u201d Sydney\u2019s mom hissed.\n        \u201cNot that! The cake! Where\u2019s the recipe for the cake?\u201d Cassidy shrieked.\n        Panic set in, and cries rang out. It was the most emotion the family had shown in years, if ever. Macy howled even louder. A disoriented Uncle Roy sat up and rubbed his eyes. \u201cTHE cake? What happened to the cake?\u201d he asked, joining the melee.\n        Nanny Doe was not particularly known for her culinary skills. The family referred to her chicken fried steak as \u201ckiller steak.\u201d It was so hard that it certainly could be classified as a deadly weapon. She admittedly hated cooking and joked that her dream house had no kitchen. However, she did have one recipe lauded by the family: Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake. The recipe was passed down from Nanny Doe\u2019s dear Aunt Flossie, rest her soul. Nanny Doe won many a blue ribbon when she entered in the county fair each year. \n        It was a decadent cake, light and fluffy with a richness that didn\u2019t cross the line of being too sweet. She used fresh pecans from the trees in her backyard. They had an almost buttery flesh that you couldn\u2019t get from the store bought ones. Nanny Doe was liberal with the vanilla, which perfectly accented the explosion of coconut flavor. Her cream cheese frosting was like silk and a treat in and of itself. The granddaughters always fought over who would get to lick the beaters.\n        Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake was requested for every birthday and holiday. Honestly, it was the only thing Nanny Doe could be trusted to make. Losing this recipe would be a devastating blow to the family. Christmas might as well be canceled because there would be nothing to celebrate. \n        Before the coroner even arrived to retrieve Nanny Doe, the children and grandchildren turned her kitchen upside down. They pulled every cookbook off the shelf. Food stained index cards were strewn across the kitchen in the chaos. They emptied cabinets and drawers, but to no avail. \n        The family slumped defeated on the brown and gold living room furniture. \u201cThis is the worst day ever,\u201d Cassidy declared. \u201cFirst, we lose Nanny Doe. Then the recipe. My entire childhood, gone in a flash.\u201d\n        Tears welled up in Macy\u2019s eyes, and she loudly blew her nose.\n        \u201cI doubt she even wrote it down,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cNanny Doe was punk rock. She hated rules.\u201d\n        The family nodded in agreement.\n        Dark times befell the family. Six birthdays and three holidays came and went without the cake. At every prayer before every meal, they asked Nanny Doe to guide them to the recipe. They reminisced about the good times eating the cake. Some unsuccessfully tried to channel Nanny Doe, hoping to recreate the magic. \n        On what would have been Nanny Doe\u2019s ninety-fourth birthday, the family gathered to watch home movies and eat second rate Italian cream cake from the grocery store. Seeing and hearing Nanny Doe was a bit startling. The usually stoic family became somewhat sentimental. They laughed at videos of Nanny Doe. She and Papaw Jack rode a tandem bicycle in one. Another showed her dancing the night away at Cassidy\u2019s wedding. Perhaps the most touching video was her with a wad of tobacco in her mouth, nodding off in her favorite recliner with Precious. \n        They loaded another cassette in the VCR. Nanny Doe and the granddaughters appeared on the screen, and the family sighed, \u201cAWWWW!\u201d  The girls were in the kitchen helping their grandmother cook. A little Macy, no more than three or four, sat on the counter. Sydney stuck her finger in the batter and Nanny Doe swatted her hand away. She handed ingredients to the girls and let them take turns putting them in the bowl.\n        \u201cNow, crack three eggs into the bowl. Very good! You can add more vanilla than that. One teaspoon isn\u2019t enough. Do four,\u201d Nanny Doe instructed.\n        The group fell silent in disbelief. Tears of joy began to fall, and they erupted in a roar of cheers. Cassidy and Macy jumped up and down, hugging each other. \n        \u201cShe told us! She finally told us!\u201d Macy screamed. \n        They watched the video of Nanny Doe making Aunt Flossie\u2019s Italian Cream Cake five more times. They meticulously wrote down every ingredient and every step. Each family member left that night with two handwritten copies of the recipe as well as an electronic copy. They were instructed to keep one in the kitchen and to put up the other with their birth certificates and other important documents. \n        Nanny Doe sent the most special birthday gift to her family. They swore it must be divine intervention, and they would thank their grandmother at every prayer. The cake would live on! That and the legacy of Nanny Doe.\n"}

Ringo carried a black briefcase, but otherwise the three looked nearly identical. They walked down the twenty-seven steps to the street, one hundred and fifty-six steps to their gray Toyota Corolla, and got in. George drove while John rode shotgun. Ringo, in the backseat, lit a cigarette and rolled down the window.\n        \u201cWe did it,\u201d John said, a thrill in his deep voice. \n        \u201cJust like Paul said,\u201d George nodded.\n        Ringo took a drag on his cigarette and pulled the briefcase beside him into his lap. Two clicks, and the top flipped up. Ringo\u2019s eyes grew wide, and his face shimmered from the glow emanating from within.\n        \u201cHow does it look?\u201d John asked.\n        \u201cIt looks perfect,\u201d Ringo said hoarsely as he slowly closed the case.\n        \u201cAlright,\u201d George said, exhaling loudly. \u201cFive minutes to the Precious Metals Museum. We go in and verify that the package has been received. Then we go to the drop point and get paid.\u201d\n        The three men parked in front of the museum, and got out of the car. Water still flowed down the gutter and into the drains. The mud had not yet washed away.\n        Pausing on the sidewalk, Ringo looked down at his shoes and shook the mud off. \n        George looked down and inspected his own shoes. \u201cThey had six inches of rain two days ago, and everything is still mud,\u201d he said with a grimace.\n        The three men walked up the fifty-four steps of the concrete staircase from the street to the main entrance. They marched single file into the museum, Ringo still carrying the briefcase. \n        A trio of security guards greeted the men. \u201cNo flash photography,\u201d said one. \n        The trio went through metal detection and passed their valuables through the x-ray machine. They continued through the Great Hall, past the Medieval Art Gallery, and took the stairs at the end of the Great Hall. They moved through the Egyptian Gallery and entered a suite of offices in the Rockefeller Wing. \n        A man wearing a three-piece suit and silk tie rose from behind a desk and put on a pair of sunglasses. \u201cEverything went as planned?\u201d Paul asked.\n        George, John, and Ringo nod. \u201cPackage received,\u201d they replied in unison. Paul studied them, then led the way.\n\n        At the base of the concrete staircase, on the sidewalk in front of the museum, the four men stood silently, looking at the empty spot where the car had been left.\n        \u201cWhere\u2019s the car?\u201d Paul asked. \n        \u201cWe left it right here,\u201d George said. \n        \u201cIt got stolen?\u201d John asked.\n        \u201cWhat kind of car?\u201d Paul asked.\n        \u201cToyota Corolla,\u201d said George.\n        \u201cWhat color?\u201d asked Paul.\n        \u201cGray,\u201d said Ringo.\n        \u201cMaybe kind of brown,\u201d said John.\n        \u201cWho are you, again?\u201d asked Paul.\n        \u201cJohn,\u201d said John.\n        At that moment, the four men watched a street cleaner pass on their side of the street. It is spraying water and sucking up debris left from the previous rainstorm. As it goes by, the main roller kicks up mud, and a water nozzle sprays back towards the sweeper to dislodge dirt as the side vacuum suckers everything up. After it passed by, the curb of the sidewalk was clean, and a long red stripe could be seen. \n        \u201cI didn\u2019t see that,\u201d George said.\n        \u201cWe didn\u2019t see that,\u201d Ringo said.\n        \u201cSo you still think somebody stole the car?\u201d Paul asked.\n        \u201cWe still have the briefcase,\u201d George said.\n        \u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Ringo said.\n        \u201cWho are you, again?\u201d Paul asked.\n        \u201cRingo!\u201d said Ringo.\n        Paul sighed, his gaze fixed on the empty spot. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring the thing inside.\u201d\n        Ringo opened the briefcase to show it was empty. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring it through security!\u201d\n        Paul pulled out his phone. \n        \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d asked Ringo.\n        \u201cNobody at the moment. I\u2019m getting us an Uber. One of you should find out what towing company picks up in front of the museum and where they take the cars.\u201d\n        John called the museum for information and got the number for the towing company. He calls them, nudging Ringo in the shoulder and making a writing motion.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your address?\u201d\n        A few minutes later, an SUV pulled up in front of the museum. Paul rode shotgun while George, Paul, and Ringo filed into the back seat. \n        \u201cFive-O-Six, West Fifteenth, yeah?\u201d the Uber driver said.\n        \u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Paul. \u201cDrive.\u201d\n        Less than ten minutes later, the Uber drove down an industrial street with high fences topped with barbed wire. The Uber stopped at a small building with aluminum siding. A heavyset man with a Metallica shirt stepped out.\n        John, Paul, George, and Ringo exited the Uber and approached Metallica Shirt.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re looking for our car,\u201d said Ringo. \u201cCame in within the hour.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat kind of car?\u201d asked Metallica Shirt. \n        \u201cToyota Corolla,\u201d said George.\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s the license number?\u201d\n        George, Paul, and John looked at Ringo. \n        \u201cHow should I know?\u201d asked Ringo.\n        \u201cWhat color was it?\u201d asked Metallica Shirt.\n        \u201cGray,\u201d answered John.\n        \u201cMaybe kind of brown,\u201d said George.\n        Metallica Shirt just stared at the men.\n        \u201cWe just rented the car,\u201d Paul said calmly. He took a hundred dollar bill from his wallet and handed it to Metallica Shirt. \u201cIf you can just take us to the car, we have the keys. We can pay you for the tow and drive it out of here.\u201d\n        \u201cWithout the license or any registration, I can\u2019t tell you where it's stored on the lot.\u201d Metallica Shirt took the money and slid it into his front pocket.\n        Paul smiled patiently. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. Just take us to the lot.\u201d\n        Metallica Shirt looked at them, then waved his hand for them to follow. They proceeded through the small building and filed past rows of parked pickups and SUVs. They followed Metallica Shirt for a couple of hundred yards and reached another metal fence topped with barbed wire before Paul asked, \u201cAre you sure it isn\u2019t in this lot here?\u201d        \n        Metallica Shirt shook his head, his greasy hair flipping about. \u201cNah, we keep the Toyota Corollas in their own yard.\u201d The man grunted and rolled the metal gate aside. For the first time, he smiled. \u201cWe get so many of them.\u201d\n        John, Paul, George, and Ringo stepped through the gate entrance. Their mouths slackened at the sight before them. Within the square mile of the fenced in lot sat hundreds of weather-beaten Corollas. Most were covered with dirt from the storm. They all looked the same\u2014dull gray or brown.\n        \u201cWhat\u2019d you say the color of your car was?\u201d"}
{"example_id":"example_067","inputs":"Write a story where something very important goes missing. The story should be between 1600-1700 words. The story should center around Marie, who is a freelance photographer from the United States and is traveling to Italy for the first time. She is excited to do something new for her career and get some beautiful shots and photos for her blog. She arrives in Italy and takes a taxi to her hotel in the mountains of Italy, above the town of Merano. The next day, Marie walks along the mountainside, taking photos of wildlife (chamois) and birch and fir trees, with the sun shining through. Marie makes it down the mountain to the town of Merano, snapping photos of the people and architecture. At the end of her day, she enjoys a meal of pizza and Italian soda. After three days and a wildlife tour, she leaves Italy. When Marie arrives at the airport in the United States, she finds out that the bag she had checked with her camera in it and all her photos of Italy has been lost. She is devastated.  ","targets":"        Marie listened to the gentle hum of the airplane, the white cotton-like clouds floating underneath the giant steel and titanium craft. Her pink neck pillow was no longer providing her comfort, so she took it off hastily and placed it in her bag underneath the seat in front of her. She secretly wished for the screaming baby behind her to be quiet, but she had a feeling that wasn\u2019t going to happen. There clearly wouldn\u2019t be any rest on the plane, so she banked on resting when she got to the hotel.\n        Marie had never been to Italy before, but she recently saved enough money to take a tour of the country and stay in an extravagant boutique hotel, tucked away in the mountains above Northern Italy. The hotel was fully equipped with infinity pools, a spa, and delicious regional cuisine. She had just started a blog about travel photography, making most of her money freelancing but hoping desperately to get picked up by some travel magazine or website. So far, she had only traveled in the United States to overly-visited destinations like Miami and Los Angeles. The thought of visiting some exotic and unfamiliar places was both inspiring and nerve-racking. She was determined to get beautiful naturalistic shots of the trees, mountains, and waterfalls that she would be surrounded by.\n        A voice came across the speaker. \u201cPlease fasten your seatbelts and secure any loose items\u2026\u201d with each passing word, more and more excitement grew inside Marie. Traveling was something she had always wanted to do, and she was now making a career out of it. Although she was alone and surrounded by strangers, a smile formed on her face, and she could feel her cheeks puffing up and turning red from joy. She imagined she looked like an elf, probably a bit silly, but she really didn\u2019t care.\n        The plane landed, and Marie quickly grabbed her carry-ons. One overhead, and one backpack on the floor. Her long, blue cardigan waved behind her as she headed out into the airport, going through the passport line, then making her way to the conveyor belt that held her final bag. As she finally stepped outside in the fresh Italian air, she didn\u2019t care that her dark brunette hair was in a strange half-ponytail, half-bun, with random flyaways hanging all over the place; she didn\u2019t care that her eyeliner now looked like she had been hungover for days without taking a shower or that her lips were dry and cracked from the small portions of water that were given to her on the plane. None of that mattered to her. She took a deep breath in through her nose, the air not smelling as fresh as she had hoped, but then exhaled happily. As tired as she was, her eyes glimmered with happiness.\n        \n        As the taxi scaled above the city of Merano, Marie took out her Nikon Z-9 and started scanning through her previous photos of beaches, palm trees, dolphins, and fire pits in the sand. They were beautiful, but she was excited to finally capture a different part of nature. With elation, she took a photo of her taxi driver - an olive-skinned Italian man with bushy eyebrows, an aquiline nose, and some scruff on his cheeks. He was pleasantly round and looked happy. He stumbled through his thick accent, but eventually said, \u201cExcited to be here, Miss?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Marie said as they pulled up to the front of the hotel. \n        The hotel was tall and lodge-like. It boasted a gorgeous Alpine mountain-chalet exterior, with potted plants lining a stone walkway. The taxi driver helped unload Marie\u2019s luggage, and she tipped him generously. A young bellhop came outside and began to load her bags onto a large cart. Finally, Marie inhaled and exhaled again, this time, taking in the robust essence of beech, silver fir, and Italian black pine. To Marie, it smelled like luscious freedom. She followed the bellhop into the hotel. The interior was just as beautiful as the exterior, with large, modern works of painted art hung on the walls, boasting shades of reds, greens, blues, silver, and gold. There was a cascading waterfall wall, surrounded by more potted flowers and small olive trees. \n        \u201cChecking in?\u201d the receptionist behind the desk asked. \n        \u201cYes. It\u2019s under Marie Mariner.\u201d\n        \u201cOkay, I have you in room 502. Here\u2019s your key, enjoy your stay.\u201d\n        Marie took the key and headed to the elevator, the bellhop following her with the large, heavy gold-plated cart. \n        She stepped into the room. It held a luscious king-sized bed, full of white, plush blankets and sheets; the windows were large, with sliding glass doors; and there was a porch with wicker furniture outside. The bathroom held a spacious oval-shaped tub, two sinks, and a separate shower, all equipped with thick, terry cotton towels. Marie tipped the bellhop, and he headed out. She ran out onto the porch, Nikon in hand, and began snapping photos of the scenery surrounding her. Gorgeous, robust trees, the town of Merano distantly below, and a small church sitting on a green hill off to her right. This is what dreams are truly made of, Marie thought.\n\n        After a restful night's sleep and a warm bath in the morning, Marie decided to venture out onto the mountainside. She packed her backpack full of snacks and water. She pulled her forest-green jacket on her back and grabbed her camera bag. Marie stepped out of the hotel lobby and looked left, then right, unsure of which direction to go. Either way held secrets, scenery, and adventure that she longed for, so to her, it didn\u2019t really matter. On impulse, she headed left and began walking down a large hill, the rocky path scraping against the bottom of her sneakers. She made her way into a shaded area and came across a chamois (an Italian mountain goat), its white face and deep brown body, eating grass amongst the trees. As she quieted her step, the chamois turned to look at her, tilting its head ever so slightly. Softly, she grabbed her camera from around her neck and snapped a photo. \n        \u201cGot it!\u201d she said, a little too loudly, scaring the chamois away.\n        Marie continued walking down the large mountain, taking her time, snapping photos of the sun beaming through crisp trees and melting snow on the ground. She chose not to rush; rushing would only make her feel like she was back home. This was something she wanted to savor and luxuriate in. \n\n        Finally, she made it down to the town of Merano. It smelled of warm tomatoes, pastries, and wine. It was bustling - but not in a loud, annoying way. Rather, it was exciting and whimsical. The town looked like it was straight out of a fairy tale. In the center stood a large chapel, its steeple soaring in between clouds and sunlight. The architecture of the homes and merchant\u2019s street looked medieval and timeless\u2014a beautiful collection of history and wonder. Marie wandered the streets, taking photos of vendors and shops - pizza shops, pastry shops, clothing boutiques and the exteriors of quaint apartments. As the daytime started to fade, she stopped for a slice of real Italian pizza - no matter what the signs in New York said, this was true Italian - and an Italian soda. After a day of beauty and culture, Marie trekked back up the mountain to her hotel. \n\n        At the end of three days, Marie\u2019s vacation had come to an end. She went on nature hikes and guided wildlife tours. She was sad to go, but felt an insurmountable happiness at the thought of arriving home and putting her new portfolio together. Marie said goodbye to the receptionist and loaded her luggage into a taxi. She boarded her plane back home, and this time she slept peacefully - no crying babies or kids kicking her seat. When she hopped off the plane, she went to the conveyor belt to grab her luggage. After waiting for ten minutes, she went to the customer service counter. \n        \"Hello, Ma'am, how may we help you?\u201d The woman behind the counter said, offensively cheerful. \n        \u201cYeah, my bag is not here. I know I checked it. It had a very expensive and important camera in there. Is there any way you can track it or tell me when it will arrive?\u201d\n        The woman behind the desk, now seemingly annoyed, made phone calls and typed on her computer heatedly, inserting Marie\u2019s ticket and customer number, the checked luggage number, and anything else she could find. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am. That bag seems to be lost,\u201d the woman said with a straight face and sharp tone, as though Marie had been the one to lose her own bag. \n        \u201cNo, no. You don\u2019t understand, my camera is in there. I just got back from Italy and took tons of photos and -\u201d\n        \u201cSorry, Ma\u2019am, there\u2019s nothing we can do right now. If you leave your information, we can give you a call when the bag is found.\u201d\n         Marie was feeling sick to her stomach now - tired, flushed, and like she was going to throw up her airplane food at any moment. \n        \u201cPlease, I really, really need that bag\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do right now, Ms. Mariner. Please step away, and we will call you when the bag is found.\u201d\n         Marie, now unsure if the trip even happened, stepped aside and took a seat on the nearest bench, the cold, dark metal chilling her shaking legs. As she sat in the middle of the airport, families happily greeting each other and bustling by - she placed her head in her hands and wept, tears falling through her fingers and to the ground. Her perfect trip was now over, and she had nothing to show for it."}

I\u2019ve been a staunch skeptic my whole life, and never believed that someone could truly see the future. At least, not accurately enough to start charging people for it. \n        My best friend, Joe, dragged me to visit one in the heart of Brooklyn after a long night of drinking, urging over and over that it\u2019d cure my heartache. What I  needed to be cured of was my hangover from the previous evening\u2019s wedding welcome party, but I obliged him anyway. He was the groom, and I was his best man. I felt the need to comply with every suggestion he had for his wedding weekend.                         However, I didn\u2019t know this would be in the plans.\n        \u201cThey\u2019re all charlatans, Joe. No one can predict the future,\u201d I insisted, following him closely through the bustling action of New York\u2019s lively streets.

She\u2019s like an all-seeing matchmaker.\u201d\n        \u201cCoincidence is convincing,\u201d I replied.

This\u2019ll give you some hope that someone way better than Selena is out there for you.\u201d \n        I didn\u2019t reply. My ex and I had broken up just a few weeks prior, and though I didn\u2019t want to admit it, a cloud of sadness hung over me everywhere I went. I\u2019d believed wholeheartedly that Selena was the one, but after two full years of dating, she abruptly confessed that she thought we should separate. \n        Attending a wedding, even the wedding of my best friend, wasn\u2019t a great distraction from my fresh heartache. Worse, Selena was in the bridal party, and I dreaded facing her again. Maybe Joe was right\u2014Perhaps I needed a distraction, even if it was something silly.\n        We turned down a narrow alley, the darkness slowly shrouding us as we turned a corner, then another. I was about to ask if we were lost when we stopped before a red door. The doorway was densely covered in a vast array of colorful neon hearts, glowing brightly in the darkness. Two red hearts flickered on and off on either side of the cursive neon that loomed large over the entrance, reading,                 \u201cMiss Everly.\u201d \n        Joe turned to me with an eager grin.\n        \u201cKeep an open mind,\u201d he reminded me, knocking three times on the door.\n        A woman opened the door, stepping into the rainbow glow of the alley. She dressed eccentrically, but I figured it came with the territory. Her hair was styled in a thick Afro, and she wore a long purple dress. The hearts hanging above her cast a neon halo around the margins of her hair. She greeted us with a serene expression. Her dazzling brown eyes greeted Joe with enthusiasm, and they met mine with an unexpected warmth. I couldn\u2019t fully place her expression; it made me think she knew something I didn\u2019t. \n        Joe put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cGreat to see you, Miss Everly. This is the friend I was talking about, Leo. He just got dumped.\u201d\n        I prepared to ameliorate this first impression when she motioned me into the room. \u201cCome on in, Leo! I\u2019m here to help,\u201d she announced. Joe raised an open hand in parting. \n        \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting outside. I can\u2019t wait to hear how it goes!\u201d\n        I watched him walk away as the door quickly swung shut. The door closed seemingly by itself as Miss Everly tapped me on the shoulder.\n        When I turned around, I felt a sudden peace upon meeting her calm gaze. She motioned to me with a contagious smile to sit in the red velvet chair across from hers. \n        The room was dimly lit, but reds of all shades and textures covering the interior were warmly illuminated by the glow of candlelight. Between the chairs sat a small table, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I saw a giant glass orb resting on top of it. \n        She shook her head with a grin. \u201cI love meeting skeptics.\u201d\n        I sat down, feeling suddenly sheepish. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, Miss Everly, I\u2019ve just never done this sort of thing.\u201d\n        \u201cI know. Call me Sibyl,\u201d she insisted, extending her hand over the crystal ball. When I grasped it, I felt an enticing warmth in her palm that made me cling on tighter. I inadvertently closed my eyes, and a sensation like summer wind blew gently through my chest.\n        \u201cYou were never going to end up with her,\u201d she mused. When I looked up at her, her eyes were fixed on mine. \u201cSome part of you knew that, huh?\u201d\n        I swallowed, taken aback by the observation. Joe shouldn\u2019t have brought me here. I wasn\u2019t just a skeptic. I realized at that moment that I didn\u2019t like discussing my personal life with a stranger. \n        \u201cYeah,\u201d I admitted, almost breathless. I took a slow, deep breath, doing my best to relax. \"I\u2019m trying to move past it, but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019m Joe\u2019s best man, and my ex is in the wedding. I\u2019m supposed to be excited, but it hurts all over again because think about how I wanted Joe to be the best man for Selena and me. Not that we ever talked about it, but-\"\n        \u201cShe fell into another love. It\u2019s a testament to your inner strength and your love for her to let her go.\u201d Sibyl crossed one leg over the other, cracking her fingers in a short cacophony of pops before reaching out to touch the crystal ball before her.\n        I stared at her, feeling my open mouth begin to dry. I closed it, blinking in disbelief.\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d\n        She looked equally confused. \n        \u201cThat\u2019s why you broke up. Right?\u201d\n        I shook my head slightly, my eyebrows knitting in disbelief. Selena had only said it wasn\u2019t working out and that we should see other people. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think so. Why do you say that?\u201d\n        She shrugged. \u201cI felt it on your hand.\u201d\n        I glared down at my open right palm as if it had betrayed me. Looking back at Sibyl\u2019s unbothered stare, I swallowed the knot of sadness growing in my throat. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched her in weeks.\u201d\n        Sybil chuckled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. But hey, if you don\u2019t want me to tell you the truth, which I\u2019m not sure if you do, you can leave anytime. You can tell your friend Joe that I predict you\u2019ll get with someone far better for you within the next two days.\u201d\n        As I opened my mouth to give a rebuttal, I hesitated at the seed of hope she\u2019d just planted in my chest. \u201cTwo days? Is that just something I\u2019m telling him, or do you mean that?\u201d\n        She raised her eyebrows. \u201cI was paid to shed some light on your romantic life. That\u2019s my forecast.\u201d\n        I leaned back in my seat, crossing my legs with a skeptical look. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d be heartbroken if you were wrong. I\u2019m very fragile right now.\u201d \n        \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d \n        The fortune teller reached out to grasp the crystal ball, running her hands gently along the surface while focusing intently on it. I thought I saw shades of red and pink pass through it, but I figured it was a trick of the light. \u201cI see a beautiful woman in a lovely red dress. She\u2019s got dark skin, a charming smile, and big brown eyes. You\u2019re staring into them, and you\u2019re laughing. Both of you are. There\u2019s been a change of heart, and you know it\u2019s what\u2019s brought you together. You feel like your problems have been solved. She\u2019s drawing you closer to her, and the both of you are kissing. Honestly, Leo, I can feel the love through this ball. You\u2019ll be over this heartbreak in no time.\u201d\n        In the midst of dreaming about meeting this mystery woman, wondering if she\u2019d be a guest at the wedding, I stopped. \n        \u201cSorry, wait \u2013 Selena fell in love with someone else?\u201d\n        Sibyl nodded. \u201cYour friend Burt. She couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\n        My jaw immediately dropped. \u201cBurt?\u201d I yelled without intending to, and I grabbed onto the armrests of the chair to ground myself. Burt was one of the groomsmen, and I\u2019d noticed some long looks and unwarranted laughter between them. I\u2019d convinced myself that I was just jealous and that I was imagining things.\n        \u201cCouldn\u2019t help it?\u201d I echoed. \u201cHow long has this been going on? She never mentioned anything to me!\u201d\n        Sibyl wore an earnest expression. \u201cCome on, Leo, she could never tell you about it. Don\u2019t you think if you were in her shoes, you\u2019d do the same thing?\u201d\n        No, I\u2019d never do that to her. I would\u2019ve been considerate. After all the wonderful times we\u2019d had together, I wasn\u2019t respected enough to be told the real reason we were splitting up. Not only that, but how could Burt do this to me? We weren\u2019t the best of friends, but I never thought he would double-cross me so brazenly. \n        My mind spun in its confusion, feeling suddenly desperate to call them out and ruin their fun. Especially as the best man, I\u2019d certainly dampen the wedding if I were to make some sort of scene \u2013 but         I also had the platform to illuminate their wrongdoing for everyone in attendance. I figured Joe could forgive me. After all, I would\u2019ve been none the wiser had he not brought me to see Sibyl. Could anyone really fault me for wanting to get revenge?\n        Though naturally, I couldn\u2019t reveal to anyone that I caught wind of their secret romance through a fortune teller. I\u2019d sound ridiculous. Suddenly, I felt so out of place. What was I doing?\n        I stood as anger and confusion filled my chest. I had to figure things out fast.\n        \u201cThank you, Sibyl, this has been very enlightening.\u201d\n        \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much,\u201d she replied. Just as I was about to ask for clarification as to what she meant, the door swung wide open. \n        Seeing me out, she walked with her arms akimbo. \u201cI\u2019ll mention that it\u2019s a mistake to bring this up to her, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to sway you.\u201d\n        \u201cI just have to go,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI\u2026 I have to figure this out. I really appreciate your help.\u201d\n        As I walked into the alley, I heard her say, \u201cSee you again soon.\u201d \n        I made a beeline down the alley to meet Joe. I found him sitting on a nearby bench. He stood as I approached.\n        \u201cHey buddy\u2026 How\u2019d it go?\u201d he softly inquired. I realized that my distress must be obvious. I shook my head in frustration. \n        \u201cSelena left me for Burt.\u201d\n        Now Joe was the one trying to convince me of the logical thinking that I\u2019d abandoned in my anguish. I\u2019d taken Sibyl\u2019s words as the hard truth, though I couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly why I felt inclined to do so, considering my lifetime of skepticism. It was something in her eyes and the way she spoke so matter-of-factly about my life, as well as the fact it was sadly conceivable. Looking back, I noticed a few moments of interaction between them that I\u2019d dismissed too quickly. \n        I explained everything to Joe in a breathless two minutes, and he clasped his hands together sympathetically.\n        \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Leo, that\u2019s really hard to hear. But one, she might be wrong! And two\u2026 Please don\u2019t ruin my wedding.\u201d\n        I quietly promised that I wouldn\u2019t, though I wasn\u2019t sure I could keep composed. I would try to wait until after the reception to say something, but I was nervous about how I\u2019d feel seeing them together.                 Maybe revenge could be taken in a less dramatic fashion such as telling her parents how she\u2019d wronged me in a group chat (her folks adored me), mentioning a few subtle (yet definitely embarrassing) details of their tryst in my best man speech, or simply ambushing them after the wedding to give them a piece of my mind. Soon the day came, and the need to get even clouded my mind. How would I embarrass them both without embarrassing Joe? Without embarrassing myself? I had to find a way.\n        I was consumed by shoddy plans, my ideas ranging from implausible to ridiculous. My mind kept spinning even up until the moments preceding the wedding ceremony. Finally, I caught a glimpse of them together. I assumed I would\u2019ve seen the two of them separately first, but as fate would have it, a laughing couple in the corner of the room caught my eye.\n        Rachel\u2019s bridesmaid dresses were bright pink and unflatteringly poofy, but Selena made the outfit look fashionable. She stood with a small amount of distance between her and Burt, and they appeared as if they were trying, if even only half-heartedly, to be discreet. It wasn\u2019t convincing enough. They stared at each other with an underlying attraction that would be obvious to any onlooker. Burt held his hands in his pockets while he spoke with her, and his gaze never left hers. She laughed openly and happily. They both did.\n        I\u2019d thought that seeing them would\u2019ve enraged me, that I would be incensed by the embarrassment of Selena moving on so quickly, but I was filled with an unexpected sense of peace. Sibyl\u2019s words echoed in my ears, \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to your inner strength and your love for her to let her go.\u201d \n        She\u2019d been quick to point out that Selena could never have told me about their budding attraction.                 For the first time, I realized Sibyl was right; I couldn\u2019t really blame her. Sure, she could\u2019ve been honest, but with such proximity to the wedding, maybe she didn\u2019t feel it\u2019d be wise to mention Burt upon.\n        I stepped away, making sure to keep a distance from them and focusing instead on imagining the woman I\u2019d allegedly be moving on with. I hoped Sibyl was right.\n        Joe and Rachel read their vows, and kissed to the sounds of applause echoing through the spacious church. The congregation slowly made their way to the nearby reception hall. All the while, I kept an eye out for a brown-eyed, dark-skinned woman in a red dress. As the night progressed, I continued to search while avoiding Burt and Selena, but to no avail. No one at the event matched the description, and I left the reception with far less hope than I\u2019d arrived with.\n        It was the following afternoon, over a goodbye lunch with Joe and the groomsmen, when it suddenly hit me. I laughed out loud to myself.\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Joe asked me, taking a bite of his sandwich. I laughed again, unable to hide my joy. My realization seemed so obvious \u2013 if I was right.\n        \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d I answered. \u201cI realized that I might have a date tonight.\u201d\n        That evening, I headed back through Brooklyn\u2019s busy streets at dusk, the sky covered in heavy clouds. A soft rain began to fall as I arrived back at Miss Everly\u2019s colorful doorstep. \n        Right when I reached up to knock on the door, it suddenly opened.\n        Walking out from the candlelight\u2019s glow was Miss Everly, donning a lovely red dress and beaming widely at me.\n        I intended to say something suave, to ensure I wasn\u2019t just being presumptuous, but found myself rendered speechless. I was stunned by everything that had transpired, and became lost in the warmth of her eyes. \n        The rain turned into a downpour as we stood, giggling like kids underneath it.\n        \u201cCome on, we\u2019re gonna catch a cold,\u201d Sibyl teased, taking my hand once again and drawing me into the room. As we slowly embraced, the door closed of its own accord behind me.\n"}

The restoration project had been going on for over a century, but the clear-cut logging of the twentieth century and climate change into the twenty-first made the entire region vulnerable enough that only ecologists and conservation personnel were allowed in. And I was neither.\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s boring,\u201d he argued. \n\t\u201cWhat, just because the beaches aren\u2019t white sand? Or because there isn\u2019t extensive gambling? I\u2019ve told you before, gambling really isn\u2019t my thing.\u201d\n\tHe sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s also more expensive right now than the other packages. I know, I know, you have the budget for it, but there hasn\u2019t been much development precisely because the redwoods took off there. There\u2019s only four major cities, and at the last count, twenty minor cities across the entire planet.\u201d\n\t\u201cHonestly, Miguel? That\u2019s why I want to go. I need a break from the urban sprawl here on Earth. And what isn\u2019t packed cityscape is either designated as a vacation destination, or you  have to be specifically assigned to it. At least on Sequoia, I have a chance to wander through the redwood forests.\u201d \n\tIn typical fashion, as soon as redwoods ended up dominating the terraforming process, some marketing hack decided to name the planet after the genus of the tree, presumably anticipating yet another tourist destination. However, the Ruling Council of Colonies strictly limited development and tourism on Sequoia for the first hundred years, and that restriction had only been lifted a year ago. \n\tMiguel nodded, conceding the point. \u201cThe government of Sequoia did set up some preserves specifically for tourists. Did you have any particular one in mind?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, but I trust you to pick one, given the parameters I set.\u201d\n\t\u201cOkay, Willow,\u201d Miguel sighed, \u201cI\u2019ll pull something together, and by next week you should be on a different planet for your vacation.\u201d\n\tI grinned at him, shook his hand, and left the agency to head back to my apartment. After ten years of working with only on-planet vacations, I figured I\u2019d earned the right to treat myself. And from the catalog of immersive sensory experience recordings, or ISERs, the redwoods of Sequoia seemed to be what I most wanted.\n\tMy shuttle touched down at the Mendocino Spaceport on Sequoia five days after I\u2019d asked Miguel to schedule the trip. He\u2019d given me my itinerary the next morning, I\u2019d boarded the shuttle up from Earth that evening, and it took three days for the jumpship to get me to Sequoia. The only other passengers were xenobotanists who wanted to study the development of the redwoods on Sequoia, so I spent most of the trip replaying my favorite ISER, \u201cMuir Woods Trail at Dawn.\u201d\n\tThe shuttle pilot informed us it was late afternoon, Sequoia time, with light breezes and minimal cloud cover at the moment, and that our local contacts would be waiting for us inside the spaceport terminal. The xenobotanists, all aflutter, made a dash for the exit, while I took a couple of deep breaths. Sequoia wasn\u2019t going anywhere in the few minutes it would take them to disembark, and for some reason, I found myself a bit nervous. Probably because this was my first time ever off-Earth.\n\tBut I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see the redwoods if I didn\u2019t get off the shuttle, so I took a deep breath, claimed my carry-on luggage, and made my way to the exit tunnel. Even though the atmosphere was nearly Earth-identical, once I exited the airlock, it just seemed fresher. \n\tArden, my guide, agreed. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got regulations on Earth for pollution, and the governments have all put effort into cleaning up their messes, but I noticed a difference the one time I went to see the original redwoods.\u201d They brushed a hand through their lavender hair and laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s a fraction of a percent more oxygen in the air, but personally, I think it\u2019s just that most of the surface is covered in forests.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhere do I get to stay tonight? My travel agent has a list of things I can do, but there\u2019s no real itinerary, which I\u2019m honestly fine with.\u201d\n\t\u201cMx. Davis, I\u2019m your host for the trip,\u201d Arden smiled. \u201cSure, the government has nature preserves specifically for people like yourself, but there really isn\u2019t infrastructure for a burgeoning tourist trade yet. So the government reviews the profiles of people who\u2019re coming to the planet, then they ask a pool of residents for someone to volunteer to host visitors. I took a look at your profile, and suspected we might get along.\u201d\n\tCuriously, as we walked through the fairly small terminal to their hovercraft, I asked, \u201cWhat made you suspect that?\u201d\n\t\u201cWe both have a tendency to be more comfortable with smaller numbers of people, what they used to call introverts back in the early twenty-first century and we have similar dietary needs. And though you\u2019ve never actually experienced them, you seem to love the redwoods as much as I do. I get reimbursed for my time and whatever supplies I need to provide, so this is a bit of a mini-vacation for me, too.\u201d\n\tOnce inside their hovercraft, they suggested a range of restaurants they liked, and we ended up chatting for a couple of hours over dinner at a seafood place that I fell in love with. They told me stories of living on Sequoia, interspersed with suggestions for locations I might want to visit and places to avoid. In exchange, I told them about my job and my life back on Earth \u2013 the kind of things two people might discuss when getting to know each other.\n\tAnd in the morning, I woke up to a thick blanket of fog outside the window of my guest bedroom. I\u2019m not sure how long I spent in the double bed, staring out the window in wonder. Even after over a hundred years of work on the environment, naturally occurring fog was a rarity on Earth.\n\tArden finally gently knocked on the door frame, announcing with an amused tone in their voice, \u201cHey Willow, breakfast is ready. And if you think this is amazing, just wait until I get you into the redwoods proper.\u201d Grinning, I nodded. \n\tOnce we\u2019d had breakfast, Arden asked me whether I was interested in just being around the trees or hiking. \n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I asked curiously.\n\t\u201cWell, there\u2019s a fantastic picnic area, if you just want to sit and enjoy the ambiance. It\u2019s one of my favorite spots when I\u2019m not up for hiking. On the other hand, that picnic area does function as the start and end point of a very accessible hiking trail, and the tourism board has a bunch of mobility assistance devices available for people who want to use the trail but aren\u2019t able to walk it.\u201d\n\tI considered my options. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get overwhelmed, so maybe let\u2019s start at the picnic area, and then I can see what I want from there?\u201d\n\tArden nodded. \u201cThat sounds like a plan. We\u2019ll pick up food and supplies on the way, and not to worry. The fog around here clears for a few hours in the afternoon, but that\u2019s about it. Something about the terraforming process, the terrain, and the proximity to the ocean guarantees it. That\u2019s probably why the redwoods expanded here so well.\u201d\n\tBy the time we got to the picnic area, the fog had lightened a bit, but not dissipated. There were a few people already there, but one of them headed off to the hiking trail right after we started setting up, and the other two eventually headed back to their hovercraft and left. \n\tI\u2019m not sure how long I spent in that grove, experiencing sensations that were somehow more real than any ISER I\u2019d tried. The cool, damp air against my skin tingled; logically I knew it was just tiny droplets of water suspended in air, but being there added all of my lived experience to the mix. The fog drifted slowly through the trees, swirling around the trunks and hiding, then revealing the upper reaches where thicker branches had developed. I noticed a smell that mixed moist earth, a mild spiciness, and faint sweetness. And when Arden said I could touch the trunks, I spent probably a silly amount of time just touching the surfaces of the trees, feeling the rough, almost cloth-like texture of the bark.\n\tArden was sitting at one of the tables when I\u2019d finally had my fill for the moment. They\u2019d set up a tablet, along with our picnic in stasis boxes, and gave me a happy little grin when I turned back to them. \n\t\u201cYeah, I do that about once a month. Just come here and get lost in the sensations. Even though I live here, it\u2019s surprisingly refreshing.\u201d\n\tI nodded, not yet ready to speak. It was everything that I\u2019d wanted from my vacation, and I\u2019d barely spent half a day awake here. \n\t\u201cI\u2019d recommend you have a snack now,\u201d they said kindly, \u201csince this isn\u2019t an environment you\u2019re used to, and the gravity is a bit stronger than Earth\u2019s. You\u2019ve got, what, three weeks here?\u201d At my nod, they continued, \u201cSo you\u2019ve got some time for exploring what you want. I\u2019ll recommend that you get some direct, lived experiences around here for the first couple of weeks. We\u2019ve got some ISER equipment available too, high-end quality stuff, headsets you won\u2019t even notice after a couple of minutes, and you\u2019ll probably want to record your favorite experiences for later. But save that for your last week, I think?\u201d\n\tI sat down across from them, gently running my fingertips across the table that was clearly made from the local redwood, feeling the polished grain that was so different from the rough bark, and sighed. \u201cPart of me wants to move here, but I\u2019m pretty sure my job won\u2019t agree to a nearly fifty light-year lag in my work.\u201d\n\tArden smiled. \u201cWe have plenty of opportunities here.

Sunlight breaks in, creating different hues of vibrant blue. The water is so warm, it is almost like taking a relaxing bath. I have waited years to snorkel in the Mediterranean Sea. It doesn\u2019t disappoint, sometimes dreams do come true. \n        I\u2019ve loved the water ever since I can remember. In fact, I don\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t know how to swim. Growing up, we had a boat that we would take to the beach on weekends. I loved those trips. Being around water is associated with my favorite childhood memories, and I think that is why I love it so much. Even though I always wore a life jacket when on the boat, my father thought it important that I knew how to swim. I became very good at swimming.\n        I\u2019ve gone swimming in the ocean many times. However, the Atlantic Ocean is opaque and cold. Also, there are sharks. I\u2019m one of those unfortunate people who saw the famous shark movie and now when I swim I hear that music.  Even in the pool, for some reason, to be precise in the deep end of the pool, I expect to see the shark waiting for me. In spite of this fear, I really love the water. \n        However, for a day of snorkeling, the dream is to be in the Mediterranean Sea where there are no sharks.  For some reason, I fear the shark in the pool, but here in the sea there is no fear. Perhaps the water has washed some of my reason away.\n        I\u2019m so far away from the sailboat that brought us out to snorkel. I\u2019m not worried about it. I mean, I can see land, if I end up being one of those people left behind, I can make a swim for it. Since a shark won\u2019t be following me, I can take my time if it comes to that. I love the freedom of the water, of moving through it. The sound of the water sloshing in my ears as I swim is so relaxing. \n        I know I should be thinking only happy thoughts whilst exploring the sea, but I keep thinking of Kate Chopin\u2019s book The Awakening. At the end, the heroine swims out to sea as her last act. At this moment, I can truly empathize with water being the place for that choice. It is so peaceful in the water. Surrounded by the beautiful blue, one can be alone with one\u2019s thoughts. \n        I\u2019m surprised by the clarity of the water. After swimming in the Atlantic Ocean where it is hard to see anything, here you can see everything.  Where we are exploring, the bottom is about twenty-five feet deep, and you can see the patterns in the sand.  There are not many fish in this area, which is just as well for me.  With my luck, one would bite me. Plus, we are having grilled fish for lunch back on the boat, so I think it is better without any encounters. \n        I just realized that I\u2019m not moving. I\u2019m not sure at what point I just started floating a bit and staring at the sand below me. I don\u2019t ever remember feeling this relaxed. It is nice to just literally float and be moved about by the gentle waves. I wish this moment could last forever. \n        Clang! Clang! Ugh! It is the bell from the boat calling us to return for lunch and the ride back to the port. I take a deep breath and make my way toward the boat. My snorkeling time is sadly over. However, I\u2019ll always remember my time exploring the sea. It is amazing to find a place where one can truly relax and just be alone with one's thoughts. "}

They had been sailing up the coast for days, stopping at various points along the way to resupply their ships and trade with locals who seemed nervous but friendly. The locals spoke of a great civilization that ruled their land with an iron fist. They called these people the Mexica. The group had also run into an emissary from the capital of the Mexica civilization. This emissary had been sent out with gifts and a message, welcoming the new visitors to come and see the splendor of Tenochtitlan for themselves as the special guests of Emperor Moctezuma II. \n        Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was a crafty leader. He held his cards close to the chest. He wanted to find out more about this civilization before traipsing right into the capital. So he told the emissary to accept the Emperor\u2019s warm welcome and inform them that they would be in the city within a few months. After all, with a crew of six hundred men, several dozen horses, and a cavalcade of pigs, sheep, goats, and dogs, the journey inland would take some time and effort. All the while, Cort\u00e9s planned on building alliances with local Native peoples who mostly belonged to a different ethnic group known as the Tlaxcalans. \n        The Tlaxcalans called the Mexica the Aztecs and they were not happy with the ways that the Aztecs not only taxed their people but also took their citizens by force for the purposes of human sacrifice. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s hoped that, should the relationship between his soldiers and the Mexica go south while in the capital, he could count on these Tlaxcalans for support. A Tlaxcala man named Patox, who knew the Mexica language, volunteered to accompany the Spanish on their journey to the capital.\n        Don Rodrigo arrived with the conquistadors to the city of Tenochtitlan, built upon Lake Texcoco, on November 8, 1519. The night before, Patox the interpreter explained the city\u2019s fantastical location as they sat eating one of the Spanish pigs they had brought from their ships by the campfire. Patox explained that the Mexica had come to this region hundreds of years ago. They had journeyed for an eternity searching for a place to call home until they spotted an eagle, a powerful symbol of strength in their religion, resting on a cactus, a serpent clutched firmly in his beak. They knew then that they had found their home. But this home was on a small island in the center of a swampy lake. The Mexica people worked in knee-deep mud, lashing together reeds and wooden stakes to build out the little island until finally they had constructed nearly 2,500 acres of land upon which to build their city. They left behind a network of canals, much like Venice, and a triumph of human engineering.  \n        For the conquistadors, the first sign of Tenochtitlan came in the form of the vast causeways that connected the islands of the city to the mainland. The conquistadors slowly maneuvered across one of these causeways, moving through the crowds of people that went about their business on a cool autumn morning. A large portion of the crowd stepped away from the Spaniards marching past, whispering in clusters about the strangely dressed white men in shiny suits of stone.\n        The conquistadors stared back at the diverse crowd. The Mexica varied greatly in their clothing. Some of the men and women wore very little, with the men wearing not much more than loin clothes and a simple mantle around their shoulders and the women wearing a cotton skirt in neutral colors and a short-waisted, sleeveless blouse with intricately beaded patterns around the neckline. Other individuals were dressed in similar garb, but their clothing was adorned with precious gemstones and affixed with exotic parrot plumage. \n        Don Rodrigo was also in awe at the sight of the sheer number of people moving across the causeway. He had seen the largest cities of Spain at the height of major festivals but had never seen so many people concentrated in one space. The colors and smells of the market stalls that lined the bridge overwhelmed his senses,and he felt as if he had stepped into some sort of fever dream.\n        On his right, a fruit and vegetable vendor was yelling in Nahuatl about his various wares. Don Rodrigo glanced to see a variety of fauna in colors that would put a painter\u2019s palette to shame. Maize in hues of purple, blue, yellow, and orange piled high in a woven basket was placed next to carefully stacked squash. The squash resembled those brought back to the King and Queen from earlier Spanish voyages, but were green and oddly-shaped. Alongside the squash sat a pile of yellow flowers the color of goldenrod, carefully tied into bundles for sale.  Dried peppers of a variety of reds, yellows, and greens hung from the stall rafters and rustled with each breeze. Don Rodrigo saw a pile of beautiful, ruby-red apples and grabbed one, only to have it burst in his hand in a wet, pulpy mess. The stall-owner furrowed his brow and crossed his arms, but said nothing to the strangers as they passed by. Patox would later explain to Don Rodrigo that these were not apples but rather tomatoes. \n        As Don Rodrigo got closer to the causeway entrance, a smell wafted through the air that took him back to his childhood visits to the panaderia near his grandfather\u2019s villa in Toledo. He looked over and saw a line of large black circular rocks. The rocks were balanced over wood burning fires and manned by various Mexica people, predominantly older women. The women each had a large bowl next to their feet on the ground that contained an enormous ball of yellow dough. They took the dough in their brown, wet hands and patted it into a circular shape before slapping it with a satisfying sizzle onto the black rock. Don Rodrigo watched them as they flipped the circular flat dough before offering it up to anxiously waiting customers. \n        Though Don Rodrigo\u2019s stomach growled, he saw Cort\u00e9s motion to his distracted men up ahead to continue further into the city. He followed suit and reached the end of the causeway. The visual that then assaulted his eyes would be one that he would carry with him all the days of his life. \n        A teeming metropolis sprawled across the vast island civilization in whitewashed adobe buildings, market stalls, and wooden homes. The nobility built more elaborate multi story homes decorated with murals embedded with colorful stones. Though the city had been built on an island, the planners were careful to give ample space to the layout of the streets. In addition, there were numerous street cleaners with brooms made of reeds and palm leaves busy at work maintaining the city\u2019s beautiful aesthetic far beyond any European capital he had ever seen. Don Rodrigo looked ahead and saw a vast double-temple complex standing between eighty and ninety feet tall and rising up out of the heart of the city. \n\tHe caught up to Patox and asked if that was the Emperor\u2019s Palace. Patox said no but that it was even more important than the palace. It was the Templo Mayor, dedicated to Huitzilopochitli, the god of war, and Tlaloc, the god of rain. It loomed large over the city, and even from this distance Don Rodrigo could see various priests bounding up and down the blue and red painted steps. Turquoise stones formed geometric patterns across various platforms on the terraced pyramids and drums echoed out of the structures, filling the streets with a reverberating sound at all times as if it were the heartbeat of a living, breathing city.\n        As the conquistadors crossed various canals on their way to the palace, they noticed the beautiful chinampas that dotted the city waterways. These floating gardens housed a variety of flowers sacred to the Mexica. Don Rodrigo did not know their names but would later come to know them as dahlias, and poinsettias, respectively. The chinampas, however, were just as practical as they were beautiful. The Mexica people predominantly used them as a form of small scale farming. Tying together reeds and vines, they would layer topsoil and decaying organic materials, creating a floating mini-island for growing maize, squash, and beans. Some of the islands were even large enough to contain small orchards of fruit trees.\n        Don Rodrigo was enthralled by the splendor of this place, but he also was delighted by the hustle and bustle of the people within it. They brought a color to the city that he could never have envisioned in any European nation. First, the city itself held many tens of thousands of people, far more than even the largest European cities that Don Rodrigo had visited in his lifetime. Second, because the wheel had not yet been invented in this land and because there were no horses or other burden-bearing beasts, the only way to transport goods and services was through human beings physically carrying materials. The position of porter was one of the most commonly held jobs in the city, or so it would seem. \n        Everywhere Don Rodrigo looked, a porter carried a variety of items on his back or in his arms. A large man wearing very little clothing and sporting a metal bar through his nose carried a heavy basket filled to the brim with black obsidian stones. Another one nearly knocked Don Rodrigo down as she dragged a sag bursting at the seams with what looked like strips of dyed cotton fabric. Don Rodrigo backed, visually overwhelmed. Suddenly, he smelled a strong scent of animal musk and heard a deep growl. He turned to come face to face with a large black cat with yellow eyes sitting in a small cage. A woman yelled at him in Nahuatl, and Patox grabbed Don Rodrigo by the arm, telling him this large creature was called a jaguar.\n        Don Rodrigo got back into the line of conquistadors marching down the main street of the city towards the emperor\u2019s palace. He thought about the glory he would bring home to Spain for taking part in this illustrious expedition. He remembered that his ultimate goal was to win souls for God and the one true church. And of course, he looked forward to the gold that Cort\u00e9s had promised all the men once they had subjugated these ingenuitive people. \n        The group passed by a smaller temple building where a Mexica woman appeared to be arguing with a priest. Don Rodrigo noticed that she held a small boy in her arms. He couldn\u2019t have been more than four years of age. His face and arms were covered with red, distinctive sores. Don Rodrigo knew these sores from his own childhood, smallpox, but he looked away and marched onwards.\n"}

I\u2019ll get you back to the beach and sunshine by the time the little critter can crawl.\u201d\n        I had been trying to hold it together, but the reality of my new situation was finally hitting me.\n        John and I had met in the charming California beach town, Montecito. I had been a sun kissed dreamer, bar tending. He was a delightfully nerdy journalist who had a fresh out of grad school vibe. He swept me off my feet with poetry and long walks on the beach. He was handsome, kind, and so cheerful that it was almost unbearable. I was adventurous, flirty, and edgy. He liked my grit. I liked his optimism.         We fell in love so hard and so fast that we hardly had time to catch our breath before I found out that I was already a month pregnant the exact same day that John got laid off from his cushy remote job.\n        When John\u2019s old colleague offered him a visiting professor position for the spring term at the University of Chicago\u2019s Journalism, Arts, and Media school, we felt as though we\u2019d been handed a lifeline. He had a family friend who offered to let us stay for a few months in her late mother\u2019s house in the suburban town of Villa Park, Illinois. It was free housing, driving distance from the campus. John was psyched. I was relieved.\n        I tried to harness John\u2019s cheerfulness while I packed my few belongings. I put all of my best bikinis in a cardboard box and dropped them off at my friend Cherry\u2019s place.\n        \u201cThe Midwest? Really?\u201d Cherry had asked me.\n        \u201cIt\u2019ll be the chance to explore somewhere I have never been before,\u201d I said.\n        Our road trip was romantic. We talked about baby names and nursery colors. I was driving across the country to start a family with the man I loved. But now, looking at the grim reality of my new residence, I felt a pang of panic.\n        The house was sterile and airless. We opened all the windows, but the shockingly cold January air forced us to shut everything up again.\n        The next morning, John said, \u201cYou should explore a bit while I go to campus.\u201d\n        I dropped him off by the train station. Several other people were waiting by the tracks, all wearing long, black, puffy coats. There was a liquor store and an empty lot full of gravel. John kissed me goodbye.\n        I spent the day driving around and taking in my new surroundings. I passed hair salons and grocery stores. At a mini-mall, I found a discount clothing store and I bought myself a new coat that fit around my growing body. I picked up some groceries from a giant chain store and was surprised to find a whole shelf filled with different brands of pickled vegetables called giardiniera. After stopping at a hot dog stand for lunch, I went back to the drab ranch house.\n        When John got home that afternoon, he found me curled up on the dusty front room couch. He took one look at my face and said, \u201cI know what is wrong! Ennui! You\u2019ve been struck with ennui.\u201d \n        \u201cWhat\u2019s ennui?\u201d\n        \u201cListlessness. A lack of excitement. The plight of suburban existence!\u201d\n        \u201cLook, I get that you\u2019re trying to cheer me up, but I\u2019m not in the mood to wax poetic with you right now, John.\u201d\n        \u201cI know what we need,\u201d he said. \u201cAwe. We both need a healthy dose of awe.\u201d\n        John coaxed me into my new puffy coat and back in the car. We slowly crept through traffic on a highway and drove forty minutes into the city. John sang along to songs on the radio and kept throwing me meaningful glances. I knew he wanted me to sing with him as I usually did, but I sat in the passenger seat, quiet and sullen.\n        As we drove through the city, I looked up at the tall, looming buildings. The architecture looked stark against the gray sky. Then I saw a strip of blue against the gray as we pulled up next to Lake Michigan. It was the first time I had seen a huge body of open water since leaving California. I rolled my window down, and got a face full of bitingly cold air. It did not smell like the ocean, but it did look like an ocean. The water stretched out as far as I could see.\n        John turned to the south, and then we pulled up next to a large stone building next to the lake. It was an antique looking structure with a huge domed roof.\n        \u201cThis is the Adler Planetarium,\u201d John told me. He explained that this was the first planetarium in the country that was opened to the public. He had been here once before as a child and had never forgotten it. He took my hand and walked me in.\n        I had never been to a planetarium, and the building was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Giant models of planets hung from the ceiling. Huge windows opened up to the lake, which glowed a dim purple in the dusk. John led me to an auditorium with a massive dome screen. We took our seats as the music started up. We lay back, looking up at the screen that surrounded us.\n        As the gigantic rounded screen sprung to life, I saw an image of Chicago, filmed from above. Then the image zoomed out, drawing me further and further up, through clouds and then into the atmosphere.        Soon I was outside the earth, looking at the blue and green planet from a great distance. Moments later, as the music soared, I was zooming away into the blankness of expanding space.\n        I felt, for the first time, a slight fluttering movement within me.\n        Suddenly, I was not in Chicago. I was not a displaced melancholic afloat in the murky sea of ennui. No. I was a speck of dust floating in the endless cosmic waves. I was the tiniest dot of consciousness in the inconceivable vastness of space. I was alert and alive. I was in love and had a new life growing inside of me. I squeezed John\u2019s hand.

Standing in the doorway was a figure bundled up under several layers of cloth. Flurries of snowflakes fluttered around him, landing on the cold ground of the stone hall. The figure staggered into the hall now filled with the moans of the mountain wind. Grabbing the side of the doors, the figure shoved on them with all his might. Slowly, the doors once more swung closed, and the figure was sealed in darkness. \n        At least until a lantern sprung to life in the hands of the covered figure. Said figure quickly set the lantern down to free up their hands. The figure peeled off the layers of thermal wear to reveal an old man with an enormous mustache. His hair was gray with age, not with the storming white outside. With a grunt, he unslung the enormous pack from his back, leaving it to slam on the floor. He winced at the cacophonous reverberation, but quickly dug into the pack. \n        With a sigh of relief, he pulled out a dark jar from the depths of the pack. After tapping the lid and waiting a moment, he popped the top off. A tiny chandelier hung down from the underside of the lid, which the old man daintily handled as he set it to the side and peered into the jar.\n        Inside was a modestly decorated inn room in miniature. A tiny bed sat in one corner, while a window that showed the night\u2019s sky looking out over a small town was perched on one wall. A bookshelf adorned another wall, and a chair rested in front of a crackling fireplace. The flame gave off no smoke. Sitting in the chair with a book in his lap was a small fairy with electric blue skin and a shock of white hair on his head. \n        \u201cWe there boss?\u201d He asked up at the huge face of the old man. \n        \u201cYes.

Stop your apologizing. It\u2019s unbecoming. Now, let me grab the journal, and we can get started,\u201d the fairy said.\n        With a zip of blue light, the fairy darted back down into his jar. He put his book back on the bookshelf, then used the complex metal contraption that ran across the front of each shelf to firmly secure the book in place. With the faintest clinking sound, he unlatched another book and shot out of the jar to hover over the old man\u2019s shoulder. \n        The old man grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about you in that jar buried in the pack.

All of which I believe I told you before we set out.\u201d\n        In a flash of blue light, Selyn was above Thorin\u2019s shoulder with the journal open and his pen rapidly darting over the pages. \n        \u201cNow, now Thorin. I\u2019m only teasing you. I take your notes, of course I\u2019d retain some of what I write down,\u201d Selyn said.\n        Thorin crossed his arms. \u201cProve it.\u201d\n        With a long-suffering sigh, Selyn rattled off a series of facts, marking each one with an extended finger.\n        \u201cThis temple was the main place of pilgrimage for the adherents of elemental power. Every decade, they\u2019d send a host of people out here to rekindle their people\u2019s connection with the primal elements or something. Very odd they\u2019d use the word \u2018rekindle\u2019 when they supposedly were communing with ALL the elements and not just fire,\u201d Selyn said. \n        Thorin nodded. \u201cVery good. Nice to see your scatterbrain can retain some information. I\u2019m hoping we find the answer behind that odd wording here. That said, I don\u2019t expect it to be easy.\u201d \n        \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t easy to get here, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Selyn said. \n        \u201cOh. I was less referring to the trek to get here, and more referring to that,\u201d Thorin said. \n        As he did, he walked deeper into the temple and raised his lantern. It illuminated an enormous door covered with intricate engravings. They were split into four quadrants, each depicting a major element. Fire peeled away the darkness on one corner, water nurtured life in another, earth laid the foundations for the world in a third, and air filled the sails of boats and turned windmills in the final section. \n        Selyn blinked up at the door, which must have seemed truly titanic to his miniscule frame. \n        \u201cYes, I can see how that would be intimidating, but hear me out,\u201d he said. \n        In a blink of light, Selyn was in front of the door and pushing at it. Naturally, it didn\u2019t budge. Another blink and he was back next to Thorin.\n        \u201cOkay. Brute force is clearly not the solution here. I doubt an ogre could get that thing open,\u201d Selyn said.\n        Thorin set his lantern down and went back to his pack. \n        \u201cUnfortunately, we won\u2019t be able to test that theory, as we lack an Ogre within easy reach. We should try using our heads instead of our muscles,\u201d Thorin said. \n        He pulled three jars from the pack and walked towards the massive door. \n        \u201cSelyn, if it isn\u2019t too much of a bother, there should be a hole in each of the quadrants of the carving. Please take the corresponding element from each of these jars and place them into the appropriate holes,\u201d Thorin said. \n        Selyn saluted. With a rapid series of strobing blue flashes, Selyn did as requested. He put some soil in the earth section, some water in the water one, and lit a small candle with the powder in the third jar. He came to an abrupt stop, looking around confusedly in mid-air.\n        \u201cWait, what should I do for the air section?\u201d Selyn asked. \n        \u201cBlow on it!\u201d Thorin said with a smile. \n        Selyn blinked over to the hole in the air section, then puffed himself up large as he completely filled his lungs. With a soft sound like a tire leaking air, Selyn blew with all his might into the final hole.\n        Each element that had been inserted into the door was suddenly sucked into their holes. The ancient door creaked and groaned as it slowly swung open on its own. The pair of explorers stood in the opening, Thorin\u2019s lantern illuminating a patch of ground just through the doorway. \n        \u201cWell. What now?\u201d Selyn asked. \n        \u201cNow, my small friend. Now, we see what this place really has to offer,\u201d Thorin said.\n        The two stepped into the unknown.\n"}

","targets":"        A bloodhound and a husky howled a heartbreaking duet, sad enough for an old country song. A Jack Russell terrier and a nervous chihuahua yapped along in solidarity. Pearl tried to stick her nose through the bars of the cage to figure out where she was. Emotion overtook her, and she let out a low, woeful cry.\n        The very nice lady that had been taking care of her for the past three days leaned down, and opened the cage. She scratched Pearl\u2019s ears. In a gentle voice, she said, \u201cAww, Pearl. Don\u2019t be sad. You\u2019re going to your new home today.\u201d\n        She slipped a leash around Pearl\u2019s neck and led her out. They entered the lobby. Maria, Pearl\u2019s new person, eagerly awaited their arrival. Her eyes lit up when she saw the tan and white Labrador-beagle mutt. She squatted down.\n        \u201cThere she is! Come here, sweet girl. Are you ready to go home, Pearl?\u201d Maria greeted her excitedly. \n        Pearl approached Maria and sniffed her outstretched hand. Maria lovingly petted her head, and Pearl wagged her tail a little. \n        The nice lady rubbed Pearl\u2019s nose, and handed the leash over to Maria. Pearl\u2019s sweet disposition and adorable smile made her a fan favorite at the rescue. Several staff members came to give her goodbye pets and scratches. \n        They stepped outside. Pearl raised her nose in the air and inhaled all the new smells. She scurried to a nearby patch of grass and put her nose to the ground. Maria patiently followed Pearl, who had found a scent trail. She wildly sniffed the soft grass and felt the warmth of the sun on her coat.\n        Once she was satisfied with her smelling adventure, Maria gently helped her in the front seat of the car. Pearl had only ever ridden in the bed of a pickup truck. The cushioned seats, the lights, the dings, the music. It was a little overwhelming, and she started to shake.\n        Maria gave Pearl a kiss on the head and scratched her chin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you're so scared. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d\n        As they drove down the street, Pearl pressed her nose to the window to get a look at passing cars and buildings. Her nose prints dotted the window. Maria rolled the window down, and Pearl stuck her head out. Her ears flopped in the wind. She smiled, eyes squinted, tongue out, reveling in the blast of fresh air. \n        The car pulled in the driveway of an unfamiliar house. Maria helped Pearl out of the car and let her meander around the yard.         Determined to find the squirrel she caught a whiff of, she looked up at a towering pecan tree. A dove cooed at her from its nest, and Pearl jumped up on the trunk of the tree to get a better look. There was no chain around this tree to restrain her. Pearl took great delight being able to explore all ends of the yard. \n        \u201cC\u2019mon, Pearl, Let\u2019s meet Frankie!\u201d Maria said, leading her up the front porch steps. \n        The minute the key entered the lock, ferocious barking exploded from inside the house. Pearl tried to dig her freshly clipped nails into the concrete. Not only had she never been in a house before, there was clearly an enormous beast on the other side of the door. Maria opened the door and tried to coax Pearl across the threshold. Vicious growls echoed through the house.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s okay. That\u2019s just Frankie,\u201d Maria said.\n        Pearl reluctantly stepped into the entryway, head down and tail tucked between her legs. She watched Maria cross the living room to a gated doorway. \n        \u201cFrankie! Your new friend is here!\u201d Maria made kissy noises at the monster in the other room. \n        Pearl took a few steps forward but maintained her distance. Behind the gate, stood a squatty, barrel chested dachshund.  The beast stomped her short front legs and let out a joyful, \u201cwoo woo.\u201d The gate opened, and Frankie zipped into the living room. Her whole body wiggled when she wagged her tail. She darted around the room, barking joyfully. \n        \u201cLook who has the zoomies!\u201d Maria sat on the floor a couple of feet from Pearl, who Frankie had yet to notice. Frankie leapt up on Maria and enthusiastically licked her face.\n        Once Frankie settled down, she finally noticed Pearl. She stood completely still for a moment. Her tail started to wag. Her toenails clicked on the hardwood floor as she took a few steps closer to Pearl. They exchanged sniffs. Satisfied with her findings, Frankie bowed to Pearl and let out a playful, \u201cwoof.\u201d\n        Frankie dashed into the living room. Pearl looked at Maria for approval. \u201cGo get her, girl!\u201d\n        Pearl bounced into the living room. Panting happily, she tried to keep up with her new friend. Interesting new sights and smells kept sidetracking her. She picked through the basket of well-loved, slobbered on toys. Then, she tested two pink, fuzzy beds, one small to fit         Frankie and one big to fit her. On a bookcase, she even spotted Waffles, a cranky, orange and white cat. He hissed and swiped at Pearl\u2019s nose when she tried to greet him with a sniff. Her new roommate\u2019s unfriendly welcome hurt her feelings more than it hurt her nose, and she retreated to her bed to sulk.\n        Frankie was much more hospitable than the cat and took her job as little big sister very seriously. She demonstrated the wooden ramp she used to get on and off the couch. Pearl could have easily jumped on and off the couch. Nonetheless, she followed Frankie up and down the ramp. When Pearl needed to go outside, she sat by the front door. Frankie showed her to the backdoor and taught her how to scratch on it to get the humans\u2019 attention.\n         Securing the backyard was an essential part of outside time. The poodle next door was caught peeking through a small hole in the fence, Frankie kicked her short back legs in a display of her dominance. A cloud of dust stirred up behind her, and she barked a stern warning at the neighbor. Squirrel patrol was also serious business, The dogs circled the trunk of the tree. The squirrels chattered and dropped pecan shells on their heads in the ultimate sign of disrespect. Frankie confidently strutted around the perimeter for one final check.         Pearl lumbered behind her friend with great exuberance. Maria let them back in and rewarded them with a piece of cheese for their brave service. \n\tEvening arrived, and Pearl\u2019s eyelids felt heavy. She yawned loudly and rested her head on her front paws. Frankie sprawled out in the bigger of the two pink beds. Occasionally she would whine and kick her little legs, as she chased squirrels in her dream.\n\tMaria smiled at the exhausted pair and asked, \u201cAre you ready to go night night?\u201d\n\tFrankie awoke from her dead sleep and darted down the hall to a new room. Pearl stuck close to Maria, who turned out the living room lights and proceeded down the hallway. Frankie was already on the bed. She aggressively dug a blanket at the end of the bed, turned, and pawed it a couple of times for good measure. Snout first, she burrowed under the blanket, where she would remain the rest of the night. Maria climbed under the covers while Pearl watched from the floor. \n\t\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Come on, sweet girl,\u201d said Maria.\n\tPearl ascended the ramp up to the bed. Annoyed by the movement, Frankie growled half-heartedly and readjusted under the blanket. Maria motioned for her to come closer. Pearl rested her head on the pillow next to Maria and licked her nose. She snuggled up to her new person and dozed off to belly rubs. \n"}

His guide, Junior, drove the vehicle slowly and steadily. The other guide, Lethabo, kept watch with a hunting rifle standing up in the back seat through a hole in the canopy. \n        Life in this wilderness is harsh and deadly.\n        Kudu stood by the roadside as the Toyota passed, their magnificent curved horns and striped and speckled faces watching passively.\n        \u201cThey have no fear of people,\u201d Harry noticed.\n        \u201cNah. Not too bright,\u201d said Junior. \u201cThey feed on leaves and fruit, everything else hunts them.\u201d\n        \u201cCat in the tree,\u201d announced Lethabo. \n        The Land Cruiser slowed, and Junior scanned the treetops and then pointed. \u201cThere!\u201d \n        Sure enough, a black shape with feral yellow eyes peered down from a large branch high above.\n        \u201cA jaguar. They can pull an animal three times their weight into the trees,\u201d Lethabo said softly. He kept his eyes in the trees as the cunning predator faded from sight.\n        The Toyota rounded the next bend, and a giraffe poked its head out of a thicket of acacia trees, chewing affably. \n        The tallest land mammals in the world. They have tiny heads and a neck so long it almost looks like a spotted tree. \n        The giraffe seemed to look right at them.\n        Excellent eyesight and even better hearing.\n        Harry took a half dozen photos of the beautiful animal.\n        The Land Cruiser made it to another clearing, and there stood a magnificent elephant. With its banana leaf ears, floppy trunk, and wrinkled body, it made a majestic picture. It ground its body next to a tall baobab tree, pushing it over. After the tree fell, the elephant began stripping the tender bark. \n        The Toyota slowed to a halt, and Junior pointed to the large male stuffing strips of bark into its mouth. \u201cThe elephant is a very protected animal, but they are also very damaging to the environment. They eat 24 hours a day and knock down trees. They could ruin an entire valley if they are not controlled.\u201d\n        Lethabo nodded. \u201cWe will tell base camp about this bull. There are hunters who will pay big money to hunt the creature.\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019re going to shoot it?\u201d asked Harry as he took several photos.\n        Junior nodded. \u201cThe money from trophy hunting helps the village economy and controls the elephant population. This provides a monetary incentive for the local population to resist poaching. More money for the locals in trophy hunting.\u201d\n        The bull elephant slowly turned in their direction. The pachyderm took a few steps in their direction and then seemed to charge.\n        \u201cIs he going to chase us?\u201d Harry asked. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Junior said. \u201cMost animals, like lions and elephants, will use charging as a scare tactic. If you don\u2019t run, they won\u2019t chase you. \u201c\n        \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d said Harry, eyes wide.\n        \u201cSeriously,\u201d said Lethabo. \u201cThe animal will wonder why you aren\u2019t scared and turn around. If you run, there\u2019s really no good way that turns out.\u201d\n        After a few steps, the elephant stopped charging, changed its mind, and started feeding on another tree. \n        Junior accelerated the Land Cruiser and pulled away.\n        \u201cWow,\u201d muttered Harry.\n        They proceeded slowly through the bush, and Harry observed a number of antelope and birds like the wood hoopoe, the ground hornbill and a flock of lilac-breasted roller making acrobatic aerial displays.\n        The magazine will love these photos. \n        Another few miles, and the truck stopped, and Junior jumped out. He went over to just the other side of the vehicle path, waving Harry over. Junior showed Harry a pile of poop. \n        \u201cSee that? That is hyena poop. They are the only animals that eat not only the meat, but the bones of their kill.\u201d\n        Sadly, that is the only evidence of hyenas that Harry gets to see.\n        They were returning to camp when Junior slammed on the brakes. \n        Harry searched both left and right in the low brush. \u201cWhat are we looking for?\u201d\n        Lethabo tapped his shoulder and pointed ahead. An enormous buffalo stood in the road, chewing, and staring directly at the Land Cruiser. \n        \u201cWon\u2019t he get out of our way?\u201d Harry asks.\n        \u201cRemember when I said almost all animals would turn around?\u201d\n        \u201cYes,\u201d Harry says, nodding.\n        \u201cWell, the buffalo is the exception.\u201d Lethabo chambered a.375 into his bolt-action rifle. \u201cThey will charge and keep coming. If he charges us, he could damage the vehicle, and we wouldn\u2019t make it back to camp. We might not make it back alive.\u201d\n        The buffalo calmly remained in the middle of the path, studying them. Finally deciding, it turned around and strolled lazily away, disappearing into the thick foliage without looking back.\n        On the return to camp, Junior slowed the Land Cruiser and pointed to a small clearing of elephant grass. There, Harry spotted two lions. One male with a golden mane like fire and a muscular body that could rip any living animal apart, and a female lion, smaller and more lithe, but a deadly hunter. They lay together lazily amid the grass, rubbing gently and grooming one another.\n        \u201cExtraordinary,\u201d Harry said.\n        \u201cThey sleep twenty hours a day, while the females hunt,\u201d Lethabo chuckled. \u201cThe other four hours a day, the male lion eats and mates. It\u2019s quite a life.\u201d\n        As the sun rose the next morning, Harry rose from his tent to find a harem of springbok strolling around the campground. He observed Junior standing at the edge of his tent, sipping coffee and smiling, as he watched the animals. Harry turned and retrieved his camera from the tent, snapping a dozen shots of the beautiful animals, with distinctive horns and black and white markings. With no warning, the animals began bounding about, two meters into the air, with a straight leg posture. \n        \u201cThat\u2019s called pronking,\u201d laughed Junior. \n        Harry observed the springbok pronk for several minutes. They bounded through the camp, around the perimeter, and through it again. Then they stopped just as suddenly before strolling off to a patch of nearby succulents and resuming grazing.\n        After breakfast, Junior and Lethabo took Harry on a trail walk. \n        \u201cI have three more hours before I catch my flight,\u201d Harry said, swallowing the last of his coffee.\n        Lethabo waved playfully. \u201cPlenty of time, bwana.\u201d\n        Harry took photos of flamingos and cape parrots, and he even got numerous nice photos of a pair of ostriches.\n        After another mile of hiking, Junior waved for Henry to pause. Ahead, a great growling emerged. Slowly, the trio crept forward. Lethabo motioned for Henry to crouch low and move forward. Over a rise, in the small valley below, a great cloud of dust arose. \n        Lions bringing down another kill? \n        Another growl, and a sound like two cars colliding. As the dust settled, Harry saw that two huge rhinos were fighting. They circled one another, horns to the ground, pawing at the dirt. \n        Harry snapped the last dozen photos he could fit on his thumb drive.\n        The rhinos snorted and ran at one another, managing to dodge impaling one another with their horns by inches. Another massive collision. They jostled and pushed one another back and forth for twenty minutes until finally one of the rhinos decided to give up the fight and ran off.\n        Time to get back and catch my flight home."}

The air smells fresh and botanical, as if the whole place is a garden. Out past the bright-green fields, I can see flowers of different shades; red, purple, pink, and blue. The trees look rich and lush. I\u2019m hoping my map might show me something that I haven't seen yet, but it looks exactly the same as it has since I started this quest. I guess I\u2019ll have to figure this out on my own. I\u2019ve been to four different regions, all possibilities, but found no sign of my family in any of them. This is my last stop, and it has to be right. \n       For the past three months, I\u2019ve been searching for my family; aunts, cousins, uncles, and grandparents. I know they\u2019re out there, I just have to figure out where. My parents never gave me any hints about the rest of my family, except that their last name was Kensington, and that there were four basic areas they could be. When they both passed, I swore I would set out to find them. My mother would tell me tales of one of my uncles who became obsessed with power and brainwashed the rest of the family, maybe even a whole village. Although I loved my mother, I knew she had a way of creating grandiose stories. I have to find out on my own if this is the truth. I\u2019ve been alone for months - with no home or family to go back to, so here I am, wandering into strange territory, attempting this possibly impossible journey.\n       Makersland is mostly farms and merchants that own small shops full of hand-crafted items. I grew up in a large city with buildings that are so close together, it's amazing people can even walk down the street. Here, it\u2019s open and spacious. The vast stretch of land has an air of loneliness to it, but it\u2019s also refreshing to have such an open area to explore. As I begin walking down the hill ahead, I hear the faint chirping of birds high above me, slightly hiding behind branches and leaves. They\u2019re babies - fresh and new, their stringy feathers sticking out in all directions, their beaks too large for their small faces. I stop and relish listening to them, granting myself a moment to appreciate the way nature communicates. I whisper goodbye to them and keep heading down the hill, my arms swinging at my side and my brown knapsack pushing against my shoulder blades. \n       Once I reach the bottom of the hill, I see an older gentleman sitting on top of a large wagon, two horses, one black and another with white with brown spots, gently pulling it. He sees me and says, \u201cWhoaaa,\u201d with a slight vibrato in his voice. The horses stop, and the man lets go of the reins. He looks at me with curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d His voice is unsteady but deep. \n       \u201cNo sir. I just arrived. I\u2019m looking for my family.\u201d         \n       \u201cWell, I\u2019m a merchant in the area. Maybe I know them. Name?\u201d\n       \u201cI\u2019m Ezra, but my family's last name is Kensington.\u201d\n       \u201cKensington? Kensington?\u201d The man thought for a moment, placing his pointer finger and his thumb on his chin overtop his  white, wiry beard. \u201cNope! Don\u2019t know \u2018em.\u201d My disappointment must have been obvious, because then he reached into the back of his wagon, the wood underneath him creaking and wobbly, and pulled out a medium-sized red cloth bag. \n      \u201cHere you go. You can have this, free of charge, in case you get hungry.\u201d\n       I opened the bag and could smell the intoxicating scent of fresh berries and bread. \n       \u201cOh, and, uh, here. Take this, too,\u201d he said, handing me a canister full of cool water. \u201cSometimes the trees don\u2019t provide enough shade. You\u2019ll need to stay quenched.\u201d\n       \u201cThank you so much, sir,\u201d I responded with accepting gratitude. \n       \u201cHave a good journey. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for!\u201d \n       With that, the man grabbed the horses\u2019 reins and gave a \u201cHa!\u201d They snorted and continued down the path ahead.\n        I came across a creek, the sun\u2019s rays causing a crystal-like glisten on top of the running water. I sat down in the grass and could feel the moist soil underneath me. I pulled out the sack from the old man and began picking at the berries and bread, savoring each bite. Every once in a while, a fish would jump out, as though they were playing some sort of game with each other. There was something so tranquil about listening to the splashes and the rush of the water over rocks and pebbles. It looked inviting and warm. After I ate, leaving just a small amount of berries in the bag, I removed my boots, rolled up my trousers, and stepped in the creek, each foot causing a small splash to emerge around my ankles and the bottoms of my legs. It felt both soothing and invigorating - a relaxing excitement. \n        Ahead of me stood two mountains with a narrow path leading between them. After drying my feet and putting my boots back on, I approached the pass and continued my journey. It was gravel-like, with short, plush grass on either side. In the distance, I could hear what sounded like joyful violins and conversation. I decided not to look at my map, but follow my ears, instead. Hopeful, I began walking with broader strides, each step feeling heavier and more impatient. As I came to a clearing, the mountains now behind me, I stopped. I heard a sound that reminded me of a small snicker, but not so much a human laugh. As I looked to my right, a pack of baby foxes sat before me, each one with perked-up ears and a curious face. I grabbed a handful of berries from the red bag and tossed them over to the pups. Their noses wiggled, and they swiftly sprinted toward the snacks, gobbling up every last one, their faces now covered in shades of purple and red. \n        With the evergreens before me, I continued on, still following the sounds of violins and laughter. Eventually, I could make out what looked to be a small village. Nothing was large and extravagant; each home was quaint and whimsical. Still with great hope that this is where my family could be, I walked down the path. It was lined with lights and banners that held emblems I had never seen. I was enchanted by the Tudor homes, the small stables that held horses and cows, and the fences that held chickens and turkeys. I breathed in and then exhaled with a smile, pleased at what I had found. Most places I had come across along my journey were not this cozy and unassuming. \n        The homes had a faint, soothing glow radiating from their windows - flickering candles and lights. I happened upon the square, where all of the townspeople were laughing and dancing, paying me no mind. Before I dropped in on the celebration, I decided to hop into a small shop that sold fresh vegetables, fruits, and baked goods. \n        There was a young woman behind the counter. She had curly, red hair that hung down by her ears, freckles, and captivating green eyes. \n        \u201cHello, are you a traveler?\u201d \n        \u201cI am. I\u2019m\u2026well, I came here to look for my family.\u201d\n        \u201cYour family? Hmm. I don\u2019t know many people here, I\u2019m new, too, but I bet you\u2019re hungry, hm?\u201d\n        \u201cI am, actually. I haven\u2019t eaten since I was up by that creek.\u201d\n        \u201cYou mean Longfish Creek? My, that is far. Please, look around.\u201d\n        I sashayed around the store, looking at vegetables, breads, fruits, meats, and sweets. There was a lot to choose from, but eventually my nose made its way to a large pot of stew, the warm carrots, celery, and meats stimulating my nose, and a miniature strawberry shortcake. I grabbed the ladle and poured some stew into one of the bowls sitting next to the pot. I paid the woman behind the counter and stepped back outside. There was a small porch that held tables and chairs, where I sat and ate my food, the savory veggies warming my body. I placed my bowl on a rack that I assumed was for collecting dishes, and started heading towards the square. As I approached, a loud and long Moooooo pierced my eardrum, causing me to jump and my heart to race. I looked to my right and saw a cow staring at me from behind a long, wooden fence. I patted his head and finally stepped into the square. \n       The townspeople noticed me right away. After all, I didn\u2019t quite look like them. It was obvious I was a city boy, and they... well, they weren\u2019t. Their clothes were blue, brown, and white, all subdued colors. The men wore overalls and the women were in either dresses or slacks. An older woman with an accent walked up to me. \u201cExcuse me, boy. Who are you?\u201d \n        \u201cMy name is Ezra. I\u2019m here to find my family.\u201d\n        \u201cOhhh. We don\u2019t know an Ezra here,\u201d the woman said, catching her breath and laughing at the same time. \n        \"Well, the family I\u2019m looking for - their last name is Kensington.\u201d \n        \u201cWe don\u2019t know that name, either, dear. But why don\u2019t you come sit down and have a drink?\u201d\n        The woman pulled on my arm, the creases in her hands crumpling up. I sat down at a round table, the deep tanzanite-moonlit sky beginning to sprinkle down on me. The people did not care about the light rain, they continued to dance. The woman handed me a mug topped with white foam. I drank it down and could feel my cheeks turning red with each sip. She went back to dancing, and I watched them in their joyous celebration.\n        Over the next few days, I stayed in a small inn, and I learned the village was called Elvor. I asked everyone I met if they knew the last name Kensington, but to no avail. Finally, the day before I was going to head back to the city, I met an old man named Arthur. His hair was bright white; his face and hands crowded with age spots. The bags underneath his dark eyes puffed out like blowfish. \u201cI know Kensington,\u201d he said, deeply and quietly. He was sitting in a rocking chair outside of his home, the chair slowly creaking with every movement. I walked up to him and knelt down. \u201cYou know a family with the last name Kensington?\u201d \n        \u201cSit, boy,\u201d he responded. \n        I sat on the steps next to him, and he turned his chair towards me. \n        \u201cYou are related to the family Kensington? I have a story for you. The man, Julian, was a good boy growing up.\u201d\n        \u201cJulian? Did he have any sisters?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, a couple of them. Amy and Florence.\u201d\n        My ears perked up.\n        \u201cFlorence. Florence was my mom.\u201d \n        \u201cFlorence was a sweet girl. I remember her. Amy was sweet, too, for a while.\u201d His voice seemed to get deeper and almost turn into a whisper. \u201cYou see, boy, Julian one day went wandering off into the woods. In fact, those woods aren\u2019t far from here. If you head about five miles north, you\u2019ll come to them. That day, Julian found some kind of creature. Legend has it, it was a dragon. The dragon held mesmerizing eyes, fully hypnotizing Julian. When he returned home, he entranced the rest of your family, too. Except Florence. She was the only one capable enough to get away. They chased after her, but it wasn\u2019t worth it. After they started terrorizing villages, the counsel decided it would be best to put them in jail. Locked up together, they all fought to the death in their cells; a whole family turned against each other and torn apart. I\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you this, boy.\u201d\n        I decided to stay in Elvor; after all, I had no reason to go back to the city, and I had found a home, although it wasn\u2019t the one I expected. Many days and nights I thought about possibly venturing into the woods, searching for the dragon, or for some indication that the tale of my family was all true. After all, the man who told me the story of my family was old - could it possibly be that he didn\u2019t know what he was saying? Making it up? \n        I decided, maybe, some things are best left unknown."}

I\u2019d finally acquired my own stand at a daily flea market, which I happily titled \u201cSally\u2019s Antique Curios\u201d, and offered a wide assortment of rare goods. The shop was a true labor of love, one that slowly became more laborious than lovely. I stayed afloat financially, but at times just barely. One loyal customer made all the difference.\n        April was a veteran bargain hunter and a bona fide cat lover. The feng shui established in her home took her a lifetime to cultivate. No two objects were purchased on the same day, and none were ever acquired at full price. Most amenities, especially the furniture, were decades older than her, a point she was especially proud of considering their high-quality condition. Each item in her wardrobe, China cabinets, and bookshelves, but especially her antique cat-statue collection, was thoughtfully selected, handpicked, and vetted for its affordability, quality, and corresponding style. Each detail had to reflect April\u2019s eccentric, vintage taste. She was influenced by interior designers like Sister Parish and Dorothy Draper, and she had a predilection for all things Ert\u00e9. \n        I know all this because she\u2019d repeat these details to me every Saturday when she came in. I didn\u2019t consider whether she was exaggerating in her boasts, since she left my stand each Saturday with a cart full of expensive goods.\n        Her constant brags, while occasionally irritating, certainly made me curious what her house looked like. Still, I wasn\u2019t sure I could come over and manage to hold a full conversation with her. While she saw me weekly, we weren\u2019t necessarily friends. I was the gatekeeper she had to haggle with to secure the antiques she wanted, which more often than not were cat-related.\n        April was short and stout, always dressed for a different century. That Saturday, she donned a yellow gingham bandana that covered up her hair, a large tweed peacoat, and tiny bifocals that flickered like candles in the light as she moved. \n        \u201cHow much for the cat, Sally?\u201d She inquired, holding up a huge bronze cat statue. I was surprised she could lift it. \n        I never haggled with anyone but her, as she was the only one to try. My lack of firm \u2018no-haggling\u2019 standards directed April back to my stand again and again. \n        \u201cFour hundred.\u201d\n        She shot me a glare like I\u2019d threatened her. \u201cCome on. This?\u201d she squeaked.\n        I raised my eyebrows. \u201cSorry, April, it\u2019s a Gary Lane original. One of a kind, and pure bronze. I can\u2019t take any less.\u201d \n        \u201cNot even three hundred eighty-five, Sal? I know the perfect place for it. It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d\n        I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cFifteen bucks less? That\u2019s a whole dinner you\u2019re stealing from me, you know.\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019ll eat with the rest of the money. Three hundred and eighty-five, and I\u2019ve already named him Henry. He has to come home with me.\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t budge on Henry, April.\u201d I always entertained her, but I was uncomfortably close to not making rent. \n        She rolled her eyes. \u201cThree eighty-five, and then throw in this hundred-dollar lamp for my bathroom.\u201d She grabbed a lamp I\u2019d just gotten in, with an iron base shaped like a cat in a scuba suit.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s two hundred, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n        April tutted her tongue. \u201cSally, you\u2019re killing me. Cut an old lady some slack.\u201d\n        I smiled, shaking my head in resignation. \"Okay, the best I can do is five fifty for both.\u201d\n        April gave me a tentative glance, looked down at the items, and nodded. \u201cAlright. Five fifty for you, why not? Quality is quality.\u201d                         She brought out her personalized checkbook, full of pink checks with cartoon kittens beside the address. After filling one out, she tore it from the book, handed it to me, and waited patiently as I attempted to wrap up the items. I loaded them onto her red wagon while she talked to herself.\n        \u201cI know exactly where these will go. Such steals. They\u2019re going to look absolutely marvelous,\u201d she reflected, her New Yorker accent extra prominent in her excitement.\n        \u201cI want to see your collection someday, April. It\u2019s got to be so cool.\u201d\n        \u201cBetter than cool. It\u2019s divine.\u201d\n        She left without another word, slowly towing her goods behind her. I figured April lived close, mentioning she\u2019d walk with her wagon all the way home. I\u2019d never asked questions, but I was always tempted to. Did she live alone, like me? Or did someone else have to live surrounded by bizarre antiques?\n        Collecting just as much as she did, I worried it was only a matter of time until I grew up to be April. I\u2019d filled my quaint room, also walking distance from the flea market, to the brim with relics I did my best to sell. I imagined it as a less impressive version of whatever         April\u2019s home looked like. When I wasn\u2019t wandering through local antique shops, I was researching and ordering online for new purchases at home. My landlord was likely annoyed with all the boxes piling up every week, but at least I always made rent.\n        The house across the street accumulated nearly as many packages. Without the litany of boxes littered across the front porch on a weekly basis, I\u2019d wonder if anyone lived there at all. I found myself intrigued by it daily, studying it intently as I came and went from the flea market. The house was structurally identical to every other house around it but was painted a bright, unmissable purple. Its large F        rench windows were perpetually darkened by thick shades, and apart from the orange glow of an automatic porch lamp, it seemed no lights ever shone from the property. Despite this, the people inside were avid online shoppers. I felt a sort of kinship with them, though                         I\u2019d never met, or even seen, the inhabitants before.\n        I\u2019d always meant to ask my landlord about the house as my fascination grew, but I found myself savoring the mystery.         Occasionally, I'd catch a glimpse of the door opening after dusk\u2014a dark figure pulling the gifts in with a swift pull of the doormat. As far as I knew, I lived across from a family of vampires. \n        \u201cThe place across the street? It\u2019s just a weird old lady,\u201d the landlord\u2019s son, a twenty-four-year-old renting the master bedroom, informed me after I joked about it. We sat at the table, like we did most mornings as of late. Though I\u2019d try to avoid it if I could, the timing of our respective jobs made it so we had the same allotted breakfast time. \n        He shoveled a big spoonful of cornflakes into his mouth before speaking. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy,\u201d he gurgled.\n        I didn\u2019t put much stock in the things Bradley Jr. told me, but I decided to humor him. \u201cCrazy?\u201d I sarcastically echoed, only partially listening while I scrolled through sales.\n        \u201cCrazy cat lady vibes.\u201d He shoveled another spoonful into his open mouth, barely stopping to speak. \u201cShe\u2019s always shut up in that house. She\u2019s got no family, just cats. And all the weird stuff she keeps bringing home.\u201d\n        I put down my phone and looked at him with furrowed brows. \n        \u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d\n        He shrugged, rising from his seat and walking his bowl to the kitchen sink. \u201cCardboard boxes, bags, wrapped things. She pulls them into her garage in a little wagon. The one time I was outside while she did it, she glared at me.\u201d\n        I stood, walking towards the living room window and pulling down the blinds to take a look at the mysterious house. Could it be April's?\n        \u201cSo because she collects things and because you were staring, she\u2019s crazy.\u201d I turned back around to look at him. \n        Bradley Jr. rolled his eyes at me. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just what I\u2019ve heard. Lonely people do lonely-person things, like collecting old junk.\u201d He raised his eyebrows at me before heading up the stairs, likely pleased with his insult.\n        My mind was made up, especially considering his jest. I'd pay her a brief visit. I\u2019d always wanted to see April\u2019s house, and now would be my chance.\n        She\u2019d mentioned once in passing that she had a sweet tooth, and I hoped gingerbread cookies would suffice as a welcome gift. A seasonal thank-you for her patronage wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary, and plus, I\u2019d finally be able to catch a glimpse of her accumulated loot. I cut out designs of cats from the dough, considering how many cat statues she\u2019d bought from my store. \u2018Crazy cat lady indeed\u2019, I thought with a grin.\n        I stood at her prospective doorstep after three brisk knocks, clutching a covered plate of cookies. The longer I waited, the weirder I felt standing there. April would probably be alarmed more than anything else. And what if this wasn\u2019t April\u2019s house, just some April-like old woman?\n        \u201cHello?\u201d I heard her unmistakable voice call out from within, and after a full minute of listening to the locks unlatch, the door creaked open. She wore a purple hat, a bright yellow sweater, and dark blue jeans. She adjusted her bifocals, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose, making her eyes look comically large inside the tiny lenses.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re selling door-to-door now, Sally?\u201d She asked, and I laughed, shaking my head.\n        \u201cNo, I just wanted to bring you these. You know I live across the street from you?\u201d I gestured back towards my place as I spoke.                                 \u201cNot to be a stalker or anything, but I\u2026\u201d How did I explain that I knew she lived here?\n        \u201cI\u2026 saw you coming home the other day and was so surprised that we live so close.\u201d\n        She stared at me. \u201cYeah. How odd.\u201d\n        I lifted the tinfoil-covered plate of cookies, doing my best to brush away the pervasive sensation of awkwardness.  \u201cI, uh, made some gingerbread cookies for you. For the holidays, and as a neighborly hello.\u201d\n        The smell of rosemary and cigarettes wafted out from the doorway. It called my attention to the mysterious interior, and I covertly glanced behind her. A large ceramic cat, frozen in the precarious position of batting the air below it, sat on the edge of a tall, glass-topped table. In the corner of the room to the left of the table, another cat statue posed mid-stretch, its spine curving high into the air.                         Suddenly, a real cat, an orange tabby, approached its owner and looked at me with its big green eyes.\n        I smiled down at it as she pulled the plate from my hands. \u201cI do love a little gingerbread,\u201d she cooed. \u201cThank you, doll. Would you like to have one with me for all your hard work?\u201d\n        Before I could reply, she pointed at me with a stern look. \u201cNothing\u2019s for sale, you know.\u201d\n        I laughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t buy anything back.\u201d\n        She motioned for me to follow her, and I slowly entered a paradise just as skillfully arranged as I\u2019d dreamed. \n        The entire living room was candlelit, bathing the vast assortment of curios within it in a soft yellow light. Antiques of all shapes, sizes, and colors covered the space. Cats I\u2019d sold to her months before, as well as three living ones of her own, sat among the sprawling vines of potted plants, peppered like Easter eggs among the candles, grandfather clocks, rocking chairs, and sculptures. With the extensive amount of stuff, it could\u2019ve easily looked scattered and unorganized, but April expertly fashioned it into a comprehensive, cozy world of its own. A big black typewriter sat atop a mahogany secretary desk, covered in hand-carved wooden nutcrackers. The coffee table featured three large ceramic cats on it, not just the batting one, and an orange one, up on its hind legs, bookended the left side of a stack of old novels. \n        Exquisite paintings and tapestries covered the walls, portraying sailboats, still lifes of fruit bowls, and, naturally, playful cats. Below them were more leafy plants, bushy yet well-pruned. A grand piano sat in the next room attached to the kitchen, covered in strings of yellow Christmas lights and vintage toy soldiers.\n        I was so mesmerized by her collection that I nearly missed her saying, \u201cCome, sit down!\u201d \n        I changed my mind. I desperately hoped I\u2019d grow up to be April.\n        By the time I reached her farmhouse-style kitchen table, I was completely speechless. A calico cat brushed up against my leg as I sat.\n        \u201cI have to say, April, your house is just as you described.\u201d I gushed, feeling like I\u2019d stumbled into another universe. \u201cI mean, everything is perfectly placed, and it's all so unique.\u201d\n        She lit up with pride, adjusting her glasses. \u201cWhy, thank you, Sally. I\u2019ve really made this place marvelous, just the way I\u2019ve always wanted. But I couldn\u2019t have done it without you, you know.\u201d\n        I hesitated in surprise. It was the sweetest she\u2019d ever been toward me. \u201cReally?\u201d\n        April nodded, glancing across her self-made wonderland like a queen would survey her kingdom. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve got an incredible eye.\u201d\n        She turned to look at me with a wink. \u201cBut hey, so do you. Your antiques make this place what it is! I didn\u2019t collect too many cats before I found your shop. You\u2019ve got such an eye for cats.\u201d \n        While I was somewhat perplexed by her final comment, her compliments filled me with pride. I smiled, happy that I was helping fulfill someone else\u2019s dreams, however unique. \n        \u201cDo you have people over often? This place needs to be seen!\u201d\n        She shook her head. \u201cNot really, other than my son\u2019s family once in a while. I\u2019ve heard the town thinks I\u2019m a crazy cat lady.\u201d\n        I wanted to laugh at her bluntness but kept myself quiet. \u201cNo, really?\u201d\n        April sighed. \u201cYeah. I think it\u2019s because I keep to myself. That, and all the cats don\u2019t help my reputation.\u201d\n        I laughed with abandon then, and when she gave me a skeptical glance, I gave her a playful tap on the arm. \u201cWho needs \u2018em? Cats are awesome. You\u2019ve kept me in business because of them.\u201d\n        \u201cYou kept yourself in business!\u201d She replied in a high pitch. \u201cThey\u2019re great antiques.\u201d\n        For a moment, the two of us sat in silence. She passed me the plate of cookies, partially covered in aluminum foil. I grabbed one, and she took another, placing the plate back down on the rustic table before us.\n        \u201cTo cats.\u201d She said, tapping her cookie on mine like a \u2018cheers\u2019. I raised mine as we both laughed in spite of ourselves.\n        \u201cTo cats.\u201d I echoed, taking a bite.\n"}

Scientists were trying to unlock the mysteries of the universe with an even bigger and more powerful supercollider, but somehow knocked down the doors between our world and the places where magic exists. Magical energy flooded into the world along ancient channels, like water flowing through dry canals. Sacred sites were slowly empowered, and supernatural creatures who needed magic to survive started returning from their long exile.\n\tOf course, we didn\u2019t know it at the time, at least until that first group of elves came through the Newgrange passage tomb in Ireland right at the winter solstice. When the sunlight touched the back wall of the chamber, about fifteen elves walked out of the wall and introduced themselves to the tourists and guides and explained all of this.\n\tAfter that, more supernatural beings started appearing. Someone got a high quality video of a real sasquatch wandering the Pacific Northwest. A dragon climbed out of the earth near the source of the Yellow River in China, settled near a small village, and offered protection and blessings. A unicorn appeared in the Black Forest in Germany. There were other sightings of creatures or people that had been considered mythological, dismissed as hoaxes for social media engagement.\n\tI think the breaking point, what finally convinced people, was when an angel appeared in front of a crowd of witnesses to a religious leader known for hypocrisy. There\u2019s still video out there of this entity, biblically accurate with multiple eyes and wheels of fire, chastising the man for his actions.\n\tNormally, it takes at least a couple of generations for people to get used to major changes; I think having so many obvious events and beings made that happen faster. There\u2019s been a lot of growing pains throughout the process, but ten years in, humans are starting to learn how use the available magic for very simple things, the supernatural groups have formed communities and are mostly trying to get along with the humans, and things have settled down enough to where people can mostly co-exist with each other.\n\tThere\u2019s even a growing economy around the supernaturals using their abilities for humans. After all, even elves need to eat, and in today\u2019s capitalistic environment, it\u2019s not like a grocery store is going to accept leaves enchanted to seem like gold coins or paper money. Different beings offered different services, everything from magical dress-making to granting wishes. It was just a matter of finding the right source for your needs. \n\tWhich leads to me. \n\tI\u2019d known even before magic came back that I was genderfluid. Thank goodness for the Internet; I was able to find other people like me, where our gender shifted from week to week, day to day, or even hour to hour. Getting and keeping a job was difficult, but not impossible, and most of my available funds went to a variety of things to help with the dysphoria. I had some good friends who helped when things were really tough, and a fairly stable living situation. But none of it really resolved the core issue: some days, my body felt incorrect, and there was only so much I could do with prosthetics and clothing.\n\tOnce supernaturals started offering their services, I did research on the Internet and in person. I first went to a community of elves near me, but when I talked with them, their magic was all illusions, but nothing that actually changed a person\u2019s body. They made a few suggestions I\u2019m sure they thought were helpful, but which just kicked me into a dysphoria spiral that lasted a week.\n\tA few of my online friends made some other suggestions, but none of them worked out either. The one angel I encountered gave me a platitude about \u201cmortal clay baked in divine light,\u201d and seemed offended when I started crying. On the other side of things, I met with a succubus who admitted she couldn\u2019t help me without creating more trouble than it was worth, since infernal contracts tended to be unfair to the recipient. Most of the other options involved significant amounts of travel, money, and time, none of which I had in any great supply.\n\tI\u2019d more or less given up when I found an online ad for a shop in my hometown. The place was named \u201cThree Wishes,\u201d and the ad suggested the proprietor could resolve any problem, big or small. \n\tOn my next day off, I went looking for the shop, hoping against hope that this was something real instead of a scam or a hoax. The address was unusual, and involved me going through a narrow walkway between two shops in an open-air strip mall. This led to a smaller set of buildings, and right in the middle was the shop, complete with a red brick facing and gold lettering on the windows. \n\tInside, there were overloaded bookshelves on the right, cabinets full of oddities on the left, carpeted floors that muffled all sound, and a wooden counter that mostly blocked access to what looked like storage rooms. A woman stood behind the counter, grinning and playing with her long, emerald, braided hair. But other than her and me, the store was empty.\n\t\u201cHello! Welcome to Three Wishes,\u201d she said in a perky customer service voice. Having worked retail, I recognized the tone instantly. \u201cYou\u2019re my first customer of the day,\u201d she added with a wink.\n\t\u201cHi,\u201d I responded, already feeling disappointment. Overall, the shop looked like most other new age stores I\u2019d visited, both before and after magic came back. \n\tShe blinked at my response, then came out from behind the counter. More accurately, she floated out from behind the counter. From the waist up, she was dressed in a sleeveless emerald silk blouse that matched her hair perfectly, but from the waist down there was a trailing cloud of emerald vapor that narrowed to a point a few inches above floor level.\n\t\u201cWas this more in line with what you were expecting?\u201d She tilted her head, an expression of concern on her voice.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I responded instantly. I paused, trying to find the words, then continued, \u201cI worked retail for way too long. Customer service voice almost always gives me flashbacks to those days.\u201d\n\t\u201cAh, sorry about that,\u201d she nodded. \u201cAlmost everyone who finds the shop is expecting a generic retail experience, even now. You don\u2019t mind me floating like this, do you? Legs can be so tiresome.\u201d\n\tI managed a smile. \u201cNo, be as comfortable as you need.\u201d\n\tShe blinked again, shook her head, and floated closer. \u201cI\u2019m Maragda, unbound genie and owner of the Three Wishes. And you have a very heavy heart.\u201d\n\t\u201cHi, Maragda. Derived from the Latin for emerald?\u201d I watched as she raised an eyebrow.\n\t\u201cOn the nose, but you haven\u2019t shared your name. Or are you worried I\u2019ll take it from you?\u201d\n\tSniffling a bit, I responded, \u201cThat might be a kindness, depending on which name. Usually I go by Hayden, but that\u2019s not the name I got from my parents. And from the little I\u2019ve heard of genies, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re as precise about words as the fae. I wasn\u2019t worried you\u2019d ask for my name, then take it from me.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re definitely one of the more unique mortals it\u2019s been my pleasure to meet,\u201d she declared. \u201cI don\u2019t pry into the private affairs of those who find my shop, but you\u2019re here, there\u2019s nobody else coming, and I think you have a request for me.\u201d\n\tI couldn\u2019t help myself. I started sobbing, gesturing weakly at my body. In between bouts of crying, I explained how I experienced being genderfluid. How there were days when my body was mostly okay, and other days when everything was just wrong no matter what I did. Where sometimes I couldn\u2019t guarantee that my sense of gender would stay the same throughout the day. How going out in public was a risk unless I knew where the gender-neutral restrooms were. How, even with a college degree, it was difficult to find accepting jobs where I could be myself without someone deciding I was too much of a freak. \n\tI\u2019m not sure when I ended up sitting in a chair that hadn\u2019t been there before, but Maragda floated in front of me, listening all the while, handing me tissues, and making sure I drank some ice water that she created out of thin air.\n\t\u201cDid I say a heavy heart?\u201d she said after I\u2019d calmed down. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder your heart hasn\u2019t sunk through the ground.\u201d\n\tI felt better enough to smile at her. \u201cI have friends and I have a therapist. That helps, honestly.\u201d\n\t\u201cYes, but not enough. I have a solid guess as to why you\u2019re here, but I need you to tell me. I don\u2019t grant wishes automatically; being unbound has its advantages. But I\u2019m willing to work out a deal with you, depending on what you ask for.\u201d\n\tI took a deep breath. \u201cI want to be able to make my body match my sense of gender. I guess that falls into the shape-shifting category?\u201d\n\tMaragda asked, \u201cI\u2019m presuming limited to the human form?\u201d At my nod, she continued, \u201cAnd I presume you want to look enough like yourself that regardless of your body, people would still recognize you as you?\u201d\n\t\u201cI think so? I mean, I hadn\u2019t really thought about looking so different that people wouldn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking about it, because thinking about it makes the dysphoria spike.\u201d\n\tShe nodded and moved back a bit. \u201cWhat you\u2019re asking is within my power, but now we get to the part about the cost.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhatever it is \u2013\u201d I started, only to have her shake her head vigorously.\n\t\u201cI know you feel very strongly about this, but for your sake and mine, don\u2019t offer to pay whatever the cost,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not like the infernal folk, I don\u2019t take advantage of people in that way. But if you open that door, it\u2019s possible my magic will take more from you than you\u2019d be comfortable giving up.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh. What do I do then?\u201d\n\t\u201cWe negotiate. My magic works better that way.\u201d\n\tI paused. I really had no idea what to offer a genie in exchange for the power to shapeshift. \u201cUm. I\u2019m kind of at a loss here?\u201d\n\tShe laughed kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. There are four categories of payment a genie will accept. Material goods, usually money or possessions. Intangible elements of a person\u2019s existence, like the memory of a first kiss. Threads of your fate, which means that things that could happen for you would simply not occur. Or services, which in the past included things like dangerous quests.\u201d\n\t\u201cMaterial stuff is right out. I don\u2019t have a lot of it, and I\u2019m not comfortable giving up what I do have. I don\u2019t think intangible is a good choice for me either. Knowing how badly I want this, it\u2019d be something critical to who I am as a person. The same goes for my fate; what happens if I get this, but lose the chance at finding someone to love? Which leaves service, I guess.\u201d\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a start. For what you need, I have a few options. You can make something for me, you can go get something for me, or you could work for me.\u201d\n\tI still wasn\u2019t sure I could stand up, even though I felt like I wanted to pace a bit. \u201cMost of what I make is stories. I write a lot, so I could do something like a thousand and one nights of tales?\u201d\n\tMaragda started chuckling. \u201cSuch an extravagant offer! If you could truly tell me a thousand and one unique stories, at the end you\u2019d have nearly three years of effort even if you wrote one story a day, and my magic would let you shapeshift into anything: animal, vegetable, or mineral.\u201d\n\tI smiled for the first time in what seemed like forever. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I really need? But it\u2019s also a long time to wait for this.\u201d I sipped a bit more at the conjured ice water, and continued, \u201cGetting something for you feels like just another way for me to use up resources I really can\u2019t spare.\u201d\n\t\u201cVery much so,\u201d she agreed. \u201cGenies used to give quests to the well-off who also needed to learn several lessons along the way, which you don\u2019t seem to need.\u201d\n\tI asked, \u201cWhat would working for you involve?\u201d\n\tShe floated aimlessly around a bit. \u201cThis shop exists in this world, even though I have a lot more space inside than the exterior shows. I gather you\u2019re not fond of retail, but the easiest solution would be for you to be my human assistant.\u201d\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know how feasible that would be,\u201d I argued. \u201cI\u2019ve already got a job doing online tech support. While it\u2019s not the best, it pays for my expenses and needs. How would it even work for you to pay me a wage while I\u2019m also working toward that wish?\u201d\n\tMaragda nodded. \u201cThis is why we negotiate. That\u2019s trivial, however. My magic doesn\u2019t treat mundane pay in the same way as payment toward balancing the scales of a wish. And being a genie has advantages in terms of how much I can offer you.\u201d\n\tIntrigued despite myself, I asked, \u201cAnd what would the pay be for working as a human assistant in a genie\u2019s shop?\u201d\n\tShe winked, quoted me a rate double what I was getting at my current job, and when my jaw dropped open, added, \u201cBenefits too. Not that you would need medical, dental, or vision, but there are mortal proprieties to be addressed.\u201d\n\t\u201cHow in the world is this even fair to you to balance out my wish?\u201d\n\t\u201cAgain, my magic considers your effort on my behalf to be something separate from what the mortal world considers fair compensation.\u201d She shrugged with a half smile. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve been lonely and bored. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people in this day and age don\u2019t really have wishes that would lead them here.\u201d\n\tDizzied at the thought of getting what I wanted, I sagged back into the chair. \u201cIf I agree, when would the magic take effect, and would I have to start immediately? I\u2019d at least like to give two weeks notice.\u201d\n\tMaragda grinned. \u201cIf you agree, the wish takes effect immediately. You\u2019ll just start paying off that debt once you start working here, so I wouldn\u2019t wait too long. And no, you don\u2019t have to use the phrase \u2018I wish\u2019 here. Declaration of intent, especially since we\u2019ve talked, is sufficient.\u201d\n\t\u201cThen yes, please, I want this so much I\u2019m trembling.\u201d\n\t\u201cStand up, Hayden, and receive your wish.\u201d When I did, she raised her hands, and a shimmering rainbow mist poured out and enveloped me. I could feel the changes sinking into me, giving me an understanding of how to shape my body. A stress I\u2019d known for so long I\u2019d forgotten it was there lifted off my shoulders as I felt like myself for the first time in my life.\n\t\u201cWelcome to your wish, and being my assistant here at Three Wishes,\u201d Maragda said."}

We are not around any water, and we passed signs telling hikers not to approach the wildlife because they are dangerous. \n       I feel like there is a bit of natural selection here that we should allow; I mean who is really thoughtless enough to try and approach a bear or wild buck to get a selfie with them. Realistically, we know it happens because such pictures are in fact posted on social media, and these signs were made for a reason. I don\u2019t actually want someone to get hurt, but I\u2019m grumpy right now and want this hike to end. I\u2019m only here to support my friend, and I\u2019m cold and hungry.\n       My friend looks back at me, and I smile and wave. I don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings, after all. They are trying to \u201cfind\u201d themselves, and as part of this quest, they need to experience nature. I believe the phrase they use is \u201ccommune with nature.\u201d Apparently, they can\u2019t do this alone. I really feel their project of finding themselves would work out better if they spent a few hours alone in front of a candle, but they didn\u2019t ask me and I don\u2019t volunteer my opinion. \n       Oh. My. God! This is the biggest flying bug I have ever seen. I\u2019ve seen flying cockroaches in New York City. I thought nothing could be bigger than that. Sadly, I was mistaken. It\u2019s flying right at me, I try to dodge it, but it hits my arm. NOOOOOOO! It\u2019s stuck to my sleeve! I try to shake it off. It won\u2019t budge.               This thing has large fluttering wings that obscures my view of the rest of it. There is nothing left for me to do but slam my arm against a tree and hope I don\u2019t break it. At this point, a broken arm seems better than getting bit from whatever this huge monstrosity is on my arm. \n       Where is my friend?! I\u2019m literally screaming and running toward a tree to save myself from the Godzilla Bug, and they are nowhere to be found.  Perhaps they are playing Enya too loud and can\u2019t hear me with their headphones on. If I die, this is all on them. I lift my arm to wack it against the tree, and I hear screaming coming from the bug on my arm. I scream too. So heart attack it will be for me today it seems, then the bears can eat me.\n       \u201cPlease don\u2019t squash me, I injured my wing and landed on you,\u201d The Godzilla Bug tells me.\n       Clearly, I must have had a heart attack already and instead of my life flashing before me, I hear the bug that caused my death speaking to me. This is what comes from waking up before seven in the morning to help your friend find themselves via immersion in nature. I wish more than anything that my friend would hurry up and find themselves so that we can go to lunch, in a restaurant far away from this hellscape. \n       The Godzilla Bug speaks again, \u201cI\u2019m really speaking to you, lady.\u201d I mean, of course they would say this. \u201cLady, look down at your arm already.\u201d\n       Obviously looking at Godzilla Bug is the last thing I want to do. However, here I am in this situation, and I really seem to have no choice about this. Perhaps if I look down at Bugzilla, they will be happy and fly away.  I look down and see a tiny person with wings. They actually look like a little elf with wings. Their clothes appear to be made from leaves. I\u2019m really sure I\u2019ve hit my head or something because reality has taken a turn for the surreal. \n       Bugzilla speaks again, \u201cI\u2019m a fairy. Fairies live in these woods. We stay hidden from humans. I injured my wing and crashed into you. Since you have been nice enough not to squish me on the tree, and if you would be willing to walk me off the path and set me down in a safe place, I\u2019ll give you any wish you want. That\u2019s the deal. Let\u2019s be quick about this before anyone else comes around. Let\u2019s be clear, I\u2019m only granting this wish because you spared my life and I need your help getting somewhere safe.\u201d \n        \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll drop you off wherever you want me to. Just give me some directions, and please no place where I might get eaten by wildlife, I said.\n        This day did not turn out as I expected to say the least. I\u2019m talking to a magical creature who I didn\u2019t think existed. I\u2019m still not sure that I\u2019m not hallucinating or something. But whatever, I\u2019ll go with this and take Bugzilla to a safe spot.\n        The fairy, also known as Bugzilla to me, gives me instructions. I take them off the path and set them on a little rock. Apparently, once I leave, they will be able to get a message to other fairies to help them. They just need to be out of the way so that other people don\u2019t see them.\n        \u201cSo, what\u2019s your wish? The usual restrictions apply, I can\u2019t bring people back from the dead, influence emotions, extend life, engage in time travel, or grant a wish like giving you lots of money that would be noticeable to other people,\u201d said the fairy. \n        \u201cI know you can\u2019t influence emotions, but could you make it so that my friend stumbles upon a yoga brochure that says, find yourself with our yoga class? Because they are totally the type of person that if they see that, they\u2019ll want to do it, and then we can end this wretched hike and get lunch.\u201d After all, I think to myself, people do not get eaten in yoga classes or encounter a Bugzilla that is actually a fairy causing them to question their sanity.\n        \u201cYour wish is granted. Please don\u2019t mention this to other people. It\u2019s important to us to remain hidden,\u201d said the fairy. \n       I thank them, and assure them that I will never mention this to anyone.  Seriously, people will just think I\u2019m crazy, and I\u2019m still not sure that something isn\u2019t cognitively wrong with me at the moment. I make my way back to the path. After a few moments, I see my friend rushing around the bend waving a yoga class brochure. \n        \u201cHey, I was right about this walk being exactly what I need to find myself. Check out this brochure for a yoga class that I found on the ground. It\u2019s just what I need! You\u2019re going to sign up with me, right?\" Said my friend.\n        \u201cAbsolutely!

Johnny, as he was known by his school friends, was normally very chatty, but not today. He had already taken a sound scolding from Dr. Smirk for his nonexistent flossing habits and was nervously waiting for yet another lecture on his poor brushing techniques. \n        Dr. Smirk was fully prepared to berate young Johnny on the dangers of poor dental hygiene, but then he thought he would perhaps let it slide this time around. Dr. Smirk was in a very good mood. After all, he was coming up on the end of the fiscal year and had record numbers at his practice. He had just bought his wife Sonja Smirk a luxurious convertible for her forty-first birthday, and his son Will Smirk had a brand-new roadster bike wrapped up under the Christmas tree at home waiting for him.\n        If only Dr. Smirk\u2019s mother, Dr. Daniella Hurt, could have lived long enough to see her son operate such a successful dental practice. She had been a pioneer in dental research, developing new implantation techniques still used today. But Dr. Smirk always felt that his mother looked down on him, viewing his dentistry clinic as small potatoes compared to the exciting world of orthotic implantation innovation. Now, however, with three new Smirk Smiles Dentistry Clinics set to open across the city, there could be no doubt that Dr. Smirk had created a financially lucrative business model.\n        Suddenly, the calendar alarm on his phone began to ring and vibrate. The buzz caused him to jump a little, jerking his instrument slightly in Johnny\u2019s mouth.\n        \u201cEhhhh!! Eeee Aeeeuuuulll!\"\" Johnny said this with his mouth wide open.\n        \u201cYes, very good, Johnny. I have to go. My assistant Jackie will finish up with you.\u201d Dr. Smirk snapped his fingers at the front desk as he glanced up at the large, imported Murano clock he had just purchased for the waiting room. It was 2:30 p.m. She was right on time.\n        As Jackie went to Johnny to complete his cleaning, Dr. Smirk walked down the back hallway and out the fire exit door. He stepped into a narrow alley in between his office building and the Mexican restaurant next door. There she was, as she had been on the first Friday of every month for the past two years: the tooth fairy.\n        She stood around twelve inches tall, or at least she would have in her heyday. Dr. Smirk did not understand the aging process for fairies, but this one looked very much post-menopausal. She stooped slightly, her skin pale and hanging loosely on her bones. She had two sets of iridescent and translucent wings protruding from her back.  She was overly thin and had long fingers with even longer fake fingernails painted in silver polish. Her hair was pulled up into a loose and messy bun on the top of her head, and she wore what appeared to be an ill-fitting velour tracksuit. The skin on her face sagged, but she still had very large and beautiful blue eyes, though they narrowed slightly at the sight of Dr. Smirk\u2019s empty hands.\n        She lit up a cigarette and took a long drag, creating lines that puckered around her lips. \u201cYou got the money?\u201d she said before coughing up a puff of glitter.\n        \u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019s right here,\u201d said Dr. Smirk. \u201cYou know smoking is terrible for your teeth.\u201d \n        The tooth fairy gave Dr. Smirk a look as she held out her hand. Dr. Smirk reached into his back pocket and pulled out a wad of cash. He handed it to the fairy and watched her count out the bills twice before pulling out her wand from her tracksuit pocket. The wand was a few inches long, which was just the right size for the tooth fairy, and sported a silver handle with a gold tooth on one end. The tooth had a dent in it. \n        Last month, when Dr. Smirk lightheartedly asked the fairy if she had dented her wand in a fight, he thought she would just laugh. Instead, she whispered low and softly, \u201cWho blabbed?\u201d This disturbed Dr. Smirk more than a little. \n        After the counting was done, the tooth fairy waved the wand in a careful pattern, and suddenly a large burlap sack fell out of nowhere onto the ground. Dr. Smirk reached down and opened the bag. Every time he did this, he felt so dirty when he exchanged the money, but so elated when he saw the teeth.\n        They were beautiful. Human teeth, clean and pristine, in every shape, size and whiteness variation. Dr. Smirk had not bought a single cadaver tooth for his implants in over two years. Instead, he had been purchasing bags of the most gorgeous teeth on earth from the tooth fairy at rock-bottom prices. Then, when everyone left the office in the evenings, he would go into the cosmetics lab and begin the work his late mother had perfected by quickly and efficiently creating perfect teeth implants. He made sure to only do this once a month, and then to correct the books before he left so that no one suspected such a shady crime had ever taken place. Dr. Smirk assumed that purchasing unregulated teeth from a down-and-out, chain-smoking fairy in a back alley and then selling them to his patients as high quality medical implants was a sure fire way to lose one\u2019s medical license. \n        Dr. Smirk squatted down and sifted through the teeth with his hands. \u201cYou have a great haul this month.\u201d \n        \u201cYeah, ever since that new sugar-glazed hamburger was released by Macdoogles, people are losing teeth right and left.\u201d The tooth fairy said, tapping out the ash of her cigarette on the edge of her nail. \n        \u201cSo I know it's not any of my business, Mrs. Tooth Fairy, but... is this something you do often?\u201d Dr. Smirk said.\n        \u201cYou mean hang out with dentists in back alleys? Not on the weekdays. No.\u201d \n        Dr. Smirk decided he did not want to know any more details about that \u201cnot on the weekdays\u201d comment, but he did wonder why the tooth fairy suddenly needed an influx of cash.\n        I know, you are probably wondering what an old fairy like me needs with all these Benjamins. Am I right?\n        Dr. Smirk nodded.\n        The tooth fairy took a final drag on her cigarette and casually snubbed it out under her right sparkly sneaker. She then sharply pinched the bridge of her nose, as if warding off a headache, and sighed. \u201cMy 401k has not been doing well lately, and I already lost a lot of my investment money with the release of that newfangled energy drink \u201cRockitome\u201d back in 2003. I had really hoped it would squeak past the FDA, but at seventy-two grams of sugar per can, I guess even they couldn\u2019t look away. So the whole company just tanked along with my shares. I was hoping to retire early, but that was a pipe dream. Now I just want to retire. Period. Plus, I have never had much of a salary to speak of.\u201d\n        \"\"Well, that seems pretty ridiculous,\u201d Dr. Smirk replied. \u201cThere is only one tooth fairy, after all.\u201d\n        \u201cYes, and there is only one Mythical Creatures\u2019 Union. We decide as a group when to raise salaries and how much to raise them. And Jolly Old Saint Nick has been ruling the board with a big red fist for years. I thought things would get better when we merged with the Goblin\u2019s Guild. I even had some very constructive conversations about pay raises with a few of their members after they joined. But within a week, Santa Claus had negotiated a backroom deal on reindeer leases for their mines, and they fell in line just like the Easter Bunny did before them.\u201d \n        \u201cWow. Being a magical creature sounds pretty complicated.\u201d Dr. Smirk said.\n        \u201cYeah, well, this sale will fortunately be my last,\u201d the tooth fairy replied as she counted out her money one last time before stuffing the wad of cash into her bra. \u201cWith this deal done, I can finally retire.\u201d\n        Dr. Smirk felt a bit of panic. How was he supposed to keep up with his customers' demand for inexpensive and high-quality dental implants?\n        \u201cSo what am I going to do now?\u201d Dr. Smirk said, throwing his hands in the air.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem anymore. But I did hear that Santa Claus has a candy cane surplus this season. Maybe a few extra canes in stockings would throw some extra cavities your way? You\u2019d have to take that up with him. Plus, he should be nominating a new tooth fairy to start work in the new year. Maybe she will be looking for a little side hustle? Keep it flossy, Dr. Smirk.\u201d\n        The tooth fairy gave a wink of her false lashes and a wave of her long fingernails. She turned her little sneakers in a sharp motion on the alleyway pavement and took off in a lumbering jog. Then, she flapped her wings and flew into the cold December air. Dr. Smirk could just make out the words \u201cToothy Couture\u201d on the back of her pants before she disappeared out of sight.\n\""}

Santa was dangling upside down in the middle of Joey\u2019s living room. Joey had set up a classic snare trap next to the cookie plate. Santa had stepped right into it.\n        \u201cHo, ho. Oh,\u201d Santa said. \u201cJoey. Put me down and we can talk.\u201d His upside down belly was uncomfortably jiggling like jelly.\n        \u201cFirst, I need you to make me a deal,\u201d Joey piped up with a commanding tone. He whistled a bit when he said the \u201cs\u201d in promise because he was missing both of his front teeth.\n        \u201cWhat deal?\u201d Santa asked. His rosy cheeks were turning rosier by the second.\n        \u201cI need you to promise to bring my dad back, and then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d Joey gave the rope a tug and a candy cane fell out of Santa\u2019s pocket.\n        \u201cWhat do you mean, Joey?\u201d Santa asked warmly. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t try to trick me, Santa. I know you have him,\u201d Joey declared with conviction.\n        \u201cWhy do you think I have your dad, Joey?\u201d Santa asked as he tried to kick his boot out of the rope.\n        \u201cMy dad is on an arctic expedition. He is an explorer, the greatest explorer in the world. He left on a journey to the North Pole two whole years ago. He promised me he\u2019d be home by Christmas, but last Christmas morning, Grandma and I came downstairs and there was no Dad.\u201d Joey\u2019s confident voice began to falter a bit. \n        He cleared his throat and began again, \u201cBut I know that he made it to the North Pole, because my stockings were full of these.\u201d Joey pulled a slightly sticky pile of postcards out of his pajama pocket. All had pictures of bright, snowy terrains. One had an image of a polar bear in a top hat. Another had a reindeer prancing through a frozen tundra, gracefully kicking up its hind legs. Joey handed the pile to the upside down Santa. The old man\u2019s face softened as he looked at the vivid pictures of winter wonderlands.\n        \u201cJoey, let me down, and I\u2019ll try to help you find your dad,\u201d Santa said. Joey was surprised to hear that Santa\u2019s voice sounded sad. The tone caught the boy a bit off guard. However, he maintained his resolve and held tight to the rope.\n        \u201cWhere is he? I know you know, Santa!\u201d Joey shook the rope again. This time, a jingle bell tumbled to the ground with a musical clang.\n        Santa sighed, then he gave a little wink and touched his nose. Just as suddenly as he had appeared in Joey\u2019s living room minutes ago, Santa vanished out of the ropes and reappeared, sitting comfortably and upright on the couch in front of the fireplace. Joey let out a little gasp of astonishment, and then his face fell as he looked at the now limp rope in his hand. The boy knew he had lost his leverage and was dealing with forces out of his control. Santa was smiling and softly \u201cho, ho-ing\u201d to himself on the couch. Then, he said, \u201cJoey, come here.\u201d He tapped the cushion next to him.\n        Hesitantly, Joey walked over and sat next to the plump old man.\n        \u201cMy dad told me that he has been to the North Pole. Look. It is right here!\u201d Joey handed Santa another postcard, this one featuring a candy cane striped pole standing up straight in the snow.\n        Santa looked at the picture and smiled gently at Joey.\n        \u201cJoey, I\u2019ve never met your dad. The North Pole that I am from doesn\u2019t look like that,\u201d he said, tapping the photo on the postcard. \u201cIt looks like this.\u201d As he said the word \u201cthis\u201d the image on the postcard transformed and revealed a beautiful, vivid image of a little, snow-covered village. Joey looked at it with awe and then jumped a bit when the images started moving. He could see snow falling in the sky and tiny little people wearing bright colors walking around in the streets, holding beautifully wrapped packages.\n        \u201cYour dad isn\u2019t here in this North Pole, or at least not in the North Pole of my\u2026 how shall I put it? Ho, ho. Hmm. Dimension, perhaps. My North Pole isn\u2019t in this same dimension. It isn\u2019t a place that a human explorer can get to,\u201d Santa gently explained this as the image of his village faded and the striped pole reappeared on Joey\u2019s postcard.\n        \u201cBut maybe I can help you find him. Let\u2019s see.\u201d Santa pulled a little red and green notebook out of his jacket and began to examine it.\n        \u201cOh yes. Right here. Joseph Jones of the escapist dimension. Yes, yes. Oh, I see,\u201d Santa muttered to himself. Joey looked at the notebook in wonder as bizarre and beautiful shapes and figures appeared on the pages. They looked as if they were being written in a golden, sparkling ink by some invisible hand. He had no idea what they meant, but Santa seemed able to easily decipher these magically appearing figures.\n        \u201cEscapist dimension? What is that? Where is it?\u201d Joey asked, excitement rising in his voice.\n        \u201cWell, Joey, this might be a bit challenging to explain, but you look like a sharp young man, so let me give it a try. You see, I don\u2019t really exist in this dimension. Or, dimension might be the wrong word to use here. Oh my. Ho. Ho. This is quite the challenge. I haven\u2019t had to explain in years. Well, I am from another place where time and space works differently than it does here. It was created hundreds of years ago by children like you, who believed in the place so much that it actually became real. Ho, ho! Imagine it. A figment of imagination was shared by so many young minds for so long, that a real new imaginary dimension was created. I can travel between your dimension and mine. All I have to do is follow the energy created by the shared imagination of children. Does this make sense?\u201d \n        Joey looked at Santa and lowered one eyebrow. Of course, it didn\u2019t make any sense. But Joey wasn\u2019t about to admit his confusion to Santa, so he just nodded his head.\n        Santa took a sugarplum from his other pocket and began taking licks of it as he said, \u201cIt looks like this place that your dad sends these letters from is also another dimension. A lot of people end up getting stuck there. You see, it looks like your dad is a true believer. When most children grow up, they stop believing in Santa. But not your dad. Your dad never stopped believing. He must have believed for so long and so hard that he slipped into a totally new dimension, one only he can ever really access or understand. His imagination was so strong that it created a whole new world. The only problem is that it looks like he might have gotten stuck in it. Oh, ho, ho, no. I must tell you, Joey. Traveling through dimensions can be very tricky business. Very tricky indeed.\u201d\n        \u201cIf he is stuck in a different dimension, how can I bring him back?\u201d Joey asked, desperation spilling into his pitch.\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Santa said matter-of-factly. Tears spring to Joey\u2019s eyes. This was what he had feared.\n        \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d Joey asked, voice quivering.\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t bring him back, but, if I teach you, I might be able to help you visit him.\u201d When Santa said this, little bubbles of hope began to fizz up in Joey\u2019s heart.\n        \u201cPlease teach me!\u201d Joey said. He could hardly contain his excitement.\n        \u201cOkay, Joey,\u201d Santa said, \"Let's make a deal. If you let me down, we can start.\u201d"}

The smell of sulfur had steadily intensified as the metal box pierced through the crust of the earth. The heat had climbed as well, to the point where the metal box felt like a personal sauna. A guttural growling that was still somehow soft came over the speakers. \n        \u201cFloor 666, Department of Faustian Bargains and Lawyer Support Center,\u201d it said.\n        Rachel stepped through the elevator doors and into the massive hall beyond. It was a grand, opulent place covered in gold, obsidian, and crimson. Statues of horned figures with wide-stretched bat wings flanked the red carpet that led to an ornate set of golden doors.\n        Taking a settling breath, Rachel strode across the carpet. With every step, they felt like the statues at either side would come to life, grab them, and then unfortunate things would follow. But the statues remained inanimate. Except for one which Rachel could\u2019ve sworn blinked, but they did their best to not think about that.\n        The doors at the end of the hall were engraved with scenes of deals being made. Mortals walked to the hulking figures of demons, knelt in supplication, and are given their wildest dreams. The story didn\u2019t end there, however. On the lower half of the door were carvings of those who failed to uphold their end of the bargain. The consequences were dire. Boiling oil, pits of fire, eternal damnation stuff. It was a sight intended to intimidate those who came to the bargaining table in bad faith. However, the underlying message was clear to Rachel. The only ones needing to be cautious were the mortals. The only faith a demon knew was bad faith.\n        Rachel moved to push the doors open, but just before they could touch the surface, a figure appeared next to them in a jet of flame. It was a demon, a male one, wearing the sharpest suit Rachel had ever seen in their life. His wings were neatly folded behind him, his pointed tail wrapped around his waist like a belt, and his horns were curved in a way that accentuated his face rather than dominated it. All in all, he was doing his best to appear as human as possible. Rachel took note of that. \n        \u201cGreetings and salutations, Wanderer of the Underworld. You have found yourself in the great pit, the horrendous nightmare domain of those who seek gains beyond what their mortal life allows them. I am Malkazenlok. Do you have a meeting scheduled?\u201d the demon said in a monotone voice.\n        Looking at Malkazenlok\u2019s face, Rachel realized that he had his eyes fixed on his own hands. Glancing down, Rachel saw that Malkazenlok was poorly covering a set of notecards that was subtly flipping through. Unprofessional.\n        Rachel cleared their throat and spoke in their best nervous tone. \u201cYes. I am Rachel. I\u2019m here for an appointment with the great and powerful Daglaktok that was scheduled on my 25th birthday for my 26th. That day has arrived.\u201d\n        \u201cOne moment,\u201d Malkazenlok said.\n        Malkazenlok raised a single claw and poked at the air. A fiery rectangle scrawled itself in the space before him. Runes and glyphs appeared inside the rectangle. Malkazenlok swiped his finger at the symbols, which scrolled accordingly, much like they would on a modern tablet. After reading a moment, Malkazenlok brushed his hand through the fiery construct. \n        \u201cIt seems that you speak truthfully. Very well. You may enter the domain of The Deal Brokers. May you find what you seek in this place,\u201d Malkazenlok said. \n        Rachel waited for the doors to open. Nothing happened. \n        \u201cUh\u2026 aren\u2019t you going to let me in?\u201d they asked.\n        Malkazenlok looked up, surprised by another fiery rectangle they had conjured over to the side. \n        \u201cOh, right. I forgot. We don\u2019t have the budget to open those anymore. We do this now. Much more efficient,\u201d he said. \n        Rachel almost had the opportunity to ask \u201cDo what?\u201d but before they could, Malkazenlok snapped his fingers. In a flash, a shot of flame crawled up Rachel\u2019s body, consuming them. When the flames subsided, Rachel found that they had been transported into a seat at a table. The table sat in the middle of a spotlight, with nothing but impenetrable darkness around it. \n        Before Rachel could get their bearings, another gout of flame heralded the arrival of a demon. Stepping through the shadowy fire was\u2026 Malkazenlok.\n        \u201cOh. I thought you were just the doorman,\u201d Rachel said.\n        Malkazenlok gave a long-suffering sigh and sat down at the other end of the table. \n        \u201cYes, I am. I am also the primary liaison for initial hearings with mortals. I am also the second-in-command of the Department of Faustian bargains, the intern, the janitor, the electrician, as well as every other role that could possibly need filling in this place,\u201d Malkazenlok said.\n        \u201cWhat about the lawyer support center?\u201d Rachel asked.\n        \u201cClosed for a decade. But we\u2019re killing time. I\u2019ve got important business elsewhere. Several fires need putting out, while several others need relighting. It happens when you work in Hell. Let us get down to business. For what purpose do you seek to make a deal with Hell?\u201d Malkazenlok asked. \n        \u201cActually, I\u2019m not here to make a deal,\u201d Rachel said. \n        Malkazenlok rolled his eyes and put his head in his hands. \n        \u201cOh great. Let me guess. Another missionary? I appreciate the attempts, but it\u2019s mortals you have to save, not us. Now if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m quite busy, so if you have no further business\u2026\u201d Malkazenlok said.\n        Rachel stood from the table and stretched. Something about their manner had changed. Malkazenlok felt their presence reverberate through the room like a struck bell.\n        \u201cLet me ask you something. Where are all the other demons? Especially, your bosses,\u201d Rachel asked. \n        \u201cThey\u2026 they were all laid off. My bosses have reworked the budget to funnel all extraneous funds directly into their accounts, while leaving me to pick up the work. I believe they\u2019re on vacation at some beach resort at the moment,\u201d Malkazenlok said. \n        Now it was Rachel\u2019s turn to sigh. \u201cI should\u2019ve known. There hasn\u2019t been a budget change down here in the last millennium. We really should make these routine inspections more frequent,\u201d they said. \n        Malkazenlok shrunk back in his chair. \u201cWho are you, really?\u201d \n        Rachel looked down at the demon cowering before them. With a slight smile, they brushed their hand through their hair. As their hand left their hair, a pinpoint of pure black appeared around their head. Continuing the movement of their hand, the blackness stretched and grew in a circle, until it formed a dark halo above Rachel\u2019s head. Two large black wings coalesced from shadows onto their back, then stretched wide as though they hadn\u2019t been used in quite some time. A clipboard also appeared out of shadow and fell into their hands.\n        \u201cI am Rachel, as I said. Fallen angel and inspection officer for this layer of Hell,\u201d they said. \n        Malkazenlok was terrified.\n        \u201cPlease, oh great fallen one, allow me to keep my position! My bosses are the ones that have betrayed you!\u201d He cried. \n        Rachel rapidly jotted down notes on their clipboard. \u201cOh, there will be consequences, you can believe that. But first, I believe we should make this official,\u201d they said. \n        Rachel slid the clipboard across the table to face Malkazenlok. On it was written a contract.\n        \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. You tell me where your bosses are, and you get to be head of this department. You\u2019ve already been running the place as it is. This deal will just be appropriately accommodating you for your work,\u201d Rachel said. \n        Malkazenlok scanned the contract. Everything seemed to be in order. Even the mono-molecular fine print was written in his favor.\n        \u201cWhy do this for me? Fallen are supposed to be ruthless, not merciful,\u201d said Malkazenlok. \n        Rachel laughed. It was like the shivering of stars.\n        \u201cThis might be Hell, but we still have standards. I am unforgiving, ruthless, and merciless, but you require no mercy. You have done nothing wrong. Your bosses have. They will be treated accordingly. Now, do we have a deal?\u201d"}

The orange shag carpet was marked with cigarette burns under Cal\u2019s chair. His studio setup was surprisingly simple for a radio broadcast with millions of listeners.\n\tTchotchkes, mostly sent in from listeners, lined the shelves next to his desk. A shadow box containing rocks and small chunks of metal that Cal smuggled from the Roswell crash site was showcased on the top shelf. One shelf was filled with \u201chaunted\u201d dolls he had accumulated over the years.

So, I went to ValueMart and got a black candle and a skull. It was close to Halloween, so they had that stuff. I couldn\u2019t find a real skull, so I had to get a plastic one. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s legal to have a real skull.\u201d\n\t\u201cGot it, plastic skull. So where does the Devil stuff come in?\u201d he asked. \n\t\u201cWell, I set up the candle on top of the skull and, ya know, made up a spell. Real formal like. I lit the candle, and it melted, like, superfast. It wasn\u2019t real steady on the skull, so it fell, and ya know, set the table on fire. It was a pretty small fire, so I was able to get it out and all, but yeah.\u201d Matt took a breath.\n\t\u201cDabbling in a little black magic, eh? You were literally and figuratively playing with fire.\u201d Cal laughed at his own joke. \u201cDid you at least get the girl?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, sir. Not yet. I was asking the devil to give me the power to fly. Ya know, to impress her. I mean, I haven\u2019t been able to do it yet, but I\u2019ve had a lot of bad luck. Is there any way to reverse it? The deal. Like, get my soul or\u2026\u201d Matt trailed off.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. The Devil doesn\u2019t give refunds. All sales are final. How old are you, Matt?\u201d\n\t\u201cNineteen,\u201d he answered. \n\t\u201cWell, I suppose you should make the most of the next\u2026 what...fifty or sixty years.\u201d Cal snickered, \u201cBefore, well, you know.\u201d Cal checked the clock. \u201cLooks like we are out of time. Join us tomorrow night when our guests will be a former CIA agent that can prove that birds are drones, and a couple that raises chupacabras. Until next time, beware of the things that go bump in the night.\u201d\n\tCal clicked off his microphone. \u201cSuckers,\u201d he said under his breath.\n\tThe shadow of an imposing figure sauntered past the window. It stomped up the porch steps, and flung open the door. A stunning, dark haired man, dressed in a black suit, swaggered in and propped himself against the edge of Cal\u2019s desk.\n\tCal looked the man in his deep red eyes, \u201cAre we settled up?\u201d\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s take a look-see,\u201d the man said, pulling a piece of paper out of the inside pocket of his suit jacket. \u201cYou\u2019ve already secured eleven souls, which means you still owe me two more. And how many did you find for me tonight?\u201d\n\t\u201cI got you three. You even have a bonus soul,\u201d Cal said.\n\t\u201cAnd they all believe they\u2019re condemned for all eternity?\u201d the man asked.\n\t\u201cYou heard it yourself, broadcasted to fifteen million listeners\u201d\n\t\u201cExcellent work!\u201d The man handed Cal the piece of paper. \u201cYou can confirm that this is the contract you signed in your blood, June 16, 1987?\u201d\n\tCal examined the piece of paper and handed it back to the man. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the contract.\u201d\n\t\u201cVery good.\u201d The man held the paper in his hand, and in a red, hot flash, the paper ignited, and ashes rained down on the floor. \u201cNull and void.\u201d\n\tCal sighed in relief. \n\tThe man brushed a stray ember off his sleeve. \u201cIt was a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. DeVille. If you\u2019re ever tempted to expand that fame, you know where to reach me.\u201d With that, he strolled out the door. \n\tCal covered his face with his hands. He laughed as tears of joy streamed down his face. He wiped his eyes with his shirt sleeve. Once he had collected himself, he walked to the open door. A shiver ran down his spine as the man disappeared into a smokey fog, off to collect his new souls. \n"}

The story should be about 1800 words.","targets":"        Thomas pushed the cart through a dark and dusty aisle of Hectares Of Books, his boat shoes sticking to the cold concrete floor from the Dr. Pepper he\u2019d spilled on them earlier. He had twenty-seven dollars to his name and no one to drink a beer with after work.\n        What am I doing with my life?\n        He had started in the Fiction Hall that morning and gotten through Aisle Ja\u2014Kl before lunch. For the last year, it had been his daily morning routine to scan the shelves for books that patrons had put back in the wrong place. \n        He stopped and rolled his eyes, pulling a book from the shelf to his left. Was it so hard to know the difference between Ludlum and Vonnegut?\n        He had the job because the owner noticed he spent most of his time there anyway. Heck, he had been reshelving books and discarding broken spines since high school, six years ago. He could walk down every aisle in the bookstore, more than fifty aisles in four different anterooms with bookshelves ten feet high\u2014soulless, windowless, chambers\u2014and pick a misplaced book out just by walking by.\n        He stopped and grimaced. Here is L. Ron Hubbard on a shelf next to romance novels with pictures of Fabio. What were people thinking? He pulled the book from the shelf and put it in the cart.\n        A word popped into Thomas\u2019s head. Coddiwomple. To travel purposefully toward an as-yet-unknown destination. Thomas smiled. That\u2019s me, traveling through the bookstore stacks.\n        Mr. Whipple stopped at the end of Kl\u2014Le, looking his way. God, why did he have to have a name like that? The old man was like a cross between Tyler Durden and the professor from The Paper Chase. The cunning demeanor and the smooth English accent, rolled into an ancient bookstore owner.\n        \u201cMr. Anderson, the front staff have culled the latest donations. Many of them are not salesworthy.\u201d \n        Thomas shivered. \n        Mr. Whipple made a sniffing sound. \u201cThey are in a rolling bin next to the restrooms. You have a bin of broken books as well, correct?\u201d\n        Thomas nodded. \n        \u201cThey need to be taken to the recycling dumpster in the alley,\u201d Mr. Whipple said, approaching him. \u201cDo you think you can manage both carts, Mr. Anderson?\u201d  \n        Thomas cleared his throat. \u201cCan I do that after lunch, Mr. Whipple?\u201d\n        \u201cOf course, Thomas.\u201d Mr. Whipple gave him a sad smile before turning around. He stopped to look back at Thomas at the end of the aisle, licked his lips, then disappeared.\n        Thomas let out a breath, and pushed the cart forward.\n        After lunch, Thomas pushed his collection of books with torn or missing covers, broken spines, and missing pages to the rear fire door, and shoved it into the afternoon sun with a bang, dragging the donation bin behind him. At the recycling dumpster, he threw back the heavy lid, reached into the donation bin, and tossed an armful of books over the edge. After clearing the donations, he moved on to his discarded bin. About halfway down, he saw a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Thomas picked it up.\n        I don\u2019t recall seeing this one before. \n        Shrugging, Thomas started to toss the book into the dumpster.\n        \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that!\u201d\n        Startled, Thomas dropped the book and turned around. Seeing no one in the alley, he called out. \u201cWho said that?\u201d\n        \u201cI did, you nincompoop.\u201d \n        Thomas looked around, then behind the dumpster. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d\n        \u201cNo joke, nincompoop!\u201d\n        Thomas\u2019 eyes fell on the book on the ground. His eyes wide.\n        \u201cIt is I, or it is me, in the flesh! Or the pulp, as it were.\u201d The cover pulsed with a bluish glow in sync with the words emanating from it.\n        Thomas reached toward the book. \u201cCan I pick you up?\u201d\n        \u201cOf course. Just because I\u2019m fabulous doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n        Thomas picked up the book and tried to open it.\n        \u201cCareful! I am not for reading. The quantum entanglement on my insides would astound you and confound your reality.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n        \u201cI am a supernatural, interdimensional superior being.\u201d\n        Thomas turned the book over, then back to the cover.        \n        \u201cWhy are you a book?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, I can be a square.\u201d In Thomas\u2019 hands, the book transformed into a radiating square. \u201cOr a sphere.\u201d Then its shape changed into a shimmering sphere of the same size. Thomas jerked his hands up and the sphere floated to the ground.\n        \u201cCareful, nincompoop!\u201d\n        \u201cYou felt cold.\u201d\n        \u201cBetter than hot, nincompoop! I could be a record.\u201d The sphere transformed into the Nirvana album NeverMind. \u201cPick me up!\u201d\n        Thomas held the record gingerly in his hands. \u201cYou can be a record? Do you play?\u201d\n        The record vibrated and shimmered. \u201cPssssh. Do I play? Of course! The best album of all time would deserve nothing less!\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know about the best album,\u201d Thomas said. \n        The record morphed back into the original book.\n        \u201cDo you know music, nincompoop?\u201d\n        \u201cNo, and my name is Thomas. I just don\u2019t think Nirvana has the best music.\u201d\n        The book sighed. \u201cWell, Thomas, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, maybe you should just keep it to yourself. Okay?\u201d\n        What the hell? \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n        \u201cMy name? My name. Hm, I haven\u2019t ever thought about that.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat do you mean? How old are you?\u201d\n        \u201cI have been on this planet for half a million years.\u201d\n        Thomas looked around. \u201cHalf a million. Get out of here. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n        \u201cHalf a million, give or take a millennium.\u201d\n        Thomas' eyes narrowed. \"Are you immortal?\"\n        The book glowed. \"Immortality is but ubiquity in time.\"\n        \u201cSo you\u2019ve seen everything.\u201d\n        \u201cYou bet.\u201d\n        \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a name.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, no. Good point. I haven\u2019t had anyone to talk to.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m the first person you\u2019ve ever talked to?\u201d\n        \u201cHuh. Well, I guess so.\u201d The book hummed.\n        \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n        \u201cAren\u2019t you an interdimensional supernatural superior being?\u201d\n        \u201cLook, nincompoop. Don\u2019t get too smart for a hairless monkey.\u201d\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t have always been a book.\u201d\n        \u201cNo, I spent most of my time as a rock. Moving from place to place.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been a book for very long.\u201d\n        \u201cNo. Things were just starting to get interesting.\u201d\n        \u201cHow long have you been a book?\u201d\n        \u201cAbout a hundred and fifty years.\u201d\n        \u201cThen you weren\u2019t always the Hitchhiker's Guide.\u201d\n        \u201cOh no. When I started out as a book, I started out as Anna Karenina. Let me tell you, Count Vronsky is such a dude.\u201d\n        Thomas rolled his eyes. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, that\u2019s a complicated question.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n        The book sighed. \u201cYes, but do you understand the origin of the universe, dark matter, and black holes?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, a little,\u201d Thomas said, scratching his head.\n        \u201cLet\u2019s just say the gravitational wave signals you think you perceive are the secondary emissions from an intelligence occupying a higher plane of existence. Black holes are emitters of dark energy used by that intelligence. They are also revolving doors to other parts of the universe. I came to this planet through one of those black holes.\u201d\n        \u201cI meant, how did you get to this bookstore?\u201d\n        \u201cOh, someone had purchased me as a first edition of Ayn Rand\u2019s The Fountainhead, and then put me in a crate. When that hairless monkey died, I changed my title. The greedy progeny brought me here.\u201d\n        \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone back home in half a million years?\u201d\n        \u201cIf I could, don't you think I would have, nincompoop?\u201d\n        \u201cStop calling me that. What should I call you? Zaphod?\u201d\n        The book let out a choking sound. \u201cOhhh, don\u2019t you dare. I like Buckaroo.\u201d\n        \u201cBuckaroo?\u201d\n        \u201cFor Buckaroo Banzai, you hairless monkey. You know the movie, right?\u201d\n        \u201cI know it. I\u2019m just surprised you do.\u201d\n        \u201cBuckaroo Banzai in the eighth dimension! Of course, there are just a few more dimensions than that. But it\u2019s still a good film.\u201d\n        \u201cHow do you know about movies?\u201d\n        \u201cI spent decades in libraries with multimedia rooms.\u201d\n        \u201cThat's why you're a book?\u201d\n        \u201cHairless monkeys are stupid, but they can be very entertaining.\u201d\n        The fire door slammed open, and Mr. Whipple stood there.\n        \u201cMr. Anderson, do you think you might finish your chore any time soon?\u201d\n        Thomas looked at the book in his hand. \u201cRight away, Mr. Whipple.\u201d\n        \u201cSee that you don\u2019t delay, Mr. Anderson.\u201d With that, he turned away, and the fire door closed again.\n        \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work,\u201d Thomas said to the book.\n        \u201cTell him to go pound sand. Don\u2019t be a stupid, hairless monkey.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat am I going to do without a job?\u201d Thomas laid the book next to the dumpster and lifted an armful of books from the bin.\n        \u201cI can help you. If you help me.\u201d\n        Thomas lifted another armful of books and threw them into the dumpster.\n        \u201cLook, this is really weird. You\u2019re just a book. What can you do?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, what does the hairless monkey need?\u201d\n        \u201cLook, Zaphod. Why don't you call me Thomas, and I\u2019ll call you Buckaroo?\u201d\n        The book groaned. \u201cFine. Thomas. What do you need?\u201d\n        \u201cI need money, Buckaroo,\u201d said Thomas.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s easy. Pull out your cell phone. You have your bank app on there, right?\u201d\n        \u201cYes,\u201d Thomas said, pulling out his cell phone and opening his banking app. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n        \u201cLogin.\u201d\n        Thomas did so. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n        \u201cNow, how much do you need?\u201d\n        Thomas put his phone down by his side. \u201cWait. First, Buckaroo, what do you need?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, aha. Ha. I just need access to a Hadron collider and something cyou hairless monkeys call element 115.\u201d\n        \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to get those?\u201d\n        \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got a superior supernatural interdimensional being with you. I don\u2019t expect a hairless monkey, or you, Thomas, to know how to do that. I just need help getting there.\u201d\n        Thomas hesitated, then raised his phone and entered the password on the app.\n        \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d\n        \u201cHow much do we need to find a Hadron collider? I don\u2019t know. A million dollars!\u201d\n        \u201cDone, Thomas!\u201d\n        \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n        \u201cLook at your bank app.\u201d\n        Sure enough, when Thomas looked at his account, he had one million, twenty-seven dollars in his account.\n        Whoa. \u201cSo what now?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, now we go tell Uncle Fester that you are quitting. We go and collect your toothbrush, your towel, and your fanny pack, and we leave.\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t have a fanny pack.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, right. All adolescent hairless monkeys without friends have fanny packs.\u201d\n        Thomas raised the book towards the dumpster. \u201cMaybe I should just put you in the recycle bin with the rest of the refuse.\u201d\n        \u201cNo! Just kidding. You don\u2019t need anything. We just leave. Whatever you require, we can buy. What do you say, Thomas?

{"example_id":"example_085","inputs":"Write about making a deal with a supernatural being. The story should be between 1800-1900 words. Amara and Marina are best friends who go to the beach together in the summer. Amara is afraid of the ocean, but Marina helps her wade further into the ocean. Amara has had many failed relationships and recently lost another one, so she is happy to be on vacation with her best friend. Write it so that Marina gets most of the male attention, and goes for a walk on the beach with an engaged man. Amara wakes up and sees Marina is still not back. Amara finds Marina on the beach with water swirling around her. Marina tells Amara she\u2019s actually a nixie (a water spirit that lures men into the water) and she would like Amara to join them. After some hesitation and persuasion, Amara agrees.","targets":"       \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it\u2026\u201d Amara said, standing on the edge of the ocean, squeezing the warm, crumbly sand between her toes. She looked out at the expansive, glowing turquoise sea. Amara knew that there was no telling all the secrets it held, and that\u2019s what scared her the most. It didn\u2019t matter how many marine biologists or deep-sea divers there were out there, the unknown was what stopped her, every summer, from floating in the deep blue.\n        \u201cSure you can, it\u2019s fun! Just take it one step at a time. You swim in pools!\u201d Marina said, throwing her arms up in the air as the slow, wavy water curled and sloshed around her body.\n        \u201cYeah\u2026 I can also see what\u2019s in pools!\u201d\n        \"No, you can\u2019t!

Amara closed her eyes, allowing herself to be led into the ocean. \n        \u201cSee, there you go. Now, do we have to do this on every vacation?\u201d Marina asked.\n        Amara opened her eyes, giving Marina an irritated look. This was the third year in a row that they had gone on a vacation to the beach together. Amara was unsure why she kept going since she had been afraid of the ocean her whole life, but she figured she could swim in pools, enjoy the scenery, and have a couple of drinks at night. This summer, after another) heinous breakup, a vacation felt exceptionally important to Amara. The insufferable ocean was worth it if it meant she got to take a few weeks off work and chill with her best friend, trying to forget the painful months that now laid behind her.\n       The sun started to hide behind the ocean, casting different hues of pink and orange across the sky. Amara and Marina headed back to their beachfront hotel room, their balcony visible from the coast. The sand was much cooler now, a nice contrast to when they first arrived, hop-skipping their way to the water, the tiny rocks burning the balls and heels of their feet. Their matching beach bags (white, with baby-blue stripes) hung at their sides, Marina\u2019s slipping off every once in a while from her soaking, salty shoulder. \n        Their hotel room was quaint and small. The two queen-sized beds were white, with blue headboards and folded blankets on the ends with some computerized print of a swordfish on them. Above the bed hung photos of generic fish of all colors\u2014orange, blue, and yellow - all with mouths opened as if they were singing. In a small corner was a \u201ckitchen\u201d area, which really consisted of a miniscule refrigerator, a microwave, and a coffee pot. Their bathroom was tiny, with a sink, shower tub, and toilet. Every morning, they had to take turns getting ready. Neither one of them was sure why they did their hair and makeup if they were just going to go swimming an hour afterward, ruining the time they spent - but they did, anyway. \n        After they showered, Amara and Marina went down to the hotel restaurant and bar. Amara, never the seafood type, ordered a cheeseburger and a side salad, while Marina feasted on oysters and crab. They both drank Blue Lagoon margaritas, a concoction of alcohol and syrups that they weren\u2019t quite sure of. The bittersweet flavor burned Amara\u2019s chest, causing her to cringe and shiver with each passing drink. Men sauntered by their table, Amara glancing at each one, hoping to gain some attention, or at least, a summer romance. Most of them looked at Amara but then turned their attention to Marina, sometimes stopping to talk or flirt with her. Amara was unsure how Marina did it. \n        \u201cWhat about him?\u201d Marina asked Amara with a sly smile and a laugh.\n        \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s wearing a ring on his finger,\u201d Amara responded.\n        \u201cMaybe,\u201d Marina said, \u201cbut that\u2019s never stopped me before.\u201d She picked up her drink and walked over to the mystery man. \n        Marina had this intoxicating way about her\u2014a mysterious lure that people were drawn to. On the other hand, Amara, whose failed relationships were plentiful, could hardly get anyone to look at her anymore. Marina walked back over to the table quickly.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s engaged,\u201d Marina whispered to Amara. \u201cWe\u2019re going for a quick walk on the beach. Want to join us?\u201d\n        \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, Marina. I\u2019ll just head back to the room. I\u2019m almost done with this, anyway,\u201d Amara responded, holding her drink up and then sipping the last of the bright blue droplets through the straw.\n        Amara fell asleep quickly, her body becoming nearly motionless right when her head hit the pillow.    It wasn\u2019t until 3 a.m. that she was jolted awake by a light banging on the balcony door. She blinked her eyes swiftly, rubbing them nearly raw, and finally got them open enough to look at Marina\u2019s bed. It was dark\u2014it took a minute for her eyes to adjust, but she realized Marina was not there. She shifted under the covers, then pulled them off of her. \n        \u201cMarina?\u201d Amara called out. \u201cMarina?\u201d\n         She sat up and walked over to the sliding glass door, slowly flipping the lock from down to up, and stepped out onto the porch. The wind was forceful and intense, with a heavy current gusting around her. Sand from the beach below blew in her eyes, her hair whipping all over her face and forcing its way into her mouth. Amara coughed and quickly ran back into the hotel room. She flicked all the lights on, and slammed the door to the bathroom open, still calling Marina\u2019s name. Stinging tears started to filter out of Amara\u2019s eyes, scared and worried about her best friend. Amara rushed out of the room and down the stairs, assuming it would be faster than the elevator. \n        The hotel lobby was nearly empty, with only a receptionist behind a desk and a few early-morning arrivals checking in. They noticed Amara, breathing heavily, calling out, \u201cMarina! Marina!\u201d \n       \u201cUhm, sometimes people have a little too much fun at the bar, I guess,\u201d the receptionist said with an awkwardly scared smile. \n        Amara pushed the doors open and made her way outside, her bare feet grating against the sodden, concrete ground. She ran to the beach, her silk shorts nearly hanging off her hips. Once she reached the oceanfront, the sight before her eyes terrified her. \n        Marina was standing on the outskirts of the water, a cyclone swirling around her. There was a crystal-blue glow. She held her arms stiffly, her palms facing out. Amara squinted. \u201cMarina? Is that you? You should come inside, it\u2019s too windy out here. Something is going on.\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t come inside, Amara.\u201d Her voice was trance-like, the words coming out slowly and calmly. Amara, arms crossed and shivering, stepped to Marina\u2019s side. Her eyes were closed, and her body was stiff yet harmonious. Amara reached out to touch Marina\u2019s arm, but before she could, a blue, ghost-like figure appeared before her. Amara squinted her eyes again, trying to make out exactly what this creature was. \n       \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026.you\u2019re Marina?\u201d Amara said, as both a question and a statement. \n        \u201cHello, Amara. I\u2019ve been wondering when you would come to the ocean,\u201d Marina, now a supernatural figure, said. The voice was high-pitched and echoed.\n        \u201cWhat\u2026what are you? Where\u2019s Marina?\u201d\n        \u201cI am Marina.\u201d\n        \u201cBut, Marina is a human!\u201d\n        \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. I, Marina, am a nixie.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d Amara\u2019s hair was still thrashing around, her arms crossed. She could feel the goosebumps welling up on her skin and the hairs on the back of her neck standing up.\n        \u201cA nixie is a water spirit.\u201d Marina shifted around, the water following her every move. \u201cWe would like you to join us here in the ocean, Amara. You can live amongst the other nixies. We find men and lure them in. It\u2019s truly a wonderful life.\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t. I have a job, a home, and a life,\u201d Amara shouted at the top of her lungs.\n        \u201cMaybe you do, but what could be better than spending the rest of your life in the water with your best friend, luring men here one by one? You may have a life back home, but every relationship you\u2019ve had has failed. If you come to live with us, you can have any man - and as many men - as you could possibly want.\u201d \n        \u201cThat sounds terrible!\u201d Amara shouted back. \u201cI do not want to do that. I\u2019m not that desperate!\u201d\n        \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Marina shifted again, and all of a sudden images of Amara and her past relationships came bubbling up. The replay always started out happy: meet, fall in love, laughter, and pet adoptions. Then, it turns dark; there is fighting, screaming, and crying, and eventually, one of them leaves. Amara started crying at the thought of being alone forever. Now that she knew who Marina truly was, she really would be alone, losing her best friend. \n        \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to the beach for three years, Amara. And never once have you wondered or noticed that the men who flirt with me all disappear. They\u2019re here, in the ocean. They\u2019re mine. If you join us, you, too, can be beautiful and alluring and have any man you want.\u201d\n        Amara had tears flowing down her cheeks, the salty drops landing on her lips and chin. \n        \u201cSo if I come into the ocean, you\u2019re telling me I\u2019ll no longer be lonely?\u201d Amara yelled with intense wonderment now, considering the offer.\n        \u201cOf course, and the best part is, you can turn into a human form at any time. Come, join the water spirits. We\u2019ve been waiting for you for three years and have your contract all ready to be signed.\u201d\n        \u201cContract?\u201d \n        \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, Amara. Just an agreement that once you become a water spirit, you\u2019re ours for all time. But the benefits far outweigh any negatives. You are free to roam the ocean, bring in any man you like, and you\u2019ll be with me, forever. Just sign right here, on the line.\u201d Marina held up a contract made out of crushed seashells and rock. Amara, still with tears coming down, couldn\u2019t deny that the life of a nixie sounded alluring and seductive\u2014 two things she had always wanted to be, but never really felt.\n        \u201cO-okay,\u201d she said, taking small steps forward. She could feel the water misting her body more and more. A broken limb of orange coral with ink on the tip appeared before her. Amara grabbed it, her fingers wrapping around the end. She stopped abruptly before signing, considering a negotiation. \n        \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d Marina said. \n        Amara put the rigid coral up to the rock-hard contract and signed her name: Amara Bardot.\n        A rush of water came swirling around her, and she was lifted high into a wave, taken out to sea.\n"}

We were headed up the Royal Arch Trail in the Colorado Flatirons on a crisp fall day.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t we already live there?\u201d I asked, grinning at the back of his head as we walked. He and I grew up together in the same small Colorado town and recently moved to Boulder together for college.         \u201cOr are you talking about moving somewhere more remote?\u201d\n        He shook his head, walking backward to face me as he spoke. \u201cI mean, really living out on the land. Survivalist mode. Hiking from place to place and exploring the wilderness full-time. It\u2019s been my greatest dream ever since I was a kid. That, and see a real-life Sasquatch.\u201d\n        Lee was an avid daydreamer, always a little out of touch with reality. He\u2019d always been obsessed with cryptids, namely Bigfoot, for as long as I\u2019d known him. He was a huge nature lover too, but he didn't know the first thing about surviving in the woods. \n        I laughed. \u201cI never knew that about you. Reminds me of that guy... Christopher McCandless, the Into the Wild guy.\"\n        In the subsequent silence, I felt compelled to clarify his statement. \"Would you really do something like that\u2014 say goodbye to everyone you love just to live in the mountains, all alone?\u201d\n        He turned and grinned at me, lifting his eyebrows. His expression was so sincere, I knew without a doubt he wasn't kidding.\n        \u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d\n        I laughed again in disbelief. While I didn\u2019t want to insult him, I wanted to subtly address how silly it sounded.\n        \u201cSome childhood dreams just don\u2019t hold up. I\u2019ve abandoned tons of them myself. I used to want to be a firefighter, so I could rescue people and fight flames. I\u2019m afraid of fire now.\u201d\n        He shrugged, turning around. \u201cI\u2019d never abandon my dreams. It\u2019d be like abandoning myself.\u201d\n        I didn\u2019t know what he meant by that final phrase, but I didn\u2019t reply. We continued walking through the forest, changing the subject in a matter of minutes. Still, I could never forget the interaction, even after we graduated, moved to different states, and eventually fell out of regular contact.\n        This eerie memory resurfaced as I spoke to an old friend on the phone for the first time in months.         Lee went hiking in Appalachia two weeks prior. He\u2019d always held a fascination with the lore of the region and had finally made the journey out. However, he didn\u2019t return. \n        His partner, Jerry, called me in a panic with this news. I hadn\u2019t spoken to Jerry or Lee in years, but I felt we could still all be considered friends. I was thankful to be called, though nervous while I listened to him explain the disheartening news.\n        While he mentioned the important details first, he was all over the place. Rightly so, but I did what I could to try and calm him down.\n        \u201cBreathe, we\u2019re going to figure this out. Have you filed a missing person\u2019s report?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cYes, I did. I did.\u201d His breathing slowed just barely. \u201cHe\u2019s never gotten lost on a hike before. I\u2019m worried sick.\u201d\n        Jerry knew I was an avid survivalist. I'd been obsessed with the outdoors since childhood, and I\u2019d eventually teach survival training at a boot camp in North Carolina. Lee and I bonded over our love of nature after we met in middle school, and while he\u2019d recreationally learned some outdoor survival techniques alongside me, he was never quite proficient.\n        Jerry also knew I lived in Boone, North Carolina, an hour outside of Lee\u2019s intended destination. It wasn\u2019t hard to connect the dots on why I\u2019d received a call.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s been gone for two whole weeks, and I\u2019ve heard nothing from the authorities, nothing about when the search parties are going out... I don\u2019t know what to do, Humphrey.\u201d\n        It had been years since Lee and I had spoken, but I hated the idea of my old friend lost and helpless in the woods. Jerry was a great friend to me, too, and I couldn\u2019t bear hearing him so distraught. \n        I wasn\u2019t sure I could find Lee on my own, but I knew I wanted to try. That, and I wouldn\u2019t mind a nice solo-hike on the Appalachian Trail. As a survivalist, I was certainly better equipped to do so than Lee was. Despite the distance that had grown between us after college, I couldn\u2019t help but see this as a chance to save a friend\u2019s life. \n        I relayed these thoughts to Jerry, and the relief in his voice confirmed that I was doing the right thing.\n        In the following minutes, I gathered all the information that I could from him before ending the call with a final question.\n        \u201cWhat was the last thing Lee said to you?\u201d\n        He hesitated, sighing sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning. The last thing he texted me was that he finally believed in Sasquatch.\u201d\n        \u201cSasquatch?\u201d I asked, almost wanting to laugh. I remembered how much he loved Bigfoot but felt an eerie feeling wash over me, surprised it was the last thing he\u2019d told Jerry.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s been looking stuff up about it the past few weeks. He was pretty active in a Bigfoot hunting forum and said it had been sighted in Appalachia recently. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time. I hope he didn\u2019t see a bear.\u201d\n        \u201cOr worse, Bigfoot.\u201d I joked. Jerry didn\u2019t laugh.\n        \u2018Rescue\u2019 may be a dramatic word, but it certainly felt like I was embarking on a vigilante rescue mission of sorts. I\u2019d loaded up my Subaru with camping gear, maps, blankets, bottles of water, dehydrated foods, rope, flashlights \u2013 anything that could benefit us in an emergency. After less than an hour of driving along highways soon narrowing into long and scenic roads, I arrived in the town of Damascus, nicknamed \u201cTrail Town\u201d. Though Jerry had little information to relay to me, he told me Lee\u2019s itinerary began with the Virginia Creeper Trail. He\u2019d intended to switch onto the Appalachian Trail at the first point they intersected. I decided to follow this route and relied on my intuition, attempting to channel Lee\u2019s sense of direction.\n        Heading towards the Virginia Creeper Trail with a compass in hand, I made my way northbound and set up camp after six full hours of hiking. I explored every beaten path I could find, staring through the green of the forest, looking on the ground and in the trees for any possible trace of my old friend. A knot of anxiety swelled in my throat when I thought of him alone in the woods, especially at night. No one wanted such a fate for their loved ones. \n        Of course, that\u2019s where I found myself. Once night fell, I struggled to ignore the odd noises from outside my tent, white-knuckling a can of bear repellent as I did my best to fall asleep. The night didn\u2019t pass easily, but after the early hours of the morning, I finally succumbed to my exhaustion.\n        I woke up with a renewed sense of urgency. That day, I covered significant ground and moved deep into the Appalachian forest, but I found no sign of Lee anywhere. I asked a number of strangers on the trail\u2014much fewer than I\u2019d seen the day before\u2014if they\u2019d keep an eye out for a man with brown hair and brown eyes, standing about six feet two. I hoped to come across a member of Lee\u2019s prospective search party, but frustratingly enough, I never did.\n        I found myself thinking again and again about our conversation during the Flatirons hike so long ago. What if Lee had intentionally gone missing? What if he didn\u2019t want to be found? I couldn\u2019t reconcile these thoughts with the Sasquatch text Jerry told me about. I feared that Lee wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind. \n        I set up camp at nightfall once again. It was far quieter than the night before, but finally falling into the lull of sleep, I swore that I heard the booming of giant footsteps echoing through the woods. I dismissed it as my imagination running wild, fueled by my concerns over Lee\u2019s last text.\n        The following day passed in a nervous, sleep-deprived daze. I refused to lose hope. I repeated an affirming mantra in my head to convince myself: I\u2019ll find him. I\u2019ll find him. I\u2019ll find him! My belief in the statement waxed and waned as I walked endlessly, feeling like I was going in circles. Maybe I was. \n        At the first signs of dusk, I finally received the clues I was looking for. Too far off the beaten path and dangerously remote from my camp, I smelled smoke. Despite my better judgment, I followed the distinct campfire scent towards the sherbet-colored horizon as it melted into nightfall. \n        Through densely wooded trees in the distance, I could discern the outline of rising smoke plumes.         In my delirious excitement, I broke into a full run, desperate to see who it was. Even if it wasn\u2019t Lee, I hadn\u2019t seen another person the entire day.\n        Moving closer, I was overcome with the sweetest, most satisfying relief. There he was, not only alive but making a fire all by himself! He\u2019d always struggled in the past, and I felt an unexpected pride. I wish I could\u2019ve called Jerry right at that moment to tell him Lee was safe.\n        I watched him for a moment in a nearby thicket of trees. He diligently turned the firewood with a long branch, throwing on handfuls of pine-needle covered kindling with ease.\n        I surveyed the scene. He\u2019d set up a small green tent, apparently acquired his own wood considering the ax wedged into a nearby stump, and... I squinted at a giant brown lump on the ground, illuminated by the flames. \n        Was that a dead deer?\n        Lee would never hunt. While he wasn\u2019t vegetarian, he mocked the few hunters we grew up with, and he had never touched a gun. His \u2018surviving on the land\u2019 remark from our hike together came across as so ridiculous considering who I knew him to be; looking at him again in the orange glow of the campfire, it seemed I didn\u2019t know him at all.\n        Looking closer, he didn\u2019t even seem distressed. If anything, he looked to be in better health than I remembered him.\n        It didn\u2019t matter, I couldn\u2019t wait anymore. My rescue mission was nearly complete.\n        \u201cLee!\u201d I cried out, realizing too late that I\u2019d risked giving him a heart attack. He quickly stood, frantically glancing around him.\n        I sprinted towards the small clearing he had set up camp in, nearly breathless. \u201cLee!\u201d I repeated, standing before him, and I watched his expression shift into total shock.\n        Against the light of the fire as dusk began to fall, I watched him grow pale. Tears emerged at the corners of his eyes, shiny in the light of the novice campfire.\n        \u201cNot you.\u201d He muttered, blinking intensely. \u201cNot you. Why are you here, Humphrey?\u201d\n        I just stared at him, completely perplexed. I scoffed in response.\n        \u201cDude, what? Why are you here?\u201d\n        He covered his face with his hands, squatting low to the ground. He released a long groan, somewhere between angry and annoyed. \u201cOh, man. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come.\u201d\n        I stood there watching him, my patience growing thin. He turned and looked up at me with growing fear in his eyes.\n        \"You've gotta get out of here, now. I mean, right now. Run,\u201d he insisted, his voice cracking twice.         He\u2019d never spoken to me like that before. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a chance you can make it. Just run.\u201d\n        His insistence was alarming, but it didn\u2019t quell my overwhelming anger and frustration. I\u2019d never yelled at him before, but I couldn\u2019t contain myself now. \n        \u201cLee, I\u2019ve been in these woods for days on end looking for you! You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m here! You\u2019re officially a missing person, did you know that?\u201d I swallowed the growing knot in my throat, feeling myself become more and more angry.  \u201cJerry\u2019s worried sick about you! He cares about you enough, and I care about you enough, to drag your sorry-\u201d\n        \u201cHumphrey!\u201d He screamed into the night, and it silenced me immediately. Lee raised his fists in exasperation. \n        \u201cThere\u2019s no time left! I\u2019m trying to save your life. He\u2019s coming.\u201d\n        As he spoke, I debated if I could grab the bear repellent in my backpack without alarming him. I wasn\u2019t sure how dangerous he was in this unpredictable state.\n        \u201cWho\u2019s coming, Lee?\u201d I asked, and he rattled off one of the most incomprehensible statements I\u2019d ever heard.\n        \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019m trying to save your life. I joined a forum about a year ago that taught how to find Sasquatch. I didn\u2019t know if it was real, but the more I read, the more I wanted to try it.\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t take this, Lee,\u201d I interrupted, fed up with the wild narrative. \u201cStop it! You abandoned Jerry, you abandoned everyone!\u201d\n        \u201cJerry knew I always wanted to do this. I needed this, Humphrey, I would never abandon my dreams!\u201d He yelled. We stood in an uncomfortable moment of silence. The surprising claim he\u2019d made on our hike five years ago had become a prophecy: he really would abandon everything and everyone to live in the woods, alone. \n        Well, maybe not alone. Bigfoot was such a ridiculous notion that I couldn't entertain it.\n        \u201cI came out here to try and summon him, and it actually worked. I brought him raw chicken as an offering, and he allowed me to live. We made a deal. \n        \u201cHe brings me food,\u201d he said, sticking a hand out towards the deer, \u201cand protects me from predators, so I can live out here safely. He helps me thrive out here. And I do the same thing for him.\u201d\n        Despite the absurdity of the situation, I got chills when he said the cryptid\u2019s name. I wanted so badly to laugh, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling I was trapped in a nightmare I desperately had to get out of.\n        Swallowing, I humored him as a last attempt at making him see his own irrationality.\n        \"Sorry... You feed him, Lee?\u201d\n        I expected some exasperated grasping at straws, some wild explanation of his quid-pro-quo arrangement with Bigfoot, but Lee only stared back at me. \n        Something in his eyes sent shivers down my spine. His expression was humorless and foreboding.\n        \u201cFine,\u201d he said, starting to cry. He ran a shaky hand through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t believe me, but he and         I made a pact, and I won\u2019t break it. I won\u2019t go back\u2026 And you probably won\u2019t, either.\u201d Squatting down near the fire, I heard him let out a quiet whimper of despair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He hissed.\n        A loud crack in the distance made me jump. Suddenly, I realized that even if it wasn\u2019t Bigfoot, someone was barreling towards us regardless. I heard distant rustling draw closer as I began rifling through my backpack, searching desperately for the bear repellent, my flashlight, anything.\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Lee? Come on, grab the ax! Do something!\u201d I cried out in exasperation, spit flying from my lips.\n        Lee turned around and took a shaky breath.\n        \u201cHumphrey, I told you to run.\u201d\n        I watched his face remain unchanged as I turned to see a figure as tall as the treetops rising rapidly in the distance, trees collapsing hard on the forest floor as it passed. \n        Though Lee had insisted I run, I found myself frozen to the spot in fear, completely paralyzed at this sudden break in reality. I saw him sprint into the woods and slip into the darkness, abandoning me. I was frozen to the spot, standing in front of the campfire, all alone, but not quite.\n        As I frantically gathered my wits among a cacophony of falling trees, a strong gust of wind from the forest behind me blew back the campfire flames. I heard inhuman grunts and snorts in between the ground-shaking steps that approached me from behind. \n        At that moment, I accepted the terrifying truth: Sasquatch must be real, but I couldn\u2019t bear to turn around and face him in what might be my final moments.\n        I watched as a shadow the size of a mountain overcame my tiny silhouette."}

But solitude in our time seems difficult to find and hold on to.\n        A person could be forgiven for thinking that the nation of Allustria would be ideal for those needing solitude. It tends toward the assertively mountainous, making overland travel difficult if not impossible for those without the means, and most of the higher peaks have year-round snow. But dirigibles have become commonplace in the past decade, allowing people to travel farther than ever at a fraction of the cost. And Allustria, once derided as a place very few would seek out despite stunning vistas, suddenly became a desirable destination for travelers seeking novel experiences. \n        Travel opens the world, but it also makes finding solitude more difficult.\n        But after some extensive research, and a certain amount of bribery to parties who knew people who knew people, I\u2019d leased a cabin well away from the main travel routes. It had been intended as a noble\u2019s hunting lodge. Kirenna, the woman who owned the cabin, told me that when I met with her about the lease. \n        Admittedly, it was possibly too large to properly be considered a cabin. It had two stories, with the lower space devoted to a living area, small library, bathing room, and kitchen, while the upper space was more of a loft where one could sleep and benefit from the rising heat.\n        It was also fully furnished: seating enough for six people, or eight if you were very comfortable with each other. There was a kitchen with a larder, a cold closet, and a stove that was powered by crystals of solidified mana, a dining area with hutches for plates and utensils, a bathtub and indoor toilet, and a luxuriously sized bed on which three people could sleep comfortably. \n        The man at least had excellent taste in his materials, though I\u2019m sure nearly all the wood and most of the stone were imported from Solust. The furniture frames were all polished, reddish-blonde wood, the cushions were stuffed with down and covered with a soft, sturdy linen, and blankets sewn of rabbit fur were draped across nearly every seating surface. Meanwhile, the kitchen and bathing room used a pale, speckled granite that added to the lightness of the interior, making the space seem even bigger than it was.\n        Less than a month after it was completed, however, the common folk overthrew the nobility of Solust. The man didn\u2019t even have time to flee that country for his hunting lodge before he was imprisoned, then executed. His loss was my gain, and I\u2019d never had much use for nobility, even in my home nation of Lanivet.\n        The former noble\u2019s taste in books was questionable. When I first arrived, there were three books in total. Two of them were the same guide to animals of the region, one heavily marked with notes on possible hunting techniques and the other pristine. The third was, shall we say, an indiscreet romance featuring a noble wooing his way through a bevy of common but beautiful women. I sent all three back with Kirenna the first time she delivered supplies, and she laughed, saying they\u2019d make good kindling.\n        Once a week, Kirenna would stop by with mostly foodstuffs and other non-durable goods. I\u2019d make her lunch, then give her whatever writing I\u2019d completed over the course of the week for the next mail carriage. In exchange, I got to hear about her town of Marden, the goings-on, her wife and husband and the general store they ran, as well as hilarious tales of travelers stunned by the sophistication of what they\u2019d thought was a provincial backwater. After I discovered she had a special fondness for frostberry tarts, I started making those for her in appreciation for all the time she took from her life to help me maintain my solitude. \n        When I first arrived, I\u2019d intended to spend most of my time writing. Between my academic work on the language of the ancients who once walked this world but disappeared some time ago, and my slowly growing career writing tales where damsels turned the tables on their captors and became heroes, I anticipated being able to write to my heart\u2019s content without interruption.\n        After all, I had enough magic to keep the rooms lit, the water tank from freezing over, and myself warm when I ventured outside into the valley I currently called home. The great mages called such magic petty, but it was more than enough for a simple life. Their spells worked on a much grander scale: balancing weather, banishing malevolent entities, enabling communication between the leaders of nations, and the like. My gifts were sufficient to sustain myself in the solitude I\u2019d chosen. \n        My first month at the cabin was something of a revelation; I had desired solitude without remembering the cost in effort needed for the tasks of basic living. The amenities included by the now-dead noble eased my circumstances somewhat, but I still needed to launder my clothing, clean up after cooking, and gather supplies from the surrounding valley to supplement what I\u2019d brought with me. I\u2019ll admit, I had a great deal to learn, but at least it was the middle of spring when I arrived. Kirenna gave me a map she\u2019d made of the valley, citing locations and resources that she thought would be helpful, and provided a few pointers for someone more accustomed to a city than the mountains of Allustria.\n        As the months wore on, I grew more and more comfortable with my surroundings. Kirenna expressed a bit of surprise that I\u2019d thrown myself into the more practical aspects of my existence; over lunch once, she confessed that her first impression of me was that I was a spoiled academic with more money than sense.\n        I laughed and confided my history to her. My mother had wanted her daughter to have opportunities in the world that weren\u2019t limited by her appearance. Growing up, I had learned practical skills more suited to an urban life, but I\u2019d also studied more scholarly pursuits. The universities of Lanivet were remarkably accepting, and offered scholarships to those who could demonstrate an aptitude for a given area of study. I passed the exams, and spent the next decade and more in the halls of a university that did its best to provide for the students\u2019 every need. So while I was now learning entirely new things, I at least had a history of a more practical sort.\n        But with the end of the short, mild summer, a new complication arose. Allustria\u2019s sudden popularity as a travel destination meant that a tourist had discovered skiing. While the people of Allustria used skis to more easily traverse the terrain, the tourist told all of his friends about what he perceived as something more recreational. \n        Allustria\u2019s economy was booming thanks to the influx of visitors, so of course the king asked the weather mages to ensure there would be more snow than usual over the winter. Kirenna warned me that while my solitude was unlikely to be broken, she couldn\u2019t guarantee that her supply trips would continue with any regularity due to the planned increase of snowy weather.\n        \u201cI appreciate your concern,\u201d I told her, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been stockpiling as much as I can, and I did read that noble\u2019s annotated hunting book. I\u2019m not an avid fan of hunting, but I can at least set snares and plan for the leaner months.\u201d\n        She gave me a look that I recognized as exasperated concern, but once I showed her the improvements I\u2019d made to the larder, as well as the small greenhouse I\u2019d built, she conceded that I might not starve in between visits. Touched by her concern, I made sure to send her home with enough frostberry tarts for her and her partners.\n        When the first snowstorm hit, I spent the first few days focused entirely on practical matters. It took some time to adjust to moving in snowshoes, and it helped that I knew the terrain well enough to not get lost. I also kept the path from my door to the stables clear for Kirenna, though I did not love shoveling snow over and over again. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that the architect of the cabin had set up a means to use snowmelt to refill the water tank, but I probably should have cleaned the mechanisms before the snow started falling.\n        When Kirenna finally showed up a week and a half after her last delivery, she was pleasantly surprised to see me doing as well as I was. Sheepishly, I admitted that I\u2019d found the practical work a refreshing change of pace, and hadn\u2019t really written anything new to send back with her.\n        \u201cI\u2019m sure your editors will understand that your characters will just have to stay in perilous circumstances for a bit longer,\u201d Kirenna teased.\n        \u201cBut not too much longer,\u201d I grinned, \u201csince it\u2019s the sales of those stories that help me pay for this.\u201d\n        \u201cI never asked, does writing pay all that well?\u201d\n        Searing some venison in a pan on the stove, I shook my head. \u201cIt pays enough that most of those funds go into your pocket for my supplies. I admit, when I first got the scholarship to the university, I took the money and used it to gamble. After three days, I walked away with triple the money I\u2019d been awarded for that first year, then I invested in my mother\u2019s business. That investment is what\u2019s paid for the rest.\u201d\n        Kirenna laughed. \u201cYou are far too interesting to be hiding away here!\u201d\n        I grinned as I transferred the cooked meat to plates. \u201cAnd yet, I am far more comfortable away from people. When you grow up in a city, there\u2019s always a crowd around you. I found fairly quickly that having a few people around me is fine, but once that number goes past five, I suddenly want to find a quiet room away from them.\u201d\n        \u201cThis must suit you quite well, then,\u201d she mused, tilting her head at me like a bird.\n        \u201cIt does, but I do get a bit lonely from time to time. Your visits do a great deal to alleviate that, but I\u2019d not pull you away from your wife and husband for longer than they might be comfortable with.\u201d\n        She snorted. \u201cThey\u2019ve been nudging me to ask you whether you\u2019d be interested in me.\u201d\n        I barely managed to set my fork down instead of dropping it. \u201cThat seems, I don\u2019t know, a bit odd?\u201d\n        \u201cWhat? That my marriage to my partners might be comfortable enough that they\u2019d tease me about my interest in you? And encourage me to pursue you, should you be interested?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m familiar with open relationships,\u201d I began slowly, \u201cand Lanivet has a history of people living in healthy triads, especially among the common classes. But the three of you seemed utterly content with each other when I first arrived in Marden.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd we still are,\u201d Kirenna countered instantly, \u201cwhich doesn\u2019t preclude any of us expressing interest in another person. You\u2019re thoughtful and kind, which are not the same thing, you\u2019re not afraid of hard work, and by all the gods can you cook.\u201d She held up a bit of the venison and shook her head. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done here with the local herbs, it\u2019s to die for.\u201d\n        \u201cAh,\u201d I teased, \u201cit\u2019s all about my cooking.\u201d \n        \u201cNo, truly, Romaya, it\u2019s not.\u201d She rolled her eyes fondly at me. \u201cMarden is an isolated town in a nation that\u2019s never been all that popular. You\u2019ve become part of the town, even here in this cabin. And while the people of Marden treat you like a bit of a celebrity, we understand how much you treasure your solitude. Nobody is going to tell the tourists about you.\u201d She had more of the venison while I sat in stunned silence, then continued, \u201cMy partners and I have been keeping your privacy as best we can, but word has gotten around.\u201d\n        I blinked. \u201cCelebrity?\u201d\n        \u201cThe noble built this cabin four summers ago, and it\u2019s been empty until you came. You leased the place for a whole year and discussed possibly staying longer. And you get and send things regularly through the mail. There was bound to be curiosity about you.\u201d Kirenna grinned. \u201cMy partners and I do our best to keep the gossip to a minimum.\u201d\n        I looked down at my plate, and started eating again. I hadn\u2019t really considered the impact I\u2019d have on Marden, I\u2019d just been looking for somewhere I could live away from people. \n        \u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured after finishing my food.\n        \u201cFor what?\u201d\n        \u201cFor all your help, and your company. I\u2019ve looked forward to your visits and spending time with you. Even if it\u2019s only been a few hours each week.\u201d\n        \u201cDo I detect a note of interest beyond that?\u201d she said with a wink.\n        \u201cI think so? Like I said, it\u2019s only been a few hours each week. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve been on our best behavior around each other.\u201d\n        Suddenly, Kirenna stood, strode to the front door, and gestured out at the heavy snowfall that must have started while we were eating. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said, mock dramatically, \u201cit\u2019s snowing. Whatever shall I do. I\u2019m sure the snow is too heavy for me to return to my partners.\u201d\n        I started laughing. \u201cDid you plan this?\u201d\n        \u201cMy timing? Of course! If you weren\u2019t at all interested, I\u2019d have kept you company for the next couple of days and returned home with no hard feelings. At least now we have the time to figure things out.\u201d\n        I grinned. Solitude had been enticing when I moved here, but I was open to change and company as well.\n"}

It\u2019s beautiful here at this cabin in the mountains. I\u2019m not usually a fan of being in the mountains, but even I must say that the pine trees look festive covered in their blankets of glistening white. The ground sparkles as the moonlight hits the snow, broken only by the paw prints of forest creatures. The cabin welcomes us with white lights around the doors and windows, there is a decorated tree inside. \n        The moment we get inside the cabin, Sprite, my whippet, throws a massive temper tantrum. She rolls on the floor trying to get her dog coat off. Although this is a romantic get away, since there was no plane travel required for this trip, I argued my dog should come with us. I liberate her from her winter apparel, and then take mine off. \n         It\u2019s magical here. I\u2019ll give him that. Of course, it\u2019s not Italy, but I lost the card game which means Kevin, my boyfriend, got to choose where we would go for our first weekend away together. It\u2019s our six-month anniversary. The holiday cheer of this cabin is infectious. Sprite is running about the cabin, examining everything. Thankfully, she is smart enough not to get too close to the fireplace. The roaring fire is really a nice touch.\n        There is a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket next to an elaborate cheese and fruit platter. Cheese is the way to my heart, so the sting of not being in Italy at the moment softens even more. I hear a pop as he opens the champagne. We have a toast and then take the cheese tray with us so we can sit next to the fire. Sprite comes running toward us and spins out on the wood floor in her excitement to get to the cheese.  \n        While there is no cable here, there is internet, so we are able to play songs from our phone. It\u2019s incredibly cozy and relaxing. All three of us are now snuggled up under a blanket in front of the fireplace. The cheese, champagne, and warmth of the fire beckons us into a blissful slumber. \n        We wake up in the cool morning. The fire has gone out. I bundle Sprite up and take her outside. When we get in, Kevin is in the small kitchen making us breakfast. The smell of coffee perks me up. I give Sprite her breakfast and then sit at one of the tall chairs at the kitchen island. Everything here is made of light colored wood. Kevin brings me a cup of coffee in a large green mug with an embossed tree on it. So, maybe I was wrong about taking trips to remote mountain cabins. So far this one is off to a spectacular start. It\u2019s not Italy, but it\u2019s growing on me. \n        After breakfast, I take a shower and change into some fresh clothing.  I dress Sprite and myself up for the outdoors, and we are ready for our hike. It\u2019s snowing outside. Just the right amount to be magical, but not enough to sting my cheeks. As we begin our hike, Kevin leads the way. After all, I know nothing about forest trails. \n        At first, the hike is absolutely gorgeous. We\u2019re in an area where we can see the valley and in the distance the snow covered mountain peaks. I begin to sing, \u201csleigh bells rings, are you listening.\u201d Sprite is running ahead of me in wavy patterns, trying to eat the snowflakes. When she reaches the end of her lead, she runs back to me and then repeats the pattern. \n        The dark clouds that seemed so distant when we set off are now approaching us at a faster pace. I suggest that we turn back to the cabin so we don\u2019t get caught in a blizzard. Kevin assures me that he checked the weather and there is not supposed to be a blizzard. I\u2019m starting to feel nervous. There is nothing but trees around us, and I don\u2019t know how to find my way back to the cabin. The falling snow now feels sinister, covering our tracks. I wonder if my phone\u2019s map works in an area as remote as this. \n        Kevin is walking confidently ahead. The snowfall is becoming heavier and the wind is picking up. I insist that we turn back. After all, the cabin is amazing, and we can watch the snow falling from the safety of our warm, cozy cabin. Sitting in front of the fire sounds really nice to me at the moment. However, Kevin insists we make it to our planned destination, an overlook that is supposed to have a spectacular view of the mountain range. I tell him we can go tomorrow. \n        The wind is picking up, and I\u2019m really frightened now. Sprite is no longer running happily in front of me. She is by my side. Suddenly, there is a huge gust of wind. I can\u2019t see Kevin any longer. I yell for him, but there is no response. I see a big blurry object making its way toward me at a measured pace. It must be Kevin. Snow is violently swirling around me. My eyelashes are frozen. \n        I\u2019m starting to really panic now. How are we going to find our way back to the cabin in a blizzard? The blurry object continues to approach us. \n        Oh. My. God. It\u2019s a big brown bear. \n        I pick up Sprite and scream. I\u2019ve no idea what to do. Should I run? Isn\u2019t the bear going to be faster than me? I hear the deafening sound of my screams as the bear continues to approach Sprite and me. I\u2019m frozen in terror. My heart is palpitating, and I feel this immense pressure in my head pounding in a rhythmic pattern. I hear that same drumming sound in my ears.

She had hated to kill a female, but something had been eating all the wild turkeys in the area. She assumed it was a bear, but she was wrong. Either way, meat was meat. She put it out of its misery and started the journey home to process it.\n        Mary followed the smoke line curling up from her cabin chimney in the distance. Within an hour, she was sweating even beneath the layers of animal skin and cotton long johns. Soon the Ponderosa pines gave way to an opening in the forest leading to her cabin.\n        The cabin itself was typical in its design, with a steeply gabled roof and a small front porch. But the materials used in its construction were what made it special. Mary and her wife Jane had come upon the cabin while hunting in the forest eight years ago. Mary thought it was just another dilapidated log abode, but Jane\u2019s father had been a carpenter. She immediately saw that it was made of Engelmann spruce, a slow-growing evergreen found in the Sangre de Cristos mountains of northern New Mexico. The wood was extremely weather-resistant and must have been hauled down with some effort by the builders.\n        Mary hauled the cat carcass up the wooden steps, leaving a slick trail of blood behind her. She took one of the meat hooks she used for deer processing that was attached to a chain and pulley system and stuck it into the cat\u2019s back. She wound the crank on the side of the porch, lifting the animal high. Mary grabbed her apron and began the dirty business of skinning and gutting the dead mountain lion.\n        The sun started to set on the horizon, spilling over the mountain peaks of central New Mexico in vivid hues of orange, purple, and crimson. Mary had just put the meat into her storage cellar when a horse and two riders emerged from the forest edge. Mary felt a twinge of fear extend up her spine to the back of her skull. She had left her gun inside.\n        Her concern was largely dispelled when she saw that the riders were women. Men were the real threat in this area. The first woman got down from the horse and then helped the other woman dismount. The two people looked vaguely familiar to Mary.\n        Both women were dressed in the typical winter gear of the Mescalero Apaches. They were wrapped tightly in large deer skin blankets elaborately painted with geometric symbols in red and black, likely important markers for their particular clans. They also sported leather moccasins, lightly beaded with turquoise stones, that came up above their knees and covered their tanned animal skin leggings.\n        The Mescalero Apaches had lived across the Southwestern United States for thousands of years, but in the late nineteenth century, they were relegated to a small section of their traditional territory in central New Mexico by the US government. Their mountainous reservation was close to Mary\u2019s cabin in the Lincoln Forest.\n        \"Hello, Nurse Mary. You probably don't remember me. My name is Idella. I have not seen you for a long time.\u201d Idella spoke slowly with the clipped American accent so typical of the Apache peoples of the area. \u201cThis is my mother, Euphrasia.\u201d\n        The older woman gave a frail wave. Her hair was a mix of jet black and stark white. Her skin was the color of ash wood, and she looked tired and gaunt. Mary could immediately see that she was ill and gestured for the pair to come inside the cabin.\n        She kept the place as tidy as she could. Jane had always been better at that. She cooked, and Jane cleaned. That was the deal. Mary had a small wooden table and four chairs on the right side of the room, next to the kitchen stove and a cupboard. At the moment, the iron stove was burning a stack of pine wood. A pot of stew bubbled away on the stovetop, giving off the scent of sage, wild onions, and pinon nuts. Her bedroom door was behind her, cracked open just enough to reveal the creaky brass bed with Jane\u2019s family quilt thrown across it. To the left of her and next to the fireplace were two red armchairs. When Jane and Mary found the place, they were the only pieces of furniture, other than the big-bellied stove, inside.\n        Mary took the older woman by the hand and walked her to the bedroom. She carefully laid her down on the bed and asked Idella what brought them here all the way from Carrizo Springs. \n        \u201cMama started feeling tired around two months ago. I thought it was just her age. She is nearly seventy. But now she is bruising easily and has lost weight. And look. Show her, Mama.\u201d Idella said. \n        Euphrasia leaned her head back against the pillow on Mary\u2019s bed. A large lump lay beneath the skin on her throat. Mary sighed deeply. It looked just like Jane\u2019s had before she died.\n        Mary went over to the corner and pulled out a key on a chain around her neck. She then unlocked a large, wooden chest. Inside were an assortment of items from before the bombs came. Looking at these representations of her old life, Mary sometimes felt as if the future was in the past and the past was in the present as she lived out some bizarre Western dream in the mountains. Photos, nonfunctional cell phones, and documents such as passports from their old lives were buried beneath emergency ammunition for the hunting rifle and prescription medications that Mary had hoarded from her previous job as a travel nurse. This was also where Mary kept a portable IV kit, some extra saline, and a few other things from the Mesilla clinic when they left the town eight years ago.\n        \u201cEuphrasia, you are very dehydrated. I am going to set you up with some IV fluids and then have a little chat with your daughter. Idella, make yourself comfortable in the chair next to the fireplace. I will get things going in here, and then we can talk.\"\n        Mary set up the saline drip and gently covered Euphrasia with Jane\u2019s quilt. Shutting the door behind her, she went into the living room. She grabbed a bottle of whiskey and two glasses out of the cupboard, blowing the dust out of them in two big breaths. She poured each of them a double, handing a glass to Idella before sitting down in the red chair across from her. The snow was falling hard now, and it was obvious to both of them that the pair would need to stay the night.\n        Idella sat back, her long, black hair spilling out from her blanket in silky, rolling waves. She was in her early forties, the same age as Mary. Mary saw her often in summers past when she and Jane traveled to the Mesilla market. Idella and her mother operated a stand on Sundays in the plaza, selling tamales alongside produce grown at their farm in Carrizo Springs. Idella spoke, \u201cYou think it is cancer, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n        Mary took a swig of her whiskey and said, \u201cThe throat nodules are not a smoking gun for cancer. But paired with the other symptoms, it's very likely. And we know that thyroid cancer is common among survivors. Let me ask you this, where was she when the bomb hit Phoenix? I need to know more about her exposure.\u201d \n        A tear made its way down one of Idella\u2019s cheeks. She wiped it with the back of her hand. \u201cWe were at the ranch when the bombs dropped. TV and cell service went out, but the radios were still working. Stations began emergency broadcasts and told us to take cover from the impending fallout. You know our history with the US government. We were lucky on the reservation to have electricity and clean water, much less bomb shelters. But my uncle had worked as a power line repairman for the Air Force at the White Sands military base thirty-five miles south. He told us that he knew of an underground shelter that was built by the army engineers during World War II.\u201d\n        \u201cIt was not on any maps, but he recalled passing by the entrance when they repaired lines in the area. He said that with some heavy-duty tools and blowtorches, we might have a chance of breaking through. We gathered as many of our people as we could, maybe three dozen, and high-tailed it to White Sands. We saw the dust coming like a smoking tidal wave across the white dunes west of us. We could feel the heat on our faces. The children were screaming, and people began to panic, digging into the ground with their fingers like animals. The elders fell to their knees and prayed to the gahns, the mountain spirits, to protect us, just as my uncle and the other men broke through the sealed hull of that place with the blow torches. We piled into the darkness and slammed the hull door shut right when it hit. We stayed there for three weeks before we decided to take the chance and leave.\u201d\n        Mary replied with her own terrible story, \u201cJane and I were working at the clinic in Mesilla. Fortunately, we were across the street from the town hall. They had one of those old bomb shelters from the Cold War in the basement. A hundred people squeezed inside. The mayor didn\u2019t have the heart to turn anyone away. We ran out of food within ten days and had to leave. I blame that early exposure to the fallout radiation for the cancer that took Jane from me three years ago.\u201d Mary spoke with a note of sadness in her voice. \u201cBut three weeks should have been plenty of time for the radiation to dissipate for your Mama?\u201d\n        Idella looked up, as if trying to roll the tears back into her eyes. \u201cMama left the shelter early. We woke up on day eight, and she was gone. I wanted to go after her, but my uncle told me that if I did, he would never forgive me. When we returned home, she was there and seemed fine. She had said she couldn\u2019t bear to leave the horses penned up to starve, so she left the shelter. She always had a soft spot for animals. Who knows how much radiation she was exposed to then?\u201d\n        Mary reached across and touched Idella\u2019s hand. \u201cIf it is anything like Jane\u2019s sickness, it will be quick. Before the bombs came, your Mama could have been treated at the hospital in Mesilla, but as you know, the clinic there has little beyond basic care now. The hospital in Santa Fe is still functioning, last I heard. They might have some treatments available. But the Camino Real from Mesilla is a tough road to travel. Lots of violent, desperate people out there. I wouldn\u2019t risk her last days on that journey if I were you. I can send you home with some medications. It will make her comfortable when she gets close to the end.\u201d\n        Idella nodded her head and tried to say thank you, but all that emerged was a muffled sob.\n        The two women stared at the crackling fire in front of them. The snow created a silence that covered the cabin in a cold embrace. \n        \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up here alone anymore, Mary. You know the tribal council would love to have someone with your medical expertise on the reservation. It\u2019s been three years now. Do you really think Jane would want you to live so isolated here?\u201d\n        Mary thought of her cabin, the juniper tree forests, and the mule deer that grazed nearby. She thought of the sunsets and the white-capped peaks of the Sierra Blanca. She thought of the smell of pecan wood in the fire and the taste of snowmelt. But then she thought about Jane, always and forever about Jane, and the ever-enduring love that she could take with her like a deer skin blanket into a future that perhaps did not have to be so lonely after all.\n       "}
{"example_id":"example_090","inputs":"Write a story that takes place in a remote cabin in snowy mountains. The majority of the story is a conversation between a couple, John and Ash. They spend a romantic night together watching the snow fall. They reminisce about another snow storm that they were caught in many years ago.

The story should be between 1200-1250 words.","targets":"        Ash couldn\u2019t imagine anything more romantic than being curled up with John in front of a roaring fire in a remote cabin in snowy mountains. They watched the snow fall as they looked out of the enormous floor-to-ceiling windows. The sun had just set over the peaks in the distance, and a pale orange glow still illuminated the sky. John\u2019s arms were gently draped around her. She rubbed her cheek against his soft sweater and then reached to the table to pick up a warm mug of tea.\n        \u201cI think this might be the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d John said, softly rubbing her back.\n        \u201cMe too,\u201d Ash said, taking a sip. She curled her feet up under the blanket.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s really coming down out there. Look at the car,\u201d John said, gesturing out the window to their little sedan. It was now almost completely covered, just a barely distinguishable bump in the enormous snow drift.\n        \u201cGood thing we don\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d Ash said, yawning. John took the mug from her hand.\n        \u201cDo you remember when I went to visit you in Baltimore when you were still at Loyola and I got stuck in that huge snowstorm?\u201d John asked.\n        \u201cSnowpocalypse 2006!\u201d Ash clapped her hands together.\n        \u201cRemember, you didn\u2019t own a shovel, so we had to use lunch trays from the cafeteria to dig out the car?\u201d\n        \u201cIt took hours!\u201d\n        \u201cAnd then once we got it dug out, I was still stuck because the roads were so bad.\u201d\n        \u201cRight. I was selfishly excited to have you to myself for two whole extra days.\u201d\n        \u201cBut I was no fun to be around, remember?\u201d\n        \u201cYou were always fun to be around,\u201d she said, and then gave him a light kiss.\n        \u201cYou were the fun one. I was awful that weekend,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been awful in your whole life, John,\u201d she said as she gave him a teasing nudge.\n        \u201cI couldn\u2019t drive back to campus, so I missed that big chemistry exam.\u201d John took a sip of her tea and made a face. \u201cGreen?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cI have Earl Grey in the cupboard. I remember you pacing around my dorm room doing that swinging thing that you do with your arms. You were convinced that if you missed that test, you\u2019d fail the class,\u201d Ash said.\n        \u201cThen everything would fall apart. I\u2019d lose my scholarship. I\u2019d never be a doctor. It felt like the end of the world. I was such a mess,\u201d John replied.\n        \u201cYou? A mess?\u201d Ash laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re the least messy person I\u2019ve ever met. I was the mess. Remember? I was drunk that whole weekend. I made you walk to the liquor store in the blizzard.\u201d\n        \u201cYou only kept me around that year because I was already 21.\u201d John smiled at her. \n        \u201cNah. I had an excellent fake ID. I kept you around because you were so cute.\u201d \n        \u201cIf you like skinny, prematurely balding dudes who look like Kermit the Frog.\u201d\n        \u201cKermit the Frog?\u201d She looked at him, squinted, and laughed. \u201cWell, maybe a little. The color is wrong but there is something Kermit-y about your face. I think it's the friendliness. But if you\u2019re Kermit, I am most certainly Miss Piggy. Kermit is an order Muppet. Miss Piggy is pure chaos.\u201d\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t be Miss Piggy. Miss Piggy needs to be a blonde,\u201d he said as he took a lock of her long, dark curls in his fingers.\n        \u201cBut I\u2019m fabulous and needy,\u201d she retorted.\n        \u201cYou, my dear, are most certainly fabulous, but you\u2019re more aloof than needy,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cAloof. I like that. But, for real, I don\u2019t think I ever apologized for that weekend,\u201d she said, her tone shifting.\n        \u201cNo need,\u201d he said, kissing her again.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would have made it through those years without you.\u201d\n        \u201cI should have done more,\u201d he said, stiffening.\n        \u201cYou know. I think there was a weird part of me that wanted you to fail that test. It was hard for me to be spiraling down while you were on such a straight and narrow path. You had this super-specific vision of the life you wanted. I didn\u2019t think I fit into it.\u201d\n        \"I really thought that I knew exactly what I wanted. But in order to get to this very specific life, I had to walk a tightrope. I had to ace every test, get into the exact right school, and get accepted to the exact right residency. It was exhausting. But you. You were so, I don\u2019t know, free. Is free the right word?\"\n        \u201cMaybe free is the right word. Sometimes I felt free. But I think a better word is untethered. I had no direction. I was out of control,\u201d she replied.\n        \u201cBeing around you never felt out of control. It was exciting. You had guts. I was all squirreled away behind books and you just dropped out of school with no plan and just did whatever you wanted. I thought it was amazing.\u201d\n        She took John\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah, but it was scary too. You were the only stable part of my life, and I asked way too much of you during all of those years,\u201d she said. The lighthearted humor was gone from her voice.\n        \u201cAsh, it was never too much,\u201d he said, matching her tone.\n        \u201cIt was,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.\n        Ash closed her eyes. She remembered John\u2019s face, stricken with concern, the night he bailed her out of jail. He had the same expression the next time he had to bail her out. The late-night calls. The intervention. The time he drove all the way from New York down to Baltimore to drive through the streets at three a.m. trying to track her down after a friend had left a panicked voicemail. The hospital. The long recovery. His tears when she broke up with him for his own good. His smile when she found him again. Even when they'd been apart, he'd always been there. John, her solid rock.\n        John was remembering too. Her wild, young laughter. Her pale face on the hospital bed. Those awful words she said out of kindness. Those slow, grim years when he\u2019d lost track of her.  Lonely nights. Pressure and strain building up behind his eyes as he studied. The dry, dull, lifeless feeling that came over him during their years of separate lives. The rush of joy he felt when, after nearly a decade, he saw her beautiful face again.\n        They both sat in silence.\n        Inside the fireplace, a log tipped over and sent sparks out of the hearth with a loud \u201csnap.\u201d John and Ash jumped back. John laughed and got up from the couch to poke the log back into place. He looked over at Ash who was smiling at him.\n        \u201cAsh, without you, I keep my whole life in a solid box. Everything is organized and in place. But a hearth without a fire is a lifeless stone with no purpose.\u201d\n        \u201cJohn, I can rage out of control and with no direction. An uncontained fire sizzles out or burns too hot and destroys everything.\u201d Ash got up to stand beside him. \u201cI need you, John. You\u2019re my hearth.\u201d\n        \u201cI need you, Ash. You\u2019re my flame.\u201d\n        Together, they tended the fire. All night, it burned steadily and warmed the cozy room as the snow fell around them.\n"}
{"example_id":"example_091","inputs":"Write a story that takes place in a remote cabin in snowy mountains. Keep the word count between 1250 and 1300 words. Make the story about a character named Luke. He is in a cabin with his family. His father is the president. Have Luke, his sister, and his father play a game called Gerrymander. His father is called away on official business and the family stays in the cabin. Luke\u2019s father is assassinated. ","targets":"        When one is asked to imagine a void, the first thing that most people think of is what\u2019s behind their eyes. An infinite nothingness of darkness. But a true void is not inherently dark. The only actual qualification for a void is a completely uninterrupted slate of mundanity. One thing. Forever.\n        I looked out of my cabin window onto a void of white, perfect and unbroken landscape. Monotony manifest. There is no solace for me there. No relief from the agonies inflicted upon me from within these four walls of misery. I cannot even escape into the nothingness, for the simple act of treading upon such absolute stasis would shatter it. I am trapped here in my misery. \n        The clattering sound rings out from behind me once more.\n        \u201cHah! That\u2019s a twelve! Now I get to zoom across the board and move my voting districts wherever I want!\u201d my sister says. \n         I turn to see my tormentors gathered around their implement of torture. My sister was moving her voting brackets around to the most advantageous positions for her party. Across the board, my father quietly calculated his next turn. My mother busied herself with preparing food, paying occasional attention to the game as it played out.\n        My sister turned to me and demanded my return to the rack.\n        \u201cHey, Simon, you\u2019re up after Dad. Stop being all gloomy and start thinking about your turn so we can keep this moving,\u201d she said.\n        The game of Gerrymander was an offshoot of another game about economic domination. That game had fallen out of popularity some time ago due to Gerrymander\u2019s more intricate systems. This one featured a similar system of moving around the edges of a board by rolling dice and picking up certain benefits based on the space the player lands on. The main difference was in the core objective of the game. While the other board game was won by depriving other players of all economic weight, Gerrymander focused on a more esoteric form of currency: political influence.\n        By maneuvering voting districts to strategically exclude certain demographics, one could ensure that their political party would hold more weight, even if it was the less popular group among the people. Such an injustice would be unthinkable in the real world, but it was in fact common to those who knew the ins and outs of the political systems. In the spirit of game balance, the designers made things more interesting by ensuring there wasn\u2019t a predominantly two party system. They fragmented things by making a party for each person playing. It was good game design and the added complexities allowed the game to act as a more effective crucible for future political aspirations.\n        With a resigned sigh, I returned to the rack, which in this instance was a plush chair with entirely too many pillows. The crushing weight of all that fluff was suffocating, but my torture was not complete yet. I had to participate in my own agonies.\n        My dad made his move. It was a masterstroke, taking all the key areas away from my sister and I, securing his easy victory. \n        My sister gaped at the board. \u201cHow did you do that?!\u201d she asked.\n        My dad explained. He used his instructing voice. Soft and quiet, but solid and certain. The words he spoke were pointless, just his way of putting a veneer on top of his true lesson. Be cutthroat. Be merciless. Climb. \n        My sister ate it up. It was the most attention he had paid to her in months. That was the whole point of this little retreat. Get the whole family sealed into the same spot, then work his magic. Passing down political aspirations was the key to a long, healthy reign. \n        A knock came at the cabin door. I stood and opened it. A large man in a black suit and sunglasses marred the white void. \n        \u201cHello Simon. I need to speak to the president,\u201d the man said.\n        My father appeared next to me. He stated that we were not to be disturbed. This was the one weekend we had together. He was mad. Clearly, his plan to brainwash us properly using his politician\u2019s charisma had been interrupted. But I was no drone to be manipulated, so this was more an opportunity than anything. \n        \u201cI understand sir, but this is urgent,\u201d the man said. \n        He glanced at me, then leaned in close to father and whispered something to him. Father\u2019s eyes widened. He ran into the kitchen and hugged mother. \n        \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. You all need to stay here. Something is happening. I\u2019m not sure what, but it\u2019s big. I need to be there for the people. I\u2019ll send word when I can,\u201d he said.\n        With that, my father and his assistant were swallowed by the void. \n        Time passed. We stayed in the cabin. We were supplied with food, but never transportation. Weeks passed. War was declared between our country and another across the world. It appeared that my father was not as charismatic as he had hoped. Seeing him fail, for once, was satisfying. To have it proven that he wasn\u2019t perfect felt satisfying. But then word came that he had taught the dogs of war to heel. He brokered peace. The world loved him for being the man to end the fighting. \n        No one really knew him. They knew the idea of him, not the man himself. Not the overbearing personality, the absolute assuredness, the force that was him. I thought I knew him better than he knew himself. It was only after burying him some years later that I realized I never knew him at all. \n        Assassination is a dirty word in politics. I had learned through the news of the kind of evils that every politician participated in simply by being a politician. Instigating wars for profit, quashing public sentiment for the sake of a small elite, bailing out the powerful at the cost of the weak. The news made me think he was the game. But that news was owned by the powerful, and he was marked for death by those hidden despots. He really had been helping the weak at the cost of the powerful. My adolescence ended when I realized the good my father had worked towards his whole life had gotten him killed. \n        So I returned to the cabin I had stayed at as a boy. That had been the last place we were really together. It was the site where I relished my father\u2019s distress. My greatest sin. I, like so many others, got wrapped up in the image of my father and ignored the man himself. He wasn\u2019t trying to teach us lessons on how to become good future politicians. He was trying to play a game with his children. A game that taught the lesson of just how easily corrupted a system could become. \n        I set up the game. I roll the dice, move the pieces, and make decisions. At the end, I know why I came to the cabin. \n        My father was a good man. He saw problems with the world, and used his natural charisma to convince others to help him fix them. He was a leader, a virtuous man that fought against the evils of the world. He played fair. He worked within the boundaries granted to him by the system. And he died for it. \n        I will continue what my father started. But I will not be a good man. I will do whatever it takes to see his ideals fulfilled. Hopefully, that will let me succeed where he failed before the void swallows me as well."}

I have a bottle of vino. Very cozy. Very romantic,\u201d Tony said. Maddie giggled and rubbed her hands together to warm them up. \n\tThe lock finally clicked, and Tony opened the door. \u201cVoil\u00e0! Our love - What the\u2026\u201d\n\tA smoky haze filled the one-room cabin. Embers glowed in the fireplace. Tony cautiously entered the room and tripped over a black duffle bag. \u201cMy parents are supposed to be in Pittsburgh this weekend,\u201d he said aloud, more to himself than to Maddie. \u201cMom! Dad! You here?\u201d he called out.\n\tThe sliding door leading to the back deck opened, and a shirtless man with a towel wrapped around his waist entered the room. Steam rose from his shoulders and his hairy, gray chest. He rubbed his head with another towel, trying to dry what was left of his hair. Tony grabbed a thick hardback book off of the side-table, ready to swing.\n\t\u201cHey there! You must be the new guy from accounting. We didn\u2019t think you were coming. I\u2019m Randall, nice to meet you.\u201d The man draped the towel around his shoulders and extended his hand. \u201cThe others ran to the store and were going to go on a nature hike or something to kill time while the smoke cleared. I told Pam to check the flue. Broads, amiright!\u201d\n\tTony lowered the book and gave Randall a puzzled look. Maddie peeked out from behind him. Before Tony could interrogate the stranger, a minivan pulled up to the cabin. Car doors slammed, and four people rushed to the open cabin door to escape the cold. \n\tA woman wearing an oversized red puffer coat and a Dorothy Hamill haircut, rummaged through a plastic shopping bag. \u201c...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Fifteen pine cones! I saw the cutest wreath made of pine cones online. I can\u2019t wait to start crafting!\u201d\n\tAnother woman scowled and whispered to a remarkably tall and stout man. \u201cI hope Pam doesn\u2019t draw my name in this year\u2019s secret Santa.\u201d The man chuckled.\n\tRight as Tony was about to lose it, Vicki, his parent\u2019s neighbor of twenty-five years, pushed the man and woman aside. \u201cMy sweet boy!\u201d She approached Tony, arms wide open, and squeezed him in a bear hug. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your mom said you started your new job this week.\u201d\n\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not until next week. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked.\n\tVicki raised her hand to present the group. \u201cWe\u2019re having our annual managers\u2019 retreat and quarterly planning meeting. This is Pam, Claudia, Arthur. It looks like you met Randall. Team, this is Tony and\u2026\u201d \n\tTony was not quite ready to define his relationship of three weeks, so he replied, \u201cOh, yeah. This is, um, my\u2026 Maddie.\u201d \n\t\u201cPleasure to meet you, dear.\u201d Vicki said.\n\tMaddie blushed and replied in a questioning tone, \u201cThanks?\u201d\n\t\u201cTony\u2019s parents were so generous to volunteer their cabin for our retreat. I\u2019ve known Tony since he was five years old. Our son threw a rubber snake on him the day they moved in next door. Scared the poor little guy so bad, he peed his pants!\u201d Vickie laughed.\n\t\u201cAlright, that\u2019s a great trip down memory lane. So sorry we crashed your meeting. We\u2019ll be going now. Nice to meet you.\u201d Tony put his hand on Maddie\u2019s back and gently pushed her towards the door.\n\tVicki grabbed them both by the shoulders and flipped them around. \u201cI won\u2019t have it. The roads are getting much too slick. I would never forgive myself if, Lord forbid\u2026\u201d She put her hand on her heart. \n\tPam excitedly chimed in. \u201cYeah, we got some snacks at the store, and we can always use more people for the games we have planned. Oh, we have hot chocolate and crafts. Maybe you can help us with the fireplace.\u201d \n\tMaddie looked at Tony and shrugged. \u201cIt could be fun.\u201d\n\t\u201cSure, alright. The snow is coming down pretty hard,\u201d Tony said. Pam squealed with delight.\n\tTony and Maddie placed their bags in the back corner of the cabin which didn\u2019t seem to be claimed yet. Maddie helped Vicki and Pam with the groceries. Randall emerged from the bathroom wearing a blue tracksuit. He stood over Tony, supervising him. Tony nervously looked over his shoulder, opened the fireplace damper and restarted the fire. Claudia, frowning with arms crossed, watched from the couch. Arthur nodded off and jerked awake.\n\t\u201cI hear the sales team got to go to Maui on their retreat,\u201d Claudia announced loudly.\n\t\u201cWe don\u2019t need a fancy resort to have fun. Sales is so competitive. They\u2019re nothing but drama. We\u2019re family. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll have more fun,\u201d Vicki said. \u201cNow who wants hot cocoa?\u201d\n\tArthur awoke from his nap and eagerly jumped up. \u201cMarshmallows! Yes!\u201d he exclaimed. Claudia begrudgingly took a cup. Pam pulled a bright pink binder out of her suitcase. In silver puff paint across the front, it said, \u201cMountain Retreat Activities.\u201d Although Vicki was the big boss, she generously let Pam take the reins on planning the retreat.\n\t\u201cAlright guys! Let\u2019s play our first game,\u201d Pam said, gathering the team. \n\tRandall plopped down on the fireplace hearth and feasted on a bag of gummy bears. Vicki sat a cheese-plate and a box of saltine crackers on the coffee table. All of the seats were quickly taken. Tony smirked at Maddie. She tried to contain a laugh as they settled on a sleeping bag on the floor. \n\tPam cleared her throat. \u201cOkay, I need two volunteers for our first activity.\u201d Everyone averted their eyes. Randall focused intently on his bag of gummy bears. Arthur took a sudden interest in the buttons on his watch.\n\tClaudia finally broke the silence. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\t\u201cWell,\u201d Pam said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do a skit where-\u201d\n\tClaudia made an obnoxious buzzer noise. \u201cPass!\u201d\n\tPam was taken aback. \u201cDoes anyone want\u2026\u201d She trailed off. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll circle back around to that one once we get warmed up.\u201d She flipped through her book. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s a fun one.\u201d She robotically read from the page. \"Communication skills are very important in the workplace. Clear communication helps productivity and boosts morale. For this activity, we are going to play telephone. I need three volunteers.\u201d Pam looked around the room.\n\tArthur barely raised his hand. Pam waved him up to the front of the room. \n\t\u201cYou get to leave the room for a few minutes,\u201d Pam said, looking at Claudia.\n\t\u201cFine,\u201d Claudia said as she got up. She muttered under her breath, \u201cAnything to escape.\u201d\n\tMaddie pushed Tony and mouthed, \u201cHelp her out.\u201d\n\tTony hesitantly stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\t\u201cGreat!\u201d Pam clapped enthusiastically. \u201cSo, I need Claudia and Tony to step outside.\u201d\n\tTony objected. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing out there. Couldn\u2019t we just go into the bathroom or cover our ears?\u201d\n\tClaudia had her coat on before he could finish, and threw him a blanket. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d she said. They stood on the porch and watched through the window as the team discussed the instructions. Pam furiously flipped through the pages of her binder. Vicki pulled it away from her, and put her reading glasses on.\n\t\u201cGood grief,\u201d Claudia said, and rolled her eyes.\n\t\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d Tony asked.\n\t\u201cDo what?\u201d asked Claudia.\n\t\u201cThis,\u201d he said, gesturing at the window. \u201cYou obviously hate it. Why don\u2019t you do something else?\u201d\n\tClaudia tilted her head and thought for a second. \u201cI suppose the money\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, I only have two years until I can retire. I\u2019m going to ride it out.\u201d\n\t\u201cDo you regret not doing something else?\u201d he asked.\n\t\u201cYou start a new job next week?\u201d she asked. Tony nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019re having second thoughts?\u201d Tony looked at the ground. \u201cWhat do you really want to do?\u201d\n\tTony kicked a pine cone around and thought for a moment. He looked up at Claudia and said, \u201cI always wanted to be a pilot. Training\u2019s expensive, though, and-\u201d\n\t\u201cDo it!\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want to be stuck in the mountains for the rest of your life playing reindeer games with crazy people?\u201d Tony smiled. \u201cDo it!\u201d\n\tPam popped her head out the door. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d\n\t\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Tony said. Claudia went in, and watched the group argue through the window. His breath fogged the glass, and he wiped it off. They finally waved him in. \n\tHe entered, and Claudia immediately spouted out, \u201cThere\u2019s a fire on the second floor. Carla called 911. Exit through the north doors. What did I just say?\u201d \n\tTony furrowed his brow. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire on the second floor. Carla called 911. Exit through the north doors?\u201d he responded.\n\t\u201cHuh. Wow. Everyone got that exactly right. We must\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201d Pam flipped through the binder. \n\t\u201cMaybe they should whisper next time,\u201d Maddie suggested. Everyone nodded in agreement. \n\t\u201cI guess we just have great communication! Way to go!\u201d Vicki pumped up the group and gave Pam a nod of approval.\n\tPam cleared a path in front of the coffee table. \u201cTrust fall time! Let\u2019s gather around the coffee table. Who wants to go first?\u201d\n\t\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Claudia objected. She grabbed a book and locked herself in the bathroom. \n\t\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go,\u201d Arthur said.\n\t\u201cMaybe we should start with someone a little, um, smaller,\u201d Tony said.\n\tPam ignored Tony\u2019s suggestion and helped Arthur up on the coffee table. \u201cNow, everyone, grab hands in the center and form a trust circle. On the count of three, fall backwards, Arthur. Don\u2019t worry, you can trust us.\u201d\n\t\u201cGuys, we should probably discuss this,\u201d Tony said as Pam pulled his hands to the center.\n\tArthur made the sign of the cross and folded his arms across his chest. The group counted, not quite in unison, \u201cOne! Two! Three!\u201d Arthur fell backwards, and instinctively, everyone moved out of the way. Everyone except Tony, who broke his fall and slammed his head on the fireplace hearth in the process.\n\tTony grabbed his head, and opened his eyes. He let out a startled scream at the six people leaning over him. \u201cHe\u2019s alive! He\u2019s alive!\u201d Vicki cried out.\n\t\u201cW-what? Where? What happened?\u201d Tony tried to sit up, but Maddie put her hand on his chest and grabbed his arm, \n\t\u201cDon\u2019t move! You\u2019ve been out for, like, five minutes. An ambulance is on the way,\u201d she said.\n\tTony pushed his way up. His eyes began to focus on the concerned faces watching him. He looked deep into Claudia\u2019s icy blue eyes. Her voice played over and over in his head, Do it! Do it! Do it!\n\tHe reached out. \u201cI need\u2026 I need my\u2026\u201d He snapped his fingers trying to remember. \u201cMy phone. Where\u2019s my phone?\u201d\n\tRandall picked up  the phone which had landed, surprisingly unscathed, in the kitchen and handed it to him. Tony gathered himself for a moment and composed an email. In his head, he wrote, \u201cThank you for the opportunity to work at ProtoTech. However, I have decided to pursue other professional opportunities. I hope that we can work together in the future.\u201d \n\tUnfortunately, there was a disconnect between his brain and his fingers, and he actually wrote. \u201cim nver comng to wirk. i fly now. tanks.\u201d Either way, he communicated his message.\n\tThe team waved at Tony as he was loaded into the ambulance. Maddie climbed in the back with him. \n\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, dear. Please don\u2019t sue us!\u201d Vicki shouted as the doors closed.\n\tThe red and blue lights reflected off the blanket of snow, and the siren echoed through the mountains. Tony closed his eyes. Perhaps, it was him that got the most out of the annual managers' retreat and quarterly planning meeting. \n"}
{"example_id":"example_093","inputs":"Write a story that takes place in a remote cabin in snowy mountains. The story should be written from a third-person, omniscient point of view. Word count should be 1800 to 1900 words. The protagonist watches a small shuttle arrive. Two wardens emerge and tell the protagonist that his appeal will not be heard. He is a prisoner, sentenced to life alone in a cabin on the asteroid. They leave him with an AI for company. The man and the AI become friends. When the wardens return they tell him new evidence has cleared him and he is to be free. He wants to take the AI, but AI is not allowed on earth. A warden shoots the AI and the three men leave the asteroid. ","targets":"        In the heart of snowy mountains, where the world is blanketed in a pristine layer of cold\u2019s embrace, there exists a solitary cabin. Amid the tranquil hush of snow-laden pines, a man resides alone, a silent sentinel to the beauty and solitude that define his existence.\n        As moonlight filters through the frost-kissed windows, casting a soft glow on the worn wooden floors, the man becomes a part of the winter night\u2019s tapestry. A thin mattress has a threadbare blanket draped over it. A single table occupies the center, with a single bowl and cup upon it.\n        The crackling fire in the hearth dances with shadows on the walls, creating a haven against the cold. Weathered hands, scarred by the passage of time and the labor of survival, carefully tend to the flames. He wears a thick coat of rabbit pelts draped around his shoulders.\n        A weary smile crossed the face of Prisoner 227 when a kaleidoscope of lights played upon the windows and the walls. Prisoner 227 went to the door and opened it to the frigid expanse.\n        A shuttle hovered in the air near the rooftop, with the rhythmic sounds of snowflakes striking the roof and the shuttle hull. It settles into a clearing nearby, and two men in matching black uniforms emerge carrying boxes. A cottontail sprinted across the ground in front of them.\n        Inside the cabin, the first man, a thinner, shorter man with dark hair and a scarred face, pulled off his gloves and settled into the cabin\u2019s lone chair, padded with thick layers of rabbit pelts. The second man knelt before the fireplace and stoked the fire. \n        Prisoner 227 opened the boxes and pulled out canned vegetables and fruits. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, observing each man in turn.\n        The seated man brushes his hand through his hair. \u201cPrisoner 227, I am Warden Smith, and this,\u201d Smith said, indicating the other man, \u201cis Warden Jax. I have come to give you news on the first anniversary of your sentence. Your request for an appeal has been denied. No appeals will be heard. You will serve the penalty for the charges here on Asteroid 7-Iris.\u201d\n        Prisoner 227 wobbled at the table, steadying himself with both hands. \u201cI am innocent.\u201d\n        Warden Jax stood, adjusted his long coat, and took a step toward Prisoner 227, leaning toward him menacingly. \u201cYour crimes have been judged.\u201d\n        Warden Smith raised a hand, and Warden Jax settled back on his heels. \u201c We will return every orbit on the anniversary of your incarceration with provisions.\u201d \n        \u201cBut we\u2019re not leaving you with nothing.\u201d Warden Smith reached into a small bag at his side, producing a silver orb the size of a large orange in the palm of his hand. \u201cWe are leaving you with an AI. This one is called Cato.\u201d\n        The orb pulsed with a blue hue and elevated itself to eye level. A single black lens seemed to focus on each warden before turning to the prisoner. \"Hello, Prisoner 227,\u201d the orb said, in a smooth feminine voice. \n        Warden Smith put his gloves back on as he smiled at Cato. \"She can help in a variety of ways. She can communicate and has an archive of stories and songs, though they are not endless. This is a prison, after all. But most importantly, she can be company for you.\u201d\n        Prisoner 227 stared at Cato for a long moment. \u201cMy name is Carl.\u201d\n        \u201cVery good, Carl. How may I help you?\u201d The orb bobbed gently in the air.\n        Carl glanced at the fireplace. \u201cThe fire is going out. Can you help?\u201d\n        The orb turned its eye to the fireplace. A shimmering blue hue focused on the fire, and the dying embers flickered into roaring flames. \n        Warden Smith and Warden Jax stepped back into the cold and boarded the shuttle without looking back. \n        The next morning, Carl awoke on his thin mattress and turned to see the orb floating a few feet from where he laid his head.\n        \u201cStill here?\u201d Carl asked.\n        The orb pulsed its blue color. \u201cMy designation is here.\u201d\n        Carl sat up, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cAnd do you know where here is?\u201d\n        \u201cAsteroid 7-Iris is the fourth-brightest object in the asteroid belt.\u201d\n          Carl looked at the two boxes of provisions on his table. \n        \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to put things away,\u201d he said, standing up.\n        Cato hovered before his eyes. \u201cI would have lit a fire, but there is no wood.\u201d\n        Carl saw that his rack for storing wood indeed sat empty. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n        Cato drifted toward the table, and its blue beam stretched toward the boxes. Two of the jars lifted out of one box and drifted towards a shelf under the nearest window. \u201cGo and get some firewood. I\u2019ll put the provisions away and make breakfast.\u201d\n        Carl blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to cook for me?\u201d\n        Cato turned its single eye toward him. \u201cYou need calories to operate. I detect cracks in the walls of the cabin and roof that need to be patched. A section of the foundation in the southeast corner needs repairing, and my long range sensors detect at least three trees with limbs that need to be cut back that could put the roof in danger.\u201d Cato turned back to the boxes and lifted two more cans to the shelf.\n        \u201cWhat the hell do you care about any of that?\u201d\n        Cato didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cIf the cabin fails, you die. Then I will have no further purpose.\u201d\n        Within a couple of hours, Carl had hauled in three armfuls of wood for the fire and three dead rabbits. \n        Cato kept a good fire going that kept the cabin warm every time he returned. \n        Carl roasted a rabbit over a spit that evening and ate it as he spooned fruit from a jar, watching Cato.\n        The orb moved another log into the fire, nudged the flames higher, and then began to hum a tune.\n        \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Carl asked.\n        \u201cI\u2019m singing. Do you like it?\u201d Cato bobbed gently in the air, a few feet from the fire, its eye facing the flames.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Carl muttered, and then he went back to eating.\n        Carl, exhausted from a day of labor, eventually rose from the dinner table and went to bed exhausted.\n        When Carl awoke the next morning, he sat up and noticed that the table had been cleared. He threw back the blankets and stood up, alarmed. \u201cWhat happened to my dish?\u201d\n        Cato glowed brightly in the pre-dawn light. \u201cI washed it and put it away.\u201d\n        Carl worked the next several days, cutting down the nearest trees for kindling and repairing the cracks in the walls and roof. During the day, Cato organized the food and kept the fire going.\n        Cato showed Carl how to make fruit wine from the canned fruit provided to him. After a few glasses of wine, Carl would smile and sway to the rhythms, and so the AI learned what songs Carl enjoyed. One night, Carl started to sing along.\n        Just before laying his head down to slumber, Carl recognized the cabin as his prison, and sadness would overcome him.\n        When the weather became less severe, Carl could remain outdoors most of the day. The two of them would circle the frozen lake, marveling at the craggy, terraformed peaks of pine and fir. Carl shared experiencing the beauty of sunsets and sunrises with Cato. He showed it how the sun climbed down the mountains to swim in the frozen lake, a lake that paints different pictures every day.\n        A year passed, and the shuttle returned. Wardens Smith and Jax appeared once again. They settled into the cabin, finding drapes on the windows, a thick blanket of pelts on the bed, two more chairs built for the table, and a basket of aromatic pine cones set in the center amid bunches of sandwort. Carl wore thick boots, and had a rug before the fire made of rabbit pelts. Carl poured the wardens each a glass of fruit wine.\n        Warden Smith took a drink and smiled. \u201cYou seem to be doing fine, Prisoner 227. The cabin is warm. You are well-clothed and well-fed.\u201d\n        \u201cI am a bit sick of rabbits,\u201d Carl said with a smile.\n        \u201cWell, I bring good news, Prisoner 227.\u201d Warden Smith smiled at Carl and glanced at Warden Jax. Warden Jax tapped his fingers on the table, glowering. \u201cYou had no appeal. However, a recent prosecution has uncovered evidence that brought your charges to light. Someone else, it seems, is responsible for your crimes. The High Judges have vacated your sentence.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m to be set free?\u201d Carl asked, eyes wide, body shaking.\n        Warden Jax checked his watch and stood up. \u201cThe asteroid will only be at its perigee for another hour before the Roche limit. We have to begin to return to our vessel in five minutes.\u201d\n        Carl whirled about in the cabin. He grabbed a sack made from rabbit pelts and began to put the few books and personal items he had arrived with into the bag. He grabbed a jar of peach wine, then decided against it. \n        Pulling on his thick boots, he called out. \u201cCato, let\u2019s go.\u201d He opened the bag and looked around the room for the orb. \n        \u201cI can\u2019t go with you, Carl.\u201d The voice came from overhead.\n        Carl looked up to see Cato hovering near the ceiling. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n        \u201cMy designation is here, Carl. This is what I am meant to do.\u201d\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t want to stay here?\u201d Carl\u2019s voice rises as he stands.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay, but I have no choice.\u201d\n        The door opens, and Warden Smith is standing there. \u201cReady?\u201d he asks.\n        Carl approaches the Warden. \u201cTell Cato it can come too.\u201d\n        Warden Smith\u2019s lip curls, his eyes finding the orb. \u201cI am sorry. Since you've been gone, AI has been forbidden on earth.\u201d \n        \u201cNo.\u201d Carl looks at Cato, then back at Warden Smith. \u201cI can\u2019t leave Cato,\u201d he pleads.\n        Warden Jax took out a pistol and shot the AI. The bullet pierced the frame, and it fell to the floor. \n        Carl rushed over. The blue hue pulsed, then slowed. \n        \u201cYou will survive,\u201d said Cato. \u201cYou will go on. I feel no excitement, adrenaline rush, or even pride, but only fear of loneliness.\u201d Then the light faded out.\n        Carl took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly, before he rose and joined Wardens Smith and Jax in the shuttle. \n        Warden Smith looked over his shoulder at Carl as the shuttle rose. \u201cThere have been a lot of outcries about sending prisoners to the asteroids. You are one of the last ones. It\u2019s an existence judged to be inhumane.\u201d \n        Carl watched as they departed the asteroid and the cabin, the terraformed mountains fading away. \u201cYes, too inhumane,\u201d he whispered softly."}
{"example_id":"example_094","inputs":"Write a story that takes place in a remote cabin in snowy mountains. The story should be between 1900-2000 words. The story should center around Jamie, who lives in a cabin in the mountains. Jamie is married to her husband, Ryan. She is a remote professor of religious studies and Ryan is a woodworker. One evening, as Jamie is making tea, their dog Prince hears and sees something outside. Jamie takes Prince outside, where they find a small fox pup behind a tree - cold and hurt. Jamie brings the fox inside. Ryan is hesitant at first but quickly warms up to the fox. They name the fox Ginger. They nurse Ginger back to health and when summer arrives, they have to let him go. Six months later, as snow begins to fall again, Ginger makes a surprise return with his own four pups. ","targets":"     Jamie sat at her desk, gently tapping away at her keyboard, looking out of the large arched window of the log cabin. The snow was fresh and fluffy, leaving a crystal-white glow across the wooded landscape. \n     \u201cI love the way the mountains look when it snows. Everything turns soft, even the sharp peaks,\u201d Jamie said to Ryan.\n     \u201cWell, that\u2019s one reason we moved here, isn\u2019t it? So you could see snow most of the year?\u201d Ryan responded.\n     Jamie and Ryan had been married for four years and bought the cabin a year into their marriage. Buying a house in the city and suburbs proved to be a difficult task, and Jamie, in her many attempts to escape uniformity, had always wanted to live somewhere hidden. Ryan made his living woodworking, and Jamie was a remote college professor in religious studies. She spent her days going over lesson plans and grading papers. She had, inexplicably, fallen into the monotonous, daily routine that she had been trying to avoid.\n     The sun began to set, radiating a golden cast across the pines and the porcelain-white snow. Jamie walked down the creaky stairs into the living room, where Ryan sat watching some obscure 90s television show. Their living room was small and cozy; the walls were built with light hickory wood, and the fireplace was surrounded by deep-red brick and stone. On the floor lay a faded, woven red and off-white rug adorning a kaleidoscope pattern. Their border collie, Prince, slept next to the crackling fireplace, his long black and white fur spreading out across the floor. Jamie walked into the kitchen and placed a kettle with peppermint tea on the stovetop.\n     \u201cWant some tea?\u201d she yelled to Ryan as the burner began to light up. \n     He didn\u2019t answer. \n     She walked over and sat on the plush, green couch, the TV now glowing in her face, too. Jamie glanced at Ryan quickly, then looked out of the glass French doors that led to their backyard. The snow began to softly drift from the sky again, dancing towards the ground. Prince, who had been sleeping peacefully for hours, suddenly perked up with an inquisitive look. His ears were so high, it looked like he might fly away. He started to pant, his rough, pinkish tongue hanging out. His tail began to wag as he ran to the back door.\n     \u201cGuess I\u2019ll take Prince out,\u201d Jamie said, standing up from the couch and walking back into the kitchen. She poured the tea from the steaming kettle into a white tumbler that had a cartoonish-looking dog, fully embodying Prince, on the front. She slipped on her black snow boots, one by one, and then put on her blue puffer jacket. Prince started to bark, the bottom portion of his body wiggling energetically.\n     \u201cOkay, okay, boy. I\u2019m coming.\u201d\n     Jamie opened the creaking door and stepped outside, standing underneath the light on the porch and taking sips of her warm tea. Prince ran out into the yard, the snow landing on his long black coat and his white belly turning wet with frozen vapor. He stood by a large tree and started barking into the distance. The sky was navy blue, a sheet of stars lying above the crystal mountain.\n     \u201cPrince? What\u2019s going on?\u201d \n     Jamie stepped off the cherry-wood porch, wading through the snow to get to Prince. He started to jump around, bending his mouth like he was smiling at something. Jamie took out her phone and turned the flashlight on, stepping in front of Prince, the snow crunching underneath her. The bright, blinding flashlight revealed something Jamie had never seen before \u2014an orange-red tail sticking out from behind a tree, drenched in wet snow. Jamie rounded the corner and came across the full picture: a small, cold red fox pup. Its sphere-like eyes were large and sad, and the expression on its face was sorrowful and somber. Jamie, in an act of fearlessness, took off a glove and held her hand out, placing it underneath the small animal\u2019s black nose. It sniffed her palm, then looked into her eyes with a bit of glimmering hope. \n     Jamie removed her jacket, wrapped it around the small fox, and picked him up, his thin body feeling so fragile in her arms. \n     \u201cCome on, little one, let\u2019s get you warm.\u201d\n      Prince jumped on Jamie, sniffing the fox. \n      \u201cI\u2019m going to name you Ginger,\u201d Jamie said, walking back to her porch. She tapped on the door with one knuckle, still holding Ginger tightly. Ryan looked out and hopped up fast, not knowing what Jamie was hiding underneath her coat. He opened the door, and jumped back.\n     \u201cAh! What, what, what - what is that thing?\u201d He fumbled. \n     \u201cI found him underneath the oak tree. Well, actually, Prince found him. He\u2019s cold and feels thin. He might be hurt. I named him Ginger.\u201d\n     \u201cYou named him? You know you\u2019re not supposed to do that. They say that\u2019s how you get attached.\u201d\n     \u201cBut look, Ginger is the perfect name for him, isn\u2019t it? I figured we\u2019ll just make sure that he gets some food and gets warm, and then we\u2019ll let him back out.\u201d\n     \u201cJamie, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n     \u201cPlease, Ryan? I can\u2019t let him back out like this. The snow is only supposed to get worse. Please?\u201d\n     Ryan looked outside. The snow had started to fall furiously. The wind was brisk and blustery. \n     \u201cOkay, okay, fine. But only until the snow lets up. And if he bites anyone or hurts Prince in any way, he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n     Jamie looked at Ryan gratefully.\n     \u201cCan you set up some blankets by the fireplace for him?\u201d\n     Jamie sat down on the couch with Ginger. Prince jumped next to them and licked the pup behind his ears while Ryan rushed to find some packed-away blankets in the hall closet. The old gray fleece blanket was pilling up with small fuzzballs, but Ryan grabbed it anyway. He placed it on the floor by the fireplace and then added some plush towels on top. Jamie put Ginger on the soft wrappings and headed to the kitchen to get bowls of water and food. \n     \u201cCan foxes eat dog food?\u201d\n     \u201cI dunno. This is your experiment,\u201d Ryan responded, somewhat annoyed, but sitting next to Ginger and patting his head anyway. Jamie pulled out her phone and did a quick search.\n     \u201cUhm, looks like they can have some wet food, no kibble,\u201d she responded. \u201cI think we have wet food in the laundry room.\u201d Jamie darted to the laundry room, grabbed the food, and came back to the kitchen, placing it in a dog bowl. She brought the two bowls over to Ginger and Ryan, placing them down in front of the blankets.\n     Ginger sniffed at each one, then started chomping at the food, followed by big slurps of water. Jamie sat down next to him and pet his back as he continued to eat, enjoying every last morsel. \n     \u201cMaybe we should call a vet tomorrow,\u201d Jamie said, noticing a small laceration on his paw. \n      Ryan stood up and walked into the bathroom, opened the medicine cabinet, and came back out. \n     \u201cHere, let\u2019s do this for now,\u201d he said, wrapping some gauze around the wound. After Ginger had a full belly, he curled back up and went to sleep.\n     Jamie awoke on the couch in the morning to the fire that was now an ember, and a fresh blanket of snow outside. Prince was scampering around Ginger, their claws clacking on the hardwood floor. Ginger was trying to keep up, although his hurt foot gave him a slight delay. Jamie walked into the kitchen with the blanket wrapped around her, started the coffee pot, fed the two pups, and called a mobile vet.\n     The veterinarian was an older gentleman, Larry, who had lived in the mountains since he started his practice, and was well-equipped to traverse mountainous snow. He took a look at Ginger\u2019s paw. \n     \u201cThis will get infected if it\u2019s not taken care of,\u201d Larry said. \u201cHe needs to be watched until his paw is fully healed, and he has a bit more weight on him. Here, put this on his paw twice a day and make sure it stays clean.\u201d He handed Jamie a tube of antibacterial ointment, some antibiotic medication, and some disposable bandages. \n     \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Jamie responded gratefully.\n     \u201cAlright, no need to pay anything today. I\u2019ll bill you,\u201d Larry said, quickly opening up the door and leaving. \n     Jamie put the ointment on Ginger\u2019s wound, wrapped the covering around it, and then hid the antibiotic in his food. He ate it up, never knowing the difference. \n     As time went on, Ginger started to heal and grow. The cut on his paw was closing up cleanly, and his little body was becoming rounder each day. He and Prince would run outside among the melting snow, oaks, and evergreens, Ginger now being able to rival Prince\u2019s speed.\n     By the time the summer heat arrived, it was time for the little family to say goodbye to Ginger, letting him off into the world on his own. Jamie, crying, gave the small pup a hug and said soft farewells. Ryan placed his arm around his wife as they watched Ginger scamper into the thicket. \n     \u201cYou did what you had to do,\u201d he whispered. \n      \u201cI know,\u201d she responded, sorrowfully. \n      Six months later, as the sky started to fill with precipitation once again, Jamie and Ryan were sitting on the couch, curling up, listening to some old records that Ryan\u2019s dad had given them as a wedding present. White flakes began to slowly fall as the music started to play \u201cMoonlight Serenade.\u201d \n     Prince, lying on the floor by the fireplace, perked up when he heard a  scratch coming from outside. Jamie quickly ran to the door and stood outside. She looked around and there, out in the distance, stood Ginger, staring at the woman who had nursed him back to health all those months ago. Poking out behind him were four smaller pups. Laughing, Jamie opened the backdoor.\n     \u201cRyan! Bring out some meat and wet dog food! Hurry!\u201d\n     Jamie stepped into the backyard, and Prince followed. She knelt down in front of Ginger and his pups, letting them sniff her palms and jump on her shoulders, licking her face. She didn\u2019t care that it was snowing or how cold it was outside. This moment, to Jamie, meant everything.\n     \u201cI guess this means you\u2019re a grandma,\u201d Ryan said as he brought out the food and placed it down in front of the pack.\n     Jamie and Ryan grabbed their coats quickly from inside and sat on the dark, wicker rocking chairs outside of their living room. They watched as Ginger and Prince reunited and became acquainted with the much smaller and more energetic pups\u2014hopping, playing, jumping, barking\u2014enjoying prancing in the snow. When playtime was over, Ginger gathered his pack and began the tread back to his den. His pups trailed in front of him as he stopped for a moment, turned around, and looked at Jamie. A tear fell from her eye as she nodded her head and waved at the dear creature. \n     Now, on summer, spring, fall, and winter evenings, especially the nights when the sky turns gray and frozen water begins to fall, Ginger and his pups visit their human family, and Jamie is always there, in her snowy mountain cabin, waiting to greet them.\n"}

","targets":"        My family\u2019s cabin in rural Colorado was my favorite part of winter when I was growing up, especially during our annual holiday vacation. It would snow for weeks by the time we\u2019d arrive, and the impossibly long drive through icy mountain roads was always worth it when I saw how much snow we\u2019d get to play in. I looked forward to two weeks chalk-full of cozy nights, snowball fights, and quality time with my dad and my little brother, Alex. I relished every moment there \u2013 apart from the nights the ghost family came to visit. \n        That\u2019s a bit harsh. I didn\u2019t have a problem with the ghost family themselves, it was just a difficult process to know how to accommodate them and how to act in their presence. My dad would give us a yearly reminder that they didn\u2019t choose to visit us, the same way we didn\u2019t choose to host them. If they had to come every year, we should at least make it a pleasant experience.\n        As much effort as we\u2019d put into it every year, it was never clear whether they were having a \u2018pleasant experience\u2019. They didn\u2019t speak and never really changed expressions; they\u2019d come, sit with us in the living room, float around the house, and eventually depart after midnight. They\u2019d exit in the same way they\u2019d entered, single file, in somber silence. The ghost family nearly mirrored ours: a father, a mother, a son, and a daughter. All that was missing on our end was our mother. \n        It was my mom\u2019s family\u2019s cabin, passed down through generations. She\u2019d only come with us for one cabin vacation before she passed, the year she inherited the property. It was still our best visit that I can remember, even years later. It snowed that Christmas morning. She cooked us pancakes almost every morning and read us stories every night until we fell asleep.\n        Returning to the cabin was its own difficult task. With it being her family\u2019s cabin, her absence was impossible to overlook\u2014especially since she\u2019d been the one to instruct us on how to \u201cproperly\u201d host the ghosts our first time visiting as a family. She never shared the reason behind these annual visits, insisting we\u2019d have to wait until we were older. In the meantime, we were old enough to learn about ghosts.\n        They knocked three times on our door the night of December twenty-eighth. That first night, my mother opened the door wide and greeted them as if they were neighbors or extended family. Dad would go on to do the same for the rest of our vacations.\n        I\u2019ll never forget how scared I was that first night, frozen in fear at my mom\u2019s side, watching the vaporous outline of their legs float motionlessly past us single-file. They were all a pale, translucent blue with a dim glow. They each looked equally distressed, their expressions ranging from terrified to mournful.\n        The ghost of the father, with a long brown beard covered in thick clumps of ice that never melted, would always sit on our leather couch. He\u2019d stay there for hours on end, staring into the wall, sometimes groaning in low, grievous moans. The mother would float back and forth through the living room, eyebrows knit in deep frustration, occasionally wringing her quivering hands as she paced. The son and daughter sat listless on the floor, but sometimes moved around nine or ten o\u2019clock to sit beside their dad.\n        The children\u2019s faces were the hardest to look at, maybe since in our first year there, I was too young to comprehend why they couldn\u2019t cheer up. \n        It\u2019s the holidays, I thought. I wondered if they\u2019d be happier if Alex and I tried to play with them.\n        We\u2019d never get to try. The two of us were instructed to sit in silence while the ghosts were around.\n        While we\u2019d had quiet moments as a family alone while reading or watching television, the atmosphere of being surrounded by ghosts was not only physically colder, but oppressively melancholy. As a six-year-old at the time, sitting around was the last thing I wanted to do for an entire evening.\n        I remember my mother insisting that we couldn\u2019t read, watch TV, or even talk during their visit. We had to honor their grief, she said. These rules were nearly impossible to accept for my three-year-old brother and me. We were given constant shushes and often pulled into other rooms to have their reasoning re-explained to us. \n        \u201cThey\u2019re grieving,\u201d my mom had told me. \u201cThey\u2019re really, really sad.\u201d \n        I didn\u2019t know what grief or grieving was, but I couldn\u2019t imagine it\u2019d be important enough to waste an entire night sitting and doing nothing. In the unavoidable ennui, I envisioned myself rising up from my body as a ghost, joining the other family with an eternally bored expression. \n        Far too soon, I\u2019d learn about grief. While I was very young when my mom passed, I\u2019ll never forget the confusion and the tears of adjustment. Returning to the cabin as if everything were normal was impossible; during some of our happiest moments, my brother and I would grow suddenly plaintive and depressed. Her absence was painful and pervasive, but we\u2019d slowly learn to accept the change.                 \n        Sometimes, it helped to sit in the silence of our sadness like ghosts.\n        Despite my increased understanding of the ghost family\u2019s struggle, I would come to resent their visits. It was hard enough at times to be in our mom\u2019s family cabin without her. The last thing we needed was an entire evening of our annual two-week vacation dedicated to sitting with ghosts in unbearable silence. \n        Even when we\u2019d done our best to enjoy ourselves, their arrival would spoil the moment. Years later, the three of us were in the middle of a round of rummy, a card game I wasn\u2019t very good at. I was finally starting to win when I heard their loud knock. They\u2019d come at the same time every year, but even if I were to forget their annual visit, the weight of the knock sounded in such a heavy, ominous echo that it could never be mistaken for anyone else.\n        \u201cWhy do they have to come tonight?\u201d I cried in my sudden agitation, and quickly, dad put his finger to his lips, throwing his playing cards in the discard pile as he went to answer the door.\n        I remember tears prickling the corners of my eyes, so frustrated that our wonderful night would be snuffed out by these unhappy visitors. Why did they keep coming back if they didn\u2019t even want to be there? By our early teens, Alex and I still weren\u2019t told the reason for their annual visits, we only knew for certain that something awful happened.\n        I would\u2019ve tried to reason with my father, but he told me we should respect them and keep the necessary silence. He echoed our mother\u2019s words.\n        \u201cThey\u2019re grieving,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through a lot.\u201d\n        I wanted to help them. The rare times I\u2019d try talking to them, whenever dad reluctantly permitted it, they never responded. It seemed like they couldn\u2019t really see us, appearing only vaguely aware of our presence.\n        Two more years went by, and finally I decided to take my chance on altering our family tradition, but only after I\u2019d learned the truth about their tragedy. Having both reached our teens, Alex and I asked again what the family\u2019s story was. Finally, Dad shared all that he knew. \n        In the late eighteen-hundreds, the family had left their home to travel northbound, headed towards family in Wyoming. They unknowingly embarked right before one of the worst blizzards in Colorado history. Their damaged wagon was discovered near the cabin, though finding shelter hadn\u2019t been enough to save them from the brutality of the storm. \n        Every year they return on the alleged night of the wagon crash, always at seven thirty-three, seemingly to re-enact their evening of terrifying uncertainty. My mom\u2019s side of the family theorized that this was the only way the ghosts could process the tragedy, and instructed our family to continue hosting them so they could do so.\n        While I wanted to delicately suggest that their process wasn\u2019t working, my father didn\u2019t take well to bad attitudes about the ghost family. I understood the need for our reverence. After all, it was only once a year that we had to see them. Still, I began to raise the argument that we should go about our lives as normal when they came to visit.\n        Dad was never sold. He was always convinced it might anger or distress the ghosts if we were to celebrate in front of them. \n        \u201cThey might like it!\u201d I insisted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019d enjoy watching us have fun or even try to join in. It could remind them of the better times they shared. Has anyone ever tried?\u201d\n        My father, running a hand through his thinning brown hair, shook his head. It was only a few hours until their annual arrival. \n        \u201cI don\u2019t know, hon. Your mother always said we shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019d do if we provoked them.\u201d\n         \u201cWe\u2019ll just talk amongst ourselves or play a game. I think if we just minded our own business, they\u2019d do the same. They don\u2019t seem to notice us as it is.\u201d\n        Alex interjected an agreeable \u2018yeah!' after tuning into the conversation from his place on the leather couch. Dad looked at him, then glanced back at me. \n        While I could tell he was unconvinced, I watched him shrug.\n        \u201cI mean, we can try it,\u201d he finally agreed. \u201cBut if anything bad happens, we stop right then and there.\u201d \n        That evening, we ate dinner, played games, and joked around with abandon. When we heard that familiar knock, we let them in while \u201cSilent Night\u201d played softly in the background from my speaker. The ghost family didn\u2019t seem to notice the difference, and I grew increasingly hopeful as the minutes passed.\n         We kept our conversation going. For a while, we were talking about Mom.\n        \u201cMom was so bad at rummy,\u201d Dad remembered with a smile. \u201cShe needed a million refreshers every time on how the game was played, but they never did her any good.\u201d\n        Alex and I laughed, taking turns removing ornaments from the Christmas tree and putting them in a large cardboard box. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d let her win,\u201d Alex admitted, \u201cJust to get her mood back up. She\u2019d get so annoyed!\u201d\n        The ghosts sat in their same positions, but they didn\u2019t seem as brooding anymore. It looked like they were simply staying quiet. The mother, though she paced back and forth between us and Dad, didn\u2019t wring her hands. I wondered if I was simply hoping they were less somber, but I reminded myself to try not to focus on the ghosts.\n        After Alex and I finished, we all played a round of rummy, and I felt our group atmosphere relax again. We were laughing and reminiscing as if we were all alone. \n        To the aghast groans of my brother and dad, I finally won the round. When I turned around to check on the other family, I noticed that they\u2019d slightly faded in their glow. The mother, now no longer pacing, sat beside the rest of her family on the leather couch. I'd never seen her do that before. \n        We reshuffled the cards, and I waited before turning back around to look at them closely. I squinted to discern the lines of their ghostly bodies.\n        Though faint, I could make out their changed expressions. Ever so slightly, they were smiling.\n"}

Among all the sentients in all the realms of existence, perhaps one in a billion even has the potential to move from realm to realm within the multiverse. Even fewer realize that potential strongly enough to do it at will.\n\tFor those who do figure out how to jump from world to world, the Coalition finds us and trains us how to use that ability safely. Of course, there are fundamental things, like making sure the atmosphere is safe for you and your gear. But once a world-jumper determines whether a world can support our kind of life, jumping to that world is only the first step. The Coalition also teaches us how to immerse ourselves in the sensations of the world, both to find it again and to familiarize ourselves with any quirks of the environment. Sight and sound are important, but smell and touch can give us information that will often mark a world as unique.\n\tMost of us end up joining the Coalition, not because we\u2019re forced to, but because we\u2019ll be with people who understand what we can do.\n\tOn one of my first journeys, I landed on a world that the Coalition named Aster Five Nine. It seemed suitable for an oxygen-breather like myself, but the plants produced a sweet-smelling, psychoactive pollen that led to some very interesting effects that lingered for a few days, even after I jumped back to Zero Point, the Consortium\u2019s headquarters. \n\tFor that time, I saw sounds as colors, heard smells as distinct musical notes, and tasted color. Low pitches were a deep, dark crimson, while higher pitches went more toward violet. Sweeter smells were mostly pleasant higher pitched sounds, but bitter and sour smells were either sharp or flat notes. And I\u2019m not sure why certain colors, like blue or yellow, corresponded to a sweet, tangy taste or a faintly sour one, respectively. And I know people spoke to me while I was still affected, but all I experienced were hues exploding from them in a variety of shapes. \n\tI was more careful after that; other world-jumpers found the environment stimulating, but I wasn\u2019t interested in repeating the experience.\n\tThis time, I was preparing to jump to a completely new world for the Exploration Team. Stable worlds that were safe for oxygen-breathing mammals like myself were far more uncommon than I\u2019d realized when the Coalition first found me. Most of the sentients occupying the various domed environments of Zero Point found oxygen difficult to metabolize or were adversely affected by it.\n\tThe corridor to the transit dome for oxygen breathers was wide enough to accommodate sentients from a variety of different worlds; in my world, I would have said it was perhaps twenty feet across. The cream-colored walls were designed with deliberate care for sentients who relied on sight-based senses, and they were both durable and smooth to fit the needs of more touch-oriented beings. The lighting was bright enough for beings to see each other without being harsh or intrusive; it mirrored the yellow sunlight of my homeworld quite well. I was about halfway to the transit dome for oxygen breathers when one of the other sentients I\u2019d trained with floated into view.\n\tV\u2019niss looked like a slightly flattened dome of semi-clear gel with ten thicker tendril-arms and a number of thinner tentacles. Several shapes in varying pinkish-red hues, corresponding more or less to organs in my body, floated within the gel, and five darker spots around the surface of their dome were their equivalent of eyes. They used the name V\u2019niss so that those of us not born in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant could address them properly. V\u2019niss and their species communicated almost exclusively with color changes to their primary body and movements of their primary tendril-arms, far more useful in the roaring winds of their homeworld than sound ever would have been. Once we\u2019d gotten over the shock of our respective forms, we\u2019d become good friends.\n\tV\u2019niss\u2019 species used technology to translate their words, while mine used magic. Together, these tools allowed us to communicate. I bowed in greeting, and they flexed their primary tendrils in response. I\u2019m not sure what occurred at their end, but translation magic always tingled a bit inside my head, toward the back of my brain.\n\t\u201cFriend Jayce,\u201d they said, \u201cour team wishes you well on your exploration. Please do not inhale substances that will cause you harm.\u201d Their tone was humorous, or so my translation magic assured me. By now, I\u2019d gotten used to the fact that for species who didn\u2019t use sound to communicate, translation magic simply made the words and tone manifest inside my mind, as though we were using telepathy. \n\t\u201cNo, friend V\u2019niss, I will simply collect them so you and your team can experience them in your leisure time.\u201d I made sure that my tone also conveyed humor, and the flattened dome that constituted their core flashed in colors of delight and amusement. They then floated away, signaling with color and gesture that they\u2019d only intended to come over and tease me. I thought again how the people I\u2019d grown up with would react to V\u2019niss: they\u2019d see a flying jellyfish, and probably would either run screaming or try to attack. \n\tWhen I arrived at the transit dome, a starscape, unlike anything I\u2019d seen before I world-jumped, greeted me through the multiple triangular panels of the clear ceiling. Zero Point had been built on a dead world orbiting a middle-aged yellow star, very close to the heart of this particular galaxy. There were so many stars that even when it was supposed to be night, the clear domes were almost fully illuminated. A soft rumble of voices filled the dome, and I looked around to see that three other teams had gathered here, all apparently preparing for their explorers to go world-jumping.\n\tKass, my team lead, came up and planted a dry kiss on my face. Like me, she was a mammalian oxygen-breather, with two legs, two arms, and one head. Unlike me, she was clearly from a more feline people. Her dark green fur looked nearly black to my eyes, her narrow tail was about as long as her torso, and her pointed ears swiveled almost constantly as she listened to the world around her. She teased me frequently about being one of the very few \u201chairless primates\u201d ever found by the Coalition.\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right on time, Jayce,\u201d she purred, her tail swishing slightly. \u201cThe Coalition found four worlds suitable for us oxygen breathers.\u201d I watched as her slitted pupils widened a bit before narrowing again.\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a lot! Were they expecting to find that many?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, their psychics were investigating a region of the multiverse they hadn\u2019t looked at before. They only found a total of seven stable worlds.\u201d\n\tMy eyes widened; I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cSorry, that was surprise, not hunting preparation. Though I supposed they\u2019re similar?\u201d\n\tShe laughed, having picked up the habit from others she\u2019d worked with. \u201cClose enough, Jayce. We\u2019ve got your gear ready. You\u2019ll be going in with a breathing apparatus and a barrier field to start. We don\u2019t want you going all funny like that one time.\u201d\n\tI sighed dramatically. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll ever be remembered for anything else I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\tKass poked me gently in the ribs with a finger, her claw sheathed. \u201cYou helped improve the Exploration Team\u2019s protocols. And that pollen is a popular substance in a number of other worlds we trade with. So what if you were afflicted with an extreme case of synesthesia? You lived, did you not?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, Kass, it didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019d just like to be known for discovering a vacation world, you know?\u201d\n\tShe blinked, first her translucent set of inner eyelids, then her outer ones. \u201cVacation? What is this? My magic translates it as \u2018time not spent hunting, learning, exploring, or surviving.\u2019\u201d\n\tSome concepts just don\u2019t translate well across species. \u201cMy people would take extended breaks from these activities. The idea was that certain things caused stress, and that the break allowed for our bodies to recover from that stress.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou are a very strange person,\u201d she commented as she handed me my gear. The breathing apparatus felt heavy in my hands, straps pulling at my shoulders once it was on, even after she adjusted them. The earpiece she handed me nestled comfortably into my ear, a gentle pressure that soon eased as my mind adjusted to it. The mask put a bit of pressure around my nose and chin, anchored in place by straps that sat snugly across my throat and temples. And even though the mask and goggles were designed for my face, they still felt odd, applying pressure that I wasn\u2019t used to.\n\tThe rest of my team stood in a cluster next to the transit space, preparing their own equipment. Their chatter translated mostly as technical discussion: how sturdy the equipment was, how they\u2019d receive the information I\u2019d be collecting, and the like. Other teams were doing much the same with their explorers, adding to the thrum of sound echoing throughout the dome. The sound of almost thirty sentients, talking comfortably in their own language but translated easily into mine, was more comforting than anything else. Normally, there\u2019d only be one, maybe two teams in here at one time.\n\tFinally, the others gestured me over, offering comforting hugs even as I adjusted the belt carrying the barrier field equipment. It sat on my hips with a comforting weight, a tactile reminder that I wouldn\u2019t immediately be exposed to something unsafe in the atmosphere.\n\tKass gently nudged me into the transit circle. \u201cInitial exploration shows you\u2019ll be drawn to a location near an ocean. That\u2019s where the barrier is thinnest. And we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll be alone when you arrive.\u201d She planted another kiss on my cheek, and brushed her whiskers across my face in a gesture of affection. \u201cBe safe, Jayce.\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I answered. My skin began to tingle as the transit devices powered up. While I could use my magic to world-jump, technology made the process far easier. If I had hair on my arms, it would have been standing by the time Kass gave me the all-clear. Instead, I felt the prickle on my scalp as the hair on my head tried to stand up.\n\tWorld-jumping is quick, especially with help from devices that are meant to connect worlds and thin the barriers between them. In my world, rings of nested standing stones created thin places. At Zero Point, they used poles made of conductive material, arranged in geometric patterns very similar to the arrangements of those standing stones. \n\tI experienced a brief sensation, like pushing through a narrow wall of particularly thick water, and then I was conscious of the crash of waves, a beach of fine grain sand, and the tingling bite of cool, damp air across my exposed skin.\n\tAbove me were three small moons, two gleaming white crescents and the third orange and full and low over the ocean, casting an odd pale orange light across the surrounding landscape. From what I could see of the rest of the night sky, the stars here were far more scattered, more spread out across a sky that was a deeper bluish velvet than I\u2019d seen in quite a while.\n\tI slowly turned in place, my feet sinking a bit into the sand, and realized I was on an island surrounded by ocean. There were a few tall and thin trees anchoring bits of vegetation in the midst of an otherwise deserted island. I closed my eyes for several seconds, listening to the crash and rumble as waves rolled in, tumbling over each other, the hiss of foam forming and bursting as the ocean water moved up the sand beach and back out, and the deeper roar of distant waves that collapsed before they would swamp this island.\n\tKneeling down, I used some of my magic to illuminate the sand more clearly, and saw fine-grained white sand with very tiny bits of shell mixed in. The shells mostly seemed to be a pale cream color, but there were occasional flashes of rainbow from something iridescent. My magic told me the sand was safe to touch, so I picked up a small handful to run across my fingers. The fine grit rubbed my skin in a vaguely pleasant way, just soft enough to shift easily under my fingers.\n\tMy earpiece beeped, signaling that the subtle diagnostic tools embedded in my gear had finished analyzing the air. After a moment, one word sounded quietly in my ear. \u201cSafe.\u201d\n\tWith a bit of trepidation, I carefully pulled off my goggles, waited a minute, then loosened the straps holding my mask in place. I took a careful breath, and smelled salty air, damp greenery, and a faint hint of sweetness that seemed to come from the trees behind me. After a few slow and careful breaths, I felt myself relax; the cool night air, carried by a gentle wind over crashing waves, was a relief after months of breathing the dry and scentless air of Zero Point. The air here even felt a bit more heavy than Zero Point\u2019s air, though that felt like it was due to the humidity around me.\n\tI murmured to myself, \u201cThis, Kass? This is a vacation world.\u201d \n\tMy words faded into the sound of the waves and foam, this hiss and rumble of water washing onto the beach in front of me, as I set about measuring the island and taking readings for my eventual return to my team."}

I feel anticipation build as I walk into the washroom and turn on the faucet for the bathtub. I hear the roar of the water coming out, splashing loudly upon the porcelain. Soon the splashes dim as the tub fills. The sound of the rushing water mixing with the music from my phone is lulling.

Then I throw in the bath bomb and watch as the purple ball bubbles and rolls in the water. Small lavender blossoms emerge from the fizzing ball and float around in the tiny bath waves.\n        The tub is almost full so I turn the faucet off. Steam is rising from the tub, giving the room a gentle haze. I imagine this is what a loch in Scotland looks like in the morning. I take my hand and move it in the steam causing white wisps to swirl in random patterns. I take a moment to breathe in the scent of the lavender candles that compliment the watery fragrance from the tub. I place a glass of dark red wine on the corner of the tub and turn the lights off so only the soft glow of the candles remain.\n        Finally, my bath is ready. I sink into the warm blossom-filled tub. For the first few moments, I just enjoy the tension leaving my muscles. I pick up my glass of wine and, as I take a sip, I enjoy the warm feeling of the wine moving down the back of my throat. The taste is soft and full with lingering notes of cherry and chocolate. I set the glass down and just enjoy being in the water. My body feels so much lighter now. The lavender blossoms gently brush my knee.\n        I reach out to the little white stand next to the tub and get a fluffy silver hand towel. I fold it a couple of times and place it behind my neck. The soft texture beckons me to snuggle into it. As I move, the water makes a gentle sloshing sound and soft bursts of lavender mist lull me into deeper relaxation.

His father, John, the Great Chef under Queen Elizabeth I, had officially begun his apprenticeship in the royal kitchens at Hampton Court at the ripe old age of twelve. \n        The year was 1580, and a group of Spanish ambassadors were visiting the Queen\u2019s court in England. James had no idea why exactly this event held such importance, but he knew, according to his father, that it could hold the key to years of future peace. James\u2019 father also believed that the belly was the pathway to good relations for all and was eager for James to witness the joys of food diplomacy firsthand. \n        Since John had served as the Great Chef under Elizabeth and her father, Henry, he had a special place of honor in the royal household. He was always present at the opening ceremonies for the banquets, and this year he had secured his eldest son James a place as his newest apprentice, seated next to him. \n\tUnfortunately, James had been delayed while cleaning up back home. He had spent the last twelve exhausting hours manning the spit. A thankless but important duty in the kitchen, the spit boy spent hours on end slowly rotating the rod holding the suckling pig over the kitchen fire as it roasted. James smelled like a combination of bacon and soot, but his mother had managed to scrub all the black off of his face, at least. \n        James could hear the Anglican minister finishing off his far too lengthy prayers as he rounded the hall corner. The two armed guardsmen gave him a wink as he squeezed through the gap in the heavy double doors. He saw his father at the far end of the high table. This \u201cU\"-shaped table had the Queen at its center, her most important guests on either side, and lesser guests further out. \n        James made his way quietly towards his father. As the Queen was already seated, and technically he should be too, he kept his eyes down low and his hands clutched in supplication as he walked. He did sneak a glance at her majesty. He never truly believed she was entirely human. \n        She was dressed in shimmery blue fabric with vast puffed sleeves in an elaborate brocade pattern. Her red hair was secured beneath a gold tiara lined with green emerald gemstones. Her blue eyes peered out of a pale, white-painted face that gave her an otherworldly appearance. He averted his eyes back to the ground and continued his long walk to the far end of the room.\n        \u201cYou're late, boy,\u201d his father said, giving him a loving rub on the head after he sat down. \u201cYour mother cleaned you up well, though. And you haven\u2019t missed the best part. The feast is about to begin.\u201d\n        James looked up at the spread that was before him now that he was seated, and his eyes bulged from his head. He allowed himself to absorb the sights and the smells that accosted him all at once in dreamlike splendor.\n        The carvers brought out the meat plates first, and James beamed with pride. He saw his suckling pig at the far end of the table, a vivid red apple set firmly in its mouth. The pig was surrounded by Seville oranges and English roses, placed together to remind the guests of their special purpose today beyond their meal. \n        A continuous line of meats was then paraded through on silver platters. A turkey, imported from the Americas and raised in the back gardens of St. James Palace, had been roasted and then decorated with a plumage of peacock feathers. A leg of mutton, a favorite of James\u2019 father, had been stewing for days in a vat of Portuguese sherry and came out in a beautifully painted tureen. Then came an odd assortment of delicacies. Some of these, such as the gelatinous whale\u2019s tongue, James recognized but had no intention of trying.\n        As the plates began to fill the table in front of the many guests, the smell of the exotic spices of the rapidly expanding English empire filled the air. Nutmeg and cloves from the Far East wafted from the dishes. As servers lifted the lids from platters of roasted root vegetables, the aroma of pepper and cumin spilled forth into the room like smoke from a flame.\n        While James and his father were allowed to sit and eat at the vast dining table with the dozens of honored guests and the Queen along with her court, they waited patiently for her majesty to finish her meal before starting their own. They anxiously observed her enjoyment, feeling a great sense of shared pride with every bite she took and each course that emerged from the kitchen to take the place of the one before it.\n        The second and third courses emerged. Quiches of French brie brought a smile to the face of the Spanish ambassador, who apparently loved the cheese. The Queen clapped her hands in delight when the fish pie was rolled in on a small cart. The salmon had been caught the day before in a stream in southern Scotland, and the fisherman had rode all night to bring her majesty her favorite catch in time for the feast. The fish had been stuffed with leeks and baked in a pie before being topped with a creamy white wine sauce.\n        The final course was a thing of wondrous beauty: the desserts. James had dreamed about this course. In recent years, the Tudor dynasty had begun importing this magical material called sugar from their Caribbean colonies. This resource was more precious than gold, and James was fortunate enough to have a father with access to it, though very sparingly, through his position as the Great Chef. \n        Sugared wafer cookies, thin as lace and rolled into tubes, were placed on the table, scented with rosewater. Dried figs and dates brought back from trading missions to the Middle East surrounded massive sweet pies filled with delicious custards and topped with pomegranate seeds. And then, the finale: the master confectioner emerged with a fantastical marchpane sculpture. Sugar and almonds, ground into a sculptable paste and carefully stained, had been delicately crafted to resemble the Royal Barge. Tudor roses dyed with exotic saffron and lion\u2019s heads carved with snarling faces into the masthead brought out a gasp from the Queen. The room erupted in applause, and the master confectioner blushed. This feast would certainly go down as one of the best of this decade.\n        The Queen had finished her meal and was sipping her fortified wine as she began chatting casually with the Spanish ambassador in hushed tones. Some royal court members began to chat among themselves, and the lesser court members could now begin their own meal at the far end of the table. John fixed James a plate filled with an assortment of incredible concoctions, giving him a taste of foods fit for a Queen. James stared down at the beautiful plate and finally took his first bite. He thought to himself, \"If heaven were a place on earth, it must surely be England.\"\n"}

He meets a hummingbird named Peaseblossom, a spider named Cobweb, and a moth named Mustardseed. The story ends with Bottom dreaming. Make the story between 700 and 800 words long. ","targets":"        The overpowering ambrosial scent of the Titania's fairy bower was too powerful for Bottom the Weaver\u2019s mortal senses. As soon as Titania's attendants had escorted him into the bower, his body had been overwhelmed. He had stumbled into a sudden, deep, and delirious sleep.\n        When he awoke, he briefly opened his eyes. The kaleidoscopic, disorienting, and brilliant array of colors was too much to process. He shut his eyes tight and took a deep breath. He nearly choked on the lavish scent. It was thick in his mouth, floral and earthy.        He began to breathe shallowly and then more steadily. Slowly, he was able to distinguish some familiar scents in the air. Mint. Rose. Jasmine. Honey blossom. Sage. But all in such abundance and density.\n        His eyes still closed, he moved his hands over his face. Somewhere, deep in the recesses of his mind, he knew that he should be terrified when he felt an unfamiliar downy softness all over his cheeks rather than the bristle of his overgrown beard. Yet, the softness of his own face somehow eased him. He moved his hands up further and felt where his ears should be. Instead of curved cartilage, he felt a coat over his long, floppy ears that hung down below his chin. \n        Long ears? Far too long! Surely this face could not be his own! Yet, as soon as the thought struck him, it simultaneously left him. Of course, this face and these ears were his. They had always been his, just as he had always been in this bower. What other reality could there be?\n        He felt his ears perk up as he registered a low-pitched sound. Buzz-whistle-chirp. Buzz-whistle-chirp. What could it be? \n        Slowly, very slowly, he began to open his eyes. This time, his mind was able to register the blur of colors. He was lying on a bed of Mullein, and he focused on the gentle green hues and allowed them to soothe his senses. \n        Next, he was able to focus his eyes and distinguish the source of the unusual noise. What he saw was a most remarkable creature. Fluttering around his face, holding an oversized blossom in its beak, was a hummingbird. The bird was a blur of stunning iridescent turquoise. Buzz-whistle-chirp.\n        The remarkable bird was now at his ear. Buzz-whistle-chirp. Hail, mortal. The words had clearly come from the bird, though Bottom could not be sure if they were the sound of the wings or the bird\u2019s voice. Before he could process that question, his ears perked again. \n        Click-clickity-click. He heard the sound growing closer. \n        There, hanging by a shining thread that looked as if it was composed of moonlight, was a gorgeous eight legged creature. The deep blue of the spider\u2019s body struck a note somewhere in Bottom\u2019s mind. Royal Blue. It was the color of Pyramus\u2019 costume. There was a memory of holding cloth in his hands. Of weaving with dexterity and skill; labor and currency; comrades and responsibility; language and power. But such thoughts were not fully reachable now. They were obscured behind the deep ambrosial scent of the bower.         They belonged to the world of waking, not to this world of enchantments.\n        Click-clickity-click. \n        \u201cHail, beloved of our Fairy Queen.\u201d The spider pronounced the words in a lower and more crisp tone than the hummingbird\u2019s.\n        Then, another sound, louder this time. A slight rush of air hit Bottom\u2019s face as he heard a Whoosh-shug-whoosh-shug of flapping wings. An enormous moth, at least twice as large as the hummingbird, landed on the tip of Bottom\u2019s fuzzy nose. It was the most startlingly beautiful of the creatures. Its wings were a mosaic of dozens of shades of yellow. The most poignant hue was the deep, musky, earthy color of freshly ground grain.        Whoosh-shug-whoosh-shug. Hail, adored one. The voice came out with an inhuman \u201cthump\u201d, buttery smooth and full of vigor.\n        \u201cI cry your worships\u2019 mercy, heartily. I beseech your worships\u2019 names,\u201d Bottom said, hearing his own new voice for the first time. It rang out in a jarring bray.\n        \u201cPeaseblossom,\u201d chirped the Hummingbird. \n        \u201cCobweb,\u201d clicked the spider. \n        \u201cMustardseed,\u201d thumped the moth.\n        \u201cDrink,\u201d chirped Peasblossom. \n        The bird was suddenly at his mouth, tipping nectar from the flower petals into his open lips. Bottom drank the nectar. He felt it drip down his throat, honeyed and thick. \n        \u201cRest,\u201d clicked Cobweb. \n        \u201cSleep,\u201d thumped Mustardseed.\n        Restful, joyful drowsiness blurred Bottom\u2019s vision. His eyes closed. His senses dimmed. Surrounded by the delights and pleasures of the fairy bower, Bottom drifted back into deep, delirious dreams."}

The air was thick and oppressive, stifling any and all attempts to breathe naturally. It was akin to trying to breathe through a thick soup, but without the nourishing aspects such a meal would provide. All I received for my attempts at inhalation was a thick coating of moisture saturated air on my throat. It wasn\u2019t so intense that I couldn\u2019t breathe. It was immensely discomforting.\n        I stumbled through the obscuring mists, trying desperately to find a way out. But the haze rendered everything around me into an indistinct fuzz. This visual white noise paralyzed me. Taking even a single step forward felt as though my foot would simply pass through the floor into nothingness, causing me to fall into unending steam. The density of the mist stung my eyes, and I continuously had to wipe at them in an attempt to relieve the irritation.\n        That movement caused the sweat from my limb to join with the sweat on my brow. This fresh torrent found its way into my mouth. The salty tang of the sweat added an unwanted flavor to my struggle, which was already traumatizing enough without making salt an issue in the future. \n        I stumbled, forced to step forward lest my indecision compound the cost on my body. The only way to escape more permanent damage was by pushing through the struggle and finding a way out of this hellish place. But the shades of this realm wouldn\u2019t let me go quietly. Their unclear forms called out to me in whispered tones, as though their voices traveled across an immense vastness to reach me.\n        \u201cLeave\u2026\u201d \n        \u201cFlee from here\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThis place is naught but despair\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cSo I said to him, \u2018it might be a luxury to put one in, but can we really afford it?\u2019 and HE says\u2026\u201d\n        But their words do little to assuage my agonizing advance. The world starts to fuzz and fade at the edges as my tenuous steps seem to take me nowhere at all. On top of it, the smell of the place begins to seep into me. The cloying scent of cedar, along with the rank stench of alcohol, pervaded the space, but they began to fade as I neared a turning point.\n        Something was shifting. The scents were fading, the voices dulled, the prickling head subsided, my sweat ceased, and the haze was clearing. I could see, at last, a metal door set into a wooden wall. I hobbled towards it, my legs refusing to move quickly as the heat sapped my strength. The relaxed limbs rendered me a mobile slurry of moving parts, desperately trying to work in coordination with each other, until finally, at last, I reached the door. Grasping the handle, I wrenched it open.\n        The spirits of the place hissed in unison, calling for the door to be sealed once again, but I paid them no heed. I surged forward into the light and out of the mist.\n        The locker room was open, and many men were wandering around it in various states of dress. My friend looked up from his phone as I stumbled into the room. \n        \u201cSo, how was it?

Decorated doors lined the hallways in bright, colorful cutouts of dinosaurs, jungle animals, and storybook characters, welcoming students to their first day of school. Teachers stood outside their classrooms, waving and chatting with students and parents. The buzz of people caused a roar of unintelligible chatter. Jenny scooted closer to her mom and gripped her hand tighter. She felt her mom\u2019s smooth hand give her a comforting squeeze in return. \n\tThey finally came to a stop in front of a classroom. The door was covered in blue butcher paper. Fifteen cutouts of dark green frogs sitting on light green lily pads dotted the door. Each frog had a name hand-written in a bright primary color. Jenny found her frog near the middle of the door. Her name was written in yellow. She frowned a little because her favorite color was purple. \n\t\u201cOne, one, six,\u201d Jenny whispered as she read the black numbers posted by the door. The name listed under the number just looked like a jumble of letters to her. Though, she did recognize some of the words in green, taped to the door, and sounded them out. \u201cI. Am. Hhh-hhhh-hhop-hoppyyy.  T-t-to. Seeee. You.\u201d She giggled at the silly pun.\n\t\u201cWow! You\u2019re a good reader!\u201d A dark-haired lady wearing a light blue sleeveless dress smiled at Jenny. She had a soft, gentle voice and smelled like her grandpa\u2019s flower garden and coffee.The woman bent down and held up her hand for a high five. Jenny put so much force into it, she jumped off the ground a couple of inches. \n\tSlap! She looked up at her mom and proudly grinned, showing her crooked, little baby teeth.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Miss Hudson. Which frog is yours?\u201d the nice lady asked. Jenny leapt up and tapped the frog with her name in yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Jenny. Are you ready to have fun today?\u201d she asked.\n\tJenny nodded enthusiastically, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d\n\t\u201cAlright! Why don\u2019t you have a seat on a colored dot at the front of the room,\u201d Miss Hudson said. \n\tJenny started to skip into the room when she felt a tug on her arm pull her back.\n\t\u201cDid you forget something?\u201d Jenny\u2019s mom asked, kneeling down and holding out her arms. \n\tJenny crashed into her mom and wrapped her arms tight around her neck. She felt a lump in her throat, and she swallowed hard to clear away the fear. \n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be back at noon to pick you up and hear about your amazing day! I love you, Bean,\u201d her mom said.\n\t\u201cI love you too, Mommy,\u201d Jenny replied with the slightest tremble in her voice. She resumed her search to find a spot to sit. As brave as she was, her brown eyes still glistened as she turned around to give her mom one last wave.\n\tOnce she was inside the classroom, it seemed so vast. On her left were white cubbies with brightly colored baskets. \tEach had a crisp white card with a name printed on it in black. She was disappointed to see her name on a red basket instead of a purple one. \n\tA row of easels lined the right side of the room. In the middle of the room were three round tables, each with a basket of new crayons in the middle. She took a big whiff of the familiar, waxy smell. Maybe she would be able to draw a picture of her orange, fluffy cat, Theo.\n\tAlong the back blue wall was a vibrant mural of a huge rainbow with purple, orange, pink, and green butterflies from floor to ceiling. Four blue bean bag chairs, bigger than Jenny, circled a bookshelf. A kaleidoscope of books lined the shelves, and she guessed there must be a million books. Two egg-shaped swinging chairs with orange cushions hung in the corner. Jenny paused, deciding whether she had time to pursue the library and take a quick joyride in the swing. \n\tTwo boys ran past Jenny, their tennis shoes thundering on the thin orange carpet. She decided she should save that adventure for later. The dots were filling up, and she wanted to make sure she got a purple one. She hurried her pace, as only two purple dots remained. \n\tJenny had a big choice to make. One purple dot did not have anyone on either side. Next to the other purple dot sat a dimple-faced girl with short brown hair. Red, silk ribbons, which matched the flowers embroidered on her denim overalls, tied off the two short ponytails standing up on the top of her head. Jenny\u2019s stomach fluttered at the thought of talking to a new person. It would be comfortable to sit quietly alone. Nonetheless, this was a day of new adventures. \n\tJenny traipsed to her chosen spot and made eye contact with the girl in the overalls. She blushed and looked down, giving a reluctant smile. The girl grinned widely, revealing her dimples and her missing top front tooth. She excitedly waved Jenny over, and Jenny stood up a little straighter and strode across the room.\n\t\u201cHi, I\u2019m Kimberly!\u201d said the girl in overalls.\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Jenny,\u201d she said, settling on her purple dot. \u201cI like your ribbons.\u201d\n\t\u201cThanks!

She couldn\u2019t wait to tell her mom about her brave adventure and her new friend.\n"}

The roof had begun to peel, but it held its look mainly because any time I got a ding or a dent I got it repaired. \n        The snowpack had turned out to be thicker than I expected. I looked at the clock on my car, and it said 4:30. The rest of California would have another thirty minutes of daylight, but here, between the rising peaks of the Sierra Nevada, it was already getting dark. \n        I had started out from Sacramento just after lunch, but the roads were treacherous. My fifteen-year-old blazer had begun to emit a smell of rotten eggs halfway up the Forty-Niner highway. My catalytic converter was going. I gagged, flipped the heater off, and rolled down the window. Remnants of Mountain Misery, a low spreading bush, with pungent, sticky leaves covers these hillsides. The odor wafted in, along with pine and cedar.\n        I put the car into reverse and let out a small prayer as I threw my right arm over the passenger seat and peered over my shoulder. \n        \"Please, God, don\u2019t let me get stuck.\u201d\n        The blazer tried to reverse. Its wheels spun, and I gave it more gas. Too much, as it turned out. The truck lurched backwards, and I heard a sickening crunch from the rear. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and found myself sitting at more than a slight angle. The rear passenger wheel had slid off the edge of the road and lifted the driver's front wheel perhaps fifteen degrees. Now I only had two tires touching solid ground, if I were lucky. \n        I shifted into drive and pressed on the accelerator. The tires spun madly. The car vibrated as it furiously tried to dislodge itself. \n        \u201cCome on, old girl!\u201d I nearly shouted. \n        But to no avail. At last, I gave it up and turned the truck off. I patted the dashboard lovingly. \u201cYou did just fine,\u201d I said softly. \n        I climbed out of the blazer and zipped up my coat. I could almost feel it getting colder the further the sun sank behind Sugarloaf. \n        Making my way around the vehicle, my left leg unexpectedly sank in the snow up to my thigh. I grunted with the exertion and the bitter cold that surrounded my lower extremity. I gripped the front bumper and lifted myself up and back on solid gravel.\n        The cold began to sting, and I worked to wipe the snow away to keep my leg from being soaked. As I did so, I found my gloves and pants smeared with a sticky substance. I took a whiff and nearly retched. My jeans, and now my gloves, were covered in the sap of Mountain Misery and smelled like sage and rotten eggs. \n        I glared at the side of the mountain. The stuff grew in tentacled patches. It held hillsides in place from erosion all over the Sierras, and deer grazed on it when everything else had gone dormant. But there was a reason they called it Bear Clover.\n        With hiking boots, a heavy coat, warm, sticky gloves, and a cell phone on my person, I began the half mile trek the rest of the way to the cabin. No one else would come this way, so the truck would be good for the night. I needed to get inside.\n        Ten minutes of trudging through knee-deep snow in places, and the sunlight had almost disappeared. I pulled out my flashlight and flicked it on. It fluttered, and then died. \n        \u201cOh no!\u201d I groaned. \n        My left leg began to tingle with bitter cold. A patch of snow on my thigh had soaked through and started to freeze. I rubbed at the spot. I made a fist and loosened it up, rubbing to keep it warm.\n        Another few minutes passed, and I reached the spot on the road where I would normally have parked and took the footpath. Less than a hundred yards to go.\n        The tree growth was making visibility much more difficult. I had to keep moving, but I also tried to watch my step. If I twisted an ankle or something they might find a popsicle come spring. This wasn\u2019t a wide, flat road but a broken trail. \n        Another few minutes, and the light disappeared almost entirely. I stopped and breathed deeply, calming myself. The smell of the forest surrounded me. My primordial instincts listened for growls or snapping branches that might indicate danger. There were bobcats and foxes, and of course black bears. Hearing nothing, I reached into my jacket pocket and brought out my lighter. I would need it to build a fire to warm the cabin, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything else that would provide illumination. \n        The lighter clicked, and the flame lit up the ground ten feet in front of me. Amid the odor of butane, I walked five paces, stopped, and lit the lighter again. Five more paces. I hit the lighter again and nearly fell over backward as a huge pine loomed inches from my face, a hundred feet tall and twice my width. Somehow, I had wandered off the foot trail and nearly strolled into a ten-thousand pound tree.\n        At last, I reached the doorway to my cabin. I checked my lighter. It still burned bright. I would be able to get a fire going. Most of my upper left thigh had gone numb, and I hoped I hadn\u2019t lost my core temperature. I ran my hand along the reassuring cedar of the outer wall, smelled the spruce of the heavy front door, opened it, and went inside."}

As the sun goes down at the end of the day, Ruby and Mae leave the beach together, their laughter echoing throughout.","targets":"     Ruby and Mae sat on their yellow beach loungers, the white, attached awning shielding them from the sultry sun that was warming their legs. Their bare feet and toes were burrowed in the exfoliating, golden sands. Their once-young-looking legs and arms were now wrinkled and embellished with dark age spots, but they didn\u2019t care. Aging for them was a pleasure\u2014not something to be escaped. Their large, woven black hats rivaled their bright, tropical bathing suits, fully adorned with a teal and pink hibiscus and palm tree pattern. Ruby\u2019s once-dark-now-white hair was thinning and felt more coarse than it used to when she ran her creased fingers through it, but she kept it long like she always had. Mae\u2019s even lighter-white hair was short and curled on the top of her head, buried underneath her hat. Deep eye bags and crow's feet were hidden underneath their large, tortoiseshell-patterned sunglasses.\n     With their eyes closed, they listened to the white noise of the ocean crashing, sometimes slowly and softly and other times loudly and powerfully. When Mae and Ruby would open their eyes, they watched the waves roll on and off the beach, leaving rounded patterns in the sand. It was a beautiful sight for Mae and Ruby, who had been best friends since junior high and promised each other they would live in a beach house together after retirement. \n     Every once in a while, the two women would shift their heads forward and stare out at the clear, turquoise-colored water, taking deep breaths in, the bitter, salty air tickling their noses and throats. They ordered red and yellow margaritas from the beach\u2019s tiki bar, dancing to the music and carrying the glasses back to their loungers. The sweet and sour flavors of strawberry and lime mixed with tequila sent shivers through their bodies, making them feel like young women in their twenties. When they weren\u2019t reading novels or basking in the sun, they watched the children on the beach build golden sand castles. Mae and Ruby listened to the shrieks and screams from children who were either too scared or too excited to be in the ocean, reminding them of when their own kids were young. They watched youthful couples walk hand in hand, leaving footprints in the water-soaked part of the sand, stopping every once in a while for a kiss or a hug, their long bodies turning to shadowy silhouettes.\n     Ruby and Mae were both divorced, but to them, it really didn\u2019t matter because they always had each other. They were together through broken hearts, painful medical diagnoses, graduations, job losses, job gains, and everything in between. They relished the lives they had lived in their aging bodies, proud of not only their accomplishments but also their failures. As Mae and Ruby looked back, reminiscing and reminding one another of days past, lost summers, and cozy winters, their raspy, raucous laughter came through their lungs and out into the open air. There were years upon years of, \u201cDo you remember the time\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat about when\u2026?\u201d \n     Every once in a while, the less mature groups of generations would give the women questionable, uncertain looks, scrunching up their faces until they looked just as aged as Mae and Ruby. They smiled at these youthful citizens, knowing full well that one day, they, too, would become old, wrinkled, and hopefully, just as happy as them. \n     The sun began to fall behind the ocean and make its way to the other side of the earth, casting shades of pink, blue, and purple\u2014its golden rays no longer beaming through the palm trees. Mae and Ruby packed up their yellow loungers, grabbed their monogrammed purple, floral beach bags, and made their way across the cool sands with their unbreakable bodies, kicking it high in the air with their toes, their laughter echoing up and down the beach."}

Peals of jovial church bells, clanging in an unorganized symphony, mingled in the frigid air around us. Samir moved from my left side over to my right, his leather boots crunching over the frozen grass with each step. \n        His gaze was fixed on the skyline, slowly scanning up towards the cotton candy sky. The vibrant pinks and blues of the horizon emitted a gentle glow. He turned to me with an encouraging, contagious smile. \n        \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked. With a face that mirrored his, I closed my eyes and raised my arms into the air in a grand stretch. I spread my fingers into a star, immersing my hands, wrists, and face in the icy air of Christmas day. Amidst the sea of loudly chiming church bells from all across the city, I heard hushed German spoken between the couple passing behind us on the trail. Lowering my arms, I quickly stuffed my hands into my warm coat pockets, grasping onto the hot hand-warming pouches in each. They emanated heat like tiny furnaces, quickly melting the frosty feeling from my fingers. \n        \u201cI feel great.\u201d I answered, huffing a laugh at the final word that exited my mouth in a pale cloud. Drawing in an icy breath, I smelled the distant, smoky scent of a hot grill, followed by a mouthwatering waft of meat. Chicken? I sniffed again, stopping myself from following the smell. Was that garlic and onion, too?\n        \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d Samir inquired, glancing toward the descending trail. People in winter hats and heavy coats of black, green, and orange were slowly advancing up the hill in a large group. The sound of their carefree laughter blended into the clear chimes of the church bells.  \n        I laughed to myself, feeling pure contentment. The delicate burn from a cold breeze prickled my cheeks as I smiled. \u201cI was just noticing how good it smelled! Should we go?\u201d\n        He turned back around to face the reddening horizon, adjusting his crimson beanie. \u201cYeah, just one more second. This is all so cool.\u201d\n        Samir turned around to grab my hand, and we eagerly interlaced fingers. I was always surprised at how soft his skin was and how warm his hands stayed, even in the piercing chill of winter. I noticed him close his eyes, smiling gently to himself.\n        Stepping closer, our heavily layered shoulders rubbed against each other as I clasped his hand tightly in mine. Following his lead, I closed my eyes and focused on the surrounding sounds: the gravelly taps of footsteps on the adjacent path, the booming tones of a dozen bronze bells from all different directions, the chatter of excited conversation, and the gentle breeze that softened the buzz of bustling activity from the city center. A group of carol singers began humming notes in harmony as they passed by, and I looked up to see them just before they began their descent down the trail. \n        I watched two purple, wooly hats dip out of sight at the trail\u2019s switchback. \n        \u201cShould we follow them?\u201d I asked, and Samir nodded.

Their shared bed was empty, and apparently had been for long enough for the covers to have gone cold on Bailey\u2019s side of the bed. A slow sense of concern permeated the fogginess in her head as she blearily grabbed for her phone, missing it twice before she was able to turn it over and check the time.\n        \u201cOh no,\u201d she muttered, \u201cit\u2019s 3:08 in the morning.\u201d Seeing the time set off a memory of a discussion they\u2019d had a few hours ago, when Melinda was trying to urge Bailey into bed. Melinda had expressed concern about not risking another night not being able to sleep, and Bailey admitted concern as well. She\u2019d been hoping her partner might be able to fall asleep tonight, but apparently their insomnia was still going strong.\n        \u201cHeck,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cat least neither of us has work? Maybe the warm milk will work this time.\u201d She slowly put on a sleep shirt and shorts, shoved her feet gracelessly into the well-worn, fluffy, shark slippers Bailey had given her as a gag gift a few years ago, and made her way out into the living space of their apartment.\n        They\u2019re probably at their laptop. At least we have enough space this time for more than just a monitor and a gaming console, Melinda thought sleepily. Sure enough, Bailey was dressed in their favorite soft pajamas, sitting at their shared computer desk that stood against the wall next to their couch, staring with an intent expression at the screen that lit up most of the living area.\n        \u201cSweetie?\u201d Melinda called softly. It was after three in the morning, and they did live in an apartment complex. The management had once again sent out an email asking people to keep the noise down, and Melinda didn\u2019t want any kind of trouble.\n        Bailey frowned, clearly not at their partner, and waved a hand at the laptop\u2019s screen. \u201cSorry lover,\u201d they responded, \u201cthe insomnia just wasn\u2019t going away.\u201d\n        \u201cThis is the second night you haven\u2019t been able to get to sleep,\u201d Melinda murmured as she walked across the room. She reached out and asked, \u201cIs a hug okay?\u201d\n        \u201cYeah.\u201d\n        Once she\u2019d hugged her partner, Melinda looked over at the mug on Bailey\u2019s left, emblazoned with the genderqueer flag, and clearly holding some fluid that probably had been hot but was now cold.\n        \u201cPlease tell me that was herbal?\u201d\n        \u201cIs, technically. One of the chamomile blends Heather recommended.\u201d A brief guilty look crossed Bailey\u2019s face as they took a sip and grimaced. \u201cAnd of course it\u2019s gone cold.\u201d\n        \u201cLet me heat it up. We have a microwave for a reason beyond quick popcorn and heating up leftovers.\u201d At Bailey\u2019s nod, Melinda picked up the mug and carried it to the kitchen. After the microwave beeped, Melinda took the now warm mug back out to her partner, and carefully set it back on the coaster.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know if talking about it would help, and I\u2019m not sure whether warm milk would either,\u201d Melinda started slowly.\n        Bailey turned to their partner and smiled. \u201cI love you, you know that, right? You wake up after three in the morning, and your first thought is to take care of me.\u201d\n        Melinda blushed. \u201cI love you too. You know that, and I know your insomnia isn\u2019t frequent, but it does have an impact on you. Two nights awake isn\u2019t good for you, and I\u2019m worried about it going longer.\u201d\n        Frowning now, Bailey replied, \u201cThis is only the second night, and I\u2019m not feeling all that bad.\u201d\n        Melinda responded quietly, \u201cDid your mood just drop?\u201d\n        Bailey stared at their partner for a moment, then nodded sheepishly. \u201cSorry. I know you care.\u201d They took a long sip of their tea, and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like it any more than you do, and I\u2019m not sure what kicked it off this time.\u201d\n\tMelinda nodded. She began with what felt like a mantra, a recitation of their good fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ve both got stable jobs, we haven\u2019t had to worry about rent, groceries, or bills for almost a whole year now, and even though I\u2019m bisexual, and you\u2019re genderqueer, our new neighbors haven\u2019t shown any signs of bigotry.\u201d \n\tBailey nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re safer, we\u2019re more secure, and I\u2019ve been kind of thinking about adopting a cat.\u201d\n        \u201cSo it\u2019s not the anxiety this time?\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s just it. Rationally, consciously, everything seems fine. But my brain just didn\u2019t calm down long enough tonight for me to actually fall asleep.\u201d\n        Melinda glanced at the open laptop. \u201cSo instead, you\u2019re finding people on the Internet who\u2019re wrong?\u201d \n        \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, there are always people on the Internet who\u2019re wrong,\u201d Bailey said with a smirk. \u201cBut no, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. Did you hear about the stunt a few days ago, back around the winter solstice?\u201d\n        Yawning, Melinda answered, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific, sweetie. Lots of weird stuff happens around this time of year. I hear the G\u00e4vle Goat is still standing, which is kind of weird.\u201d\n        \u201cNot weird, a stunt. Here, let me show you.\u201d Bailey turned their laptop, so Melinda could see the screen, and pressed play on the video player that took up most of the screen. While Melinda sat down in the seat next to Bailey, she noticed Bailey bouncing up and down a bit.\n        At first, Melinda wasn\u2019t sure what she was seeing. There were murmurs in the background, but the image was almost completely dark. Even after her eyes adjusted, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear what was going on. The audio was mostly the sound of people muttering and coats squeaking and rustling.\n        Bailey paused the video, and Melinda blinked a few times. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re showing me?\u201d\n        \u201cNewgrange, in Ireland. More specifically, the passage tomb, the one where the chamber is illuminated by the rising winter solstice sun.\u201d Bailey exhaled slowly. They\u2019d been fascinated by Irish stories and legends for years, but neither they nor Melinda had ever been able to afford a trip overseas to visit.\n        Bailey stood up and started pacing, their mug of tea clearly forgotten again. \u201cThe Irish Office of Public Works started allowing visitors to take videos a few years ago, and honestly, most of them are like this. The part inside the passage tomb is always dark, then you get a brief amount of time when the rising sun illuminates the chamber, then fades out.\u201d\n        Fascinated despite the hour, Melinda asked sleepily, \u201cSo what makes this one so different that people are calling it a stunt?\u201d\n        Bailey gently nibbled on their lower lip. \u201cJust watch.\u201d After a few moments of fumbling with the mouse, they pressed play again.\n        At first, there was nothing to see, and very little to hear. Slowly, the video got brighter, illuminating stone walls, hinting at the carvings on the walls of the room, and revealing people clad in heavy coats, standing around and whispering to each other. The camera pointed down at the ground, as a narrow strip of sunlight began growing on the floor, showing dirt and gravel, then back up as someone in the video whispered excitedly, \u201cNow you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d \n        When Bailey paused the video again, Melinda nudged her partner and pointed at the mug of tea. \u201cYou should drink this before it goes cold again.\u201d\n        \u201cYou see how tiny this chamber is? Barely enough room for all the visitors and the guide, they\u2019re packed in like sardines.\u201d Bailey stared at the mug for a moment, then took an experimental sip that turned into several mouthfuls.\n        \u201cOkay,\u201d Melinda said slowly once her partner had put the mug down, \u201cI take it that\u2019s important?\u201d\n        Bailey made a frustrated noise, paused, and exhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve watched this about five times. I forgot this is the first time you\u2019ve seen it.\u201d They then started the video again.\n        As the two of them watched, in the video the beam of sunlight brightened the passage tomb and touched the back wall of the rear chamber, eliciting a gasp from one of the people there. Someone else spoke quickly in a language Melinda didn\u2019t recognize, and as the beam continued to brighten, several people emerged from the wall of the rear chamber. \n        Melinda stared at the video as Bailey paused it there. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 what?\u201d She felt like her brain was swimming through pudding, particularly thick pudding, and she blinked several times before she looked at her partner.\n        \u201cI know,\u201d Bailey said quietly. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any hidden chambers behind the back wall. They\u2019ve used radar and image scanning technology on the entire mound, and there\u2019s just nothing but more rock and dirt behind the wall. The chamber is so small you couldn\u2019t hide anyone inside, and it\u2019s not like people wouldn\u2019t notice if you installed a false wall. But look at the people, I mean, really look at them.\u201d\n        Melinda nodded, and squinted a bit at the screen. The first thing she noticed was that they were all wearing heavy furs over green clothes. The second thing was the heavy gold jewelry each of them seemed to be wearing, all adorned with the triple spiral that was also present on the stones inside the passage tomb. The third thing was the fact that all the people who\u2019d appeared to come through the wall had pointed ears.\n        \u201cLet me guess,\u201d Melinda mused, \u201cpeople arguing these are just really skilled cosplayers?\u201d\n        Bailey snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s about the nicest theory I\u2019ve seen so far. Most of the nasty comments are just people ranting about how the Irish will try anything to boost tourism. Which doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n        \u201cBecause they\u2019re not relying on tourists,\u201d Melinda answered. \u201cPlus, Newgrange and all the other sites aren\u2019t going to want more people, because even with all the protections, the sites still get damaged.\u201d\n        \u201cExactly. So either this is some incredibly elaborate stunt that some movie company has managed to pull off, or those are actual elves.\u201d Bailey stood up and started pacing around the room again.\n        \u201cSweetie?\u201d Melinda asked carefully, conscious of her partner\u2019s mood. \u201cIs this what\u2019s causing the insomnia?\u201d\n        \u201cNo! Yes! Maybe?\u201d Bailey paused and turned around to face their partner, blinking blearily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about this until tonight. But I guess it\u2019s not helping?\u201d They shook their head. \u201cYou went to bed, I\u2019d made the tea and was trying to calm down when Bridget messaged me.\u201d\n        Melinda groaned. \u201cI love that girl, but she\u2019s got the worst timing ever.\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows I have episodes of insomnia?\u201d\n        \u201cSweetie, we told her last time. I know I did, anyway, because she accidentally did this last time, too. And we asked her to wait until morning to text you anything interesting.\u201d\n        Bailey blinked slowly. \u201cOh. Right. I remember that now. But I guess she was excited and didn\u2019t think?\u201d They frowned. \u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t expecting a link to that video, and when I watched it the first time I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I fell down an Internet rabbit hole reading up on what happened, then suddenly you were saying something to me.\u201d\n        Slowly, both because she was tired, but also because she was worried, Melinda said, \u201cMy love, I\u2019m concerned for you. You\u2019re losing track of time now, and I know you\u2019re irritated and having some trouble thinking. This isn\u2019t going away any time soon, I don\u2019t think, and if we can\u2019t get a handle on the insomnia, you\u2019re going to be even more upset when there aren\u2019t any updates no matter how often you watch.\u201d\n        Bailey spun on their partner, then paused. \u201cLove, I\u2019m sorry. I was just about to snap at you, but you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t want to be stuck awake and making both of us miserable. It\u2019d be nice if my brain would let go of whatever this is,\u201d they finished, gesturing at the laptop screen and the paused video.\n        \u201cBack rub. That worked really well last time.\u201d Melinda rubbed her eyes tiredly. \u201cI think I\u2019d be more excited if I were more awake. We\u2019ll do some more research about this whole thing, including the elves, when we both wake up, but please close the laptop and come back to bed?\u201d\n        Nodding, Bailey pushed the lid of the laptop down with exaggerated care. \u201cI love you. You know that, right?\u201d Suddenly, they yawned, and the two started laughing.\n        Melinda stood up, kissed her partner on the forehead, and gently tugged them back to the bedroom. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see about that back rub. Hopefully that will shut your brain up enough for you to fall asleep.\u201d\n        \u201cI hope so too,\u201d Bailey answered quietly."}

Because the thoughts in my head are creeping. My mind racing instead of sleeping. And the words keep repeating in my brain, all the same. That\u2019s the sound of, \u201cOh. My. God. If I fall asleep at this very moment, I can get three hours of sleep.\u201d\n        How likely is that to happen? I mean not likely since I\u2019m thinking about it at this very moment. Nice. I have less than three hours to sleep now, and the amount of time will keep shrinking  as I continue to talk to myself. Of course, all my brain will do presently is think up alternative lyrics to Simon and Garfunkel songs. \n        Tomorrow is going to be a beautiful day as I struggle to stay awake, only to have slumber once again elude me at night. I\u2019m going to be so grumpy. Grumpy is the nice spin I put on my mood. Trust me, it\u2019s very dark and foul without sleep. I\u2019ll have to do my best to avoid people. It\u2019s better not to inflict myself on the world any more than necessary after a sleepless night. \n        Meanwhile, my dog Buttercup is softly snoring next to me, her little silver head is resting on my pillows. Insomnia is not her issue. She is under the blanket with just one front paw curled over the covers. In about an hour, she will need to get up to go outside. Ugh. The amount of sleep I may get keeps decreasing at a seemingly exponential rate.\n        This brings me to my next sleep-time-reducing thought: I have to decide, should I just stay up until Buttercup needs to go out or risk just barely falling asleep only to be awakened by \u201cthe paw?\u201d The second choice seems worse because when I wake up just as I\u2019m falling asleep I get an awful dizzy nauseous feeling.\n        Spoiler alert, I start to fall asleep and get \u201cthe paw.\u201d Buttercup stands up in bed and hits my shoulder with her paw until I respond.  As the Borg say, \u201cresistance is futile.\u201d As predicted, I feel positively awful at the moment. I\u2019m at the door, waiting for Buttercup to come back inside. She is taking forever. I flick the outside lights on and off in a desperate attempt to get her inside while I\u2019m feeling a little sleepy. There may be hope for some sleep yet, if the dog ever comes back inside.\n        I end up opening the door and pleading with Buttercup to come back inside. My pleas go unanswered. So, I tell her if she doesn\u2019t come in, I\u2019m going back to bed and will just leave her out there. \n        It\u2019s during these moments that I\u2019m not the best dog mommy. Now I feel like the worst person ever, and I have to apologize to Buttercup. I tell her that I would never leave her outside. To make it up to her, I give her some peanut butter on her bone. That\u2019s another ten minutes stricken from my remaining sleep time. As an added bonus, I feel awful that I got upset with my dog. It\u2019s not her fault that I can\u2019t sleep. \n        After Buttercup finishes her peanut butter, we return to the bedroom.  One would think we could simply slip back into bed and try to sleep. However, getting settled is a project. I don\u2019t even want to think of how much time I\u2019m losing during this process, so I just try to suspend my belief for a bit.\n        To settle in, Buttercup must first decide which side of the bed she wants to sleep on. Once that is determined, I have to hold the covers up so she can go underneath and walk in small, tight little circles until she plops. Often she plops and realizes that things did not turn out the way she expected, so we have to repeat the process. \n        After plopping, she needs to decide if she will have her head covered or not covered. Sometimes she just pokes her nose out. If she sticks her whole head out, I cross my fingers in hopes that she is content to steal my pillow. If it turns out she is not happy for some reason, we have to start at the beginning. I hear the ticktock of the time I have left to sleep playing in my mind like a metronome. \n        At this point, I probably have an hour left to sleep. This leaves me with the eternal dilemma: do I stay awake or try to sleep for a bit? Do I check the time, or is ignorance bliss? \n         I ponder these questions, and check the time in spite of myself. I have about forty-five minutes left to sleep. Ugh! Less time than I thought. Why did I look? \n        Perhaps the thirty-minute power nap can be my thing today. After all, that gives me fifteen minutes to fall asleep and thirty minutes to nap. I can do this!\n        No, I can\u2019t. I might as well log into the game I play on my phone because sleep is not happening for me tonight. I pick up my phone and the glow from the screen is blinding. I\u2019ve the worst headache now.  Well, at least my castle wasn\u2019t burned to the ground whileI was busy not sleeping. \n        My alarm goes off on my phone. Blah. I get up to start the day, and leave the room alone because Buttercup is happily snoring under the covers. Lucky dog, I envy her sometimes. \n        As for me, it\u2019s time for coffee."}

","targets":"        Mary Godfrey heaved the large cured leg of salted ham onto the meat hook in the display window. Her back hurt, and she felt like she had not slept for weeks. Her mother had said she should work harder during the day and that then the good Lord would bless her with sleep. But Mary didn\u2019t think she could work any harder than she was. Her husband, Peter Godfrey, was the only butcher in Salem, Massachusetts. He ran a very successful business, and Mary had to work right alongside him every day of the week.\n        It was early February in 1692. A light snow had begun to fall in the streets of Salem, scattering across the cobblestone streets in a salt and pepper pattern. Townspeople with stern faces in the black and white garb characteristic of their religious restrictions scurried down the sidewalks. A group of men dressed in military garb and bundled up in frontier coats rode brown, muscular horses down the center of town, talking in boisterous voices. Mary watched all of them through the window, wondering how many would brave the snow over the next few days to come into the shop. \n        Mary also saw Jane Hamilton and her daughter Sara, dressed in all their finery, stepping out of the carriage line that brought passengers to and from Boston. Jane smiled at Mary and gave her a wave from across the street. Mary did not wave back, but returned to her work maneuvering the hams into the display window. She never liked Jane, seeing her as a soft-headed woman full of vanity.\n        Mary had recently turned fifty, and her three sons had all moved away with their own families to Boston where they worked as merchants. Mary missed them terribly but was glad to see them leave Salem. The town did not offer much in the way of careers for young men outside of farming, and the boys had no interest in taking over the butcher shop. She had no daughters, but was quite happy about this fact. Mary had a bit of a reputation in town for her attitude towards women, particularly young girls.\n        Mary stood at around five feet and eleven inches tall. She was the tallest woman in town. She was broad-shouldered, with a head full of wavy red hair and freckles to match. Mary had always been big, even as a child. She had also been somewhat of a tomboy, more interested in working with her hands than playing with dolls. Mary got along well with the boys of Salem, but she didn\u2019t care much for the girls of the town.\n        In her teens, she received the nickname \u201cMean Mary\u201d from her female peers. She would frequently pick out the prettiest girl of the group and harass her verbally, and sometimes physically, when given the opportunity. Mary didn\u2019t know why she enjoyed this practice, she just knew that she did. Since her father was a respected town elder, Mary never faced much in the way of punishment for this behavior, but it only served to further isolate her from the girls in Salem.\n        But Mary didn\u2019t care. She met the love of her life, the butcher\u2019s son, Peter Godfrey, and married him at the age of 18. She was blessed with handsome sons, a happy marriage, and in her older age, she enjoyed working as an assistant to her husband in the shop. At least she had enjoyed it until recently.\n        Mary had gone through \"the change,\" as it was called, over the past year, as all women eventually do. It had been hard on her, as it gave her a great deal of fatigue. She had tried all sorts of home remedies and had even purchased a variety of tonics from the local wise woman in town. While Mary was always reluctant to trust a woman, this particular woman had provided herbal remedies to the townspeople of Salem for decades in addition to acting as the local midwife. Her trust was rewarded at first when the tonics seemed to give her more energy during the workdays.         But then, last month, her sleep dramatically worsened. She had headaches constantly, and when she went to rest, she could not slumber. At night, she tossed and turned with hot sweats, often lying in bed next to Peter until the sun began to peek through the curtains of the window.\n        With the butcher shop on the first floor of their two-story home, Mary frequently used her insomnia as a reason to begin work for the day early. Other times, she would pray for sleep and stay in bed in the hopes that God would give her some reprieve. Even though Mary knew she was not sleeping much, she also knew she was sleeping at least a little. But the sleep she did get was very abnormal. Sometimes, she would awaken in strange places doing strange things. Sometimes these things frightened her.\n        The first time this sleep awakening happened was a week after her troubles began. She thought she was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when suddenly she was awake. She was standing just before dawn in her neighbor, John Wesley's, pumpkin patch. Mary was holding her husband\u2019s knife in her hand, which he used to gut hogs when they were brought in for slaughter. She had gutted what looked like three dozen pumpkins, scattering their seedy innards across the field as she worked. Mary gasped at what she had done. This damage would cost Peter an outrageous amount if John Wesley saw her. She ran home just as the sun was rising.\n        She told Peter what had happened. He was not angry, but fearful.\n        \u201cMary, did anyone tell you to do this?\u201d Peter asked.\n        \u201cNo, Peter. I told you. I thought I was awake. But then I wasn\u2019t, and I woke up with the knife in my hand in John Wesley\u2019s field,\u201d Mary replied, annoyed at having to explain this yet again.\n        \u201cI only ask because you know there have been many strange happenings around Salem lately. Some whispers of witchcraft and the like. You would tell me if some black being or devil man had visited you? Would you not? I will protect you, no matter what you may have agreed to.\u201d\n        \u201cPeter, you are being as ridiculous as the witchcraft nonsense floating around town. You know as well as I do that all of that foolishness is the idle minds of idiot girls with little better to do than make up stories.\u201d Mary said this with anger in her voice. She did not like her husband jumping to such conclusions. \n        One week later, the sleep awakening happened again. This time, Peter found her, and it was worse than ever. Mary awoke to him shaking her hard by the shoulders. She was shivering, and when she looked down, she was completely naked. \n        It was sometime before dawn, and she was sitting on the hard dirt of the riverbank, located fifty feet from the back door of their home. In her hand, she held the end of a cow\u2019s intestine. Behind her, the intestine trailed all the way up the path and back to the house. She suddenly had the taste of copper in her mouth, and looking down at the water\u2019s edge, she saw her reflection. Blood covered her mouth and hands. She screamed.\n        Peter was now convinced that Mary had been cursed by a witch. He wanted to take their troubles to the Reverend Samuel Parris. His daughter and niece had seen several of these evil beings and had been directly impacted by their \"devilcraft.\" But Mary would hear nothing of it. She told Peter that this new affliction had to be related to the womanly changes she was going through and that once it was all over, she would return to normal. She would continue drinking her tonics from the wise woman and working in the shop. No one needed to know anything else.\n        But the sleep awakenings came to a head on the night of March 24th, 1692. Mary had doubled up on her order from the wise woman and drank two full bottles of the black, viscous potion that morning. She had worked all day at Peter\u2019s side in the shop, feeling younger than ever. She went to bed that evening next to her husband, hoping that she had finally turned a corner in her condition.\n        She awoke with a start. It was still dark outside, but the morning light was beginning to creep across the horizon. Mary could see this horizon as plain as day because she was downstairs, standing in front of the counter of her family\u2019s shop. She blinked several times as her vision seemed fuzzy, and she felt almost drunk. Then she heard a muffled moaning. She looked down and screamed.\n        A man was on the ground in front of the shop door, wrapped tightly in the sheepskin strips they used at the shop to package up large cuts of meat. There were patches of his flesh peeking out from the sheepskin wrapper, revealing a thick coating of lard, which they used to help prevent the meat from spoiling. A meat mallet with hair and blood was on the ground next to the counter, and a small patch of blood stained the sheepskin covering the top of the man\u2019s head. The only part of his face that was not covered in sheepskin were his eyes. She immediately recognized him as Peter.\n        \u201cOh, Peter! I am sorry!\u201d She started tearing away the strips from his face, only to look up and see a gathering of her usual early morning customers in front of the open shop door.\n        Jane Hamilton stood at the front of the line with her daughter Sarah and her husband Albert. \u201cWitch!\u201d she shouted.\n        The Godfrey\u2019s neighbor, John Wesley, was also standing at the front door, waiting to buy his weekly order of ham hocks. \u201cWas it you who destroyed my pumpkins three weeks ago? If you were bewitched enough to do this to your husband, what else could you have done?\u201d\n        Within minutes, the local doctor showed up and began to give medical care to Peter. \n        He appeared confused and disoriented from the blow to his head. Two of the town constables and the jailer then came in as well, followed by Reverend Samuel Parris. He formally charged Mary, still in shock and sitting on the floor next to Peter, with the crime of witchcraft, and the constables took her away towards the town jail.\n        Most of the townspeople dispersed. Albert Hamilton helped the doctor carry Peter back upstairs to his bed. Peter had tried to speak, but the doctor told him to rest for now. Jane Hamilton and her teenage daughter Sarah smiled at one another as they walked out of the shop hand in hand.\n        \u201cI hope you are not feeling a lick of guilt, Mother. After all, Mean Mary has had that coming to her for years,\u201d Sarah said.\n        Jane replied, \u201cNot at all, my dear. Mary was such a bully to me and all my friends. Even Old Ann, the wise woman, recalled her penchant for teasing any girl who crossed her path back in our childhood.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd for the tonics to work so quickly was quite a surprise! I am so glad that we bumped into Old Ann last month, and that she was willing to help us in our endeavor. I guess she was also tired of Mean Mary. That nectar of nightshade packed a punch, that is for sure,\u201d Sarah said. \n        \u201cYes, and cost us a pretty penny. Albert will be displeased at my excessive spending this month, but he will get over that in time. A happy wife equals a happy life.\u201d Jane let out a laugh matched by her daughter\u2019s. It had taken her thirty-five years, but for Jane, revenge truly was a dish best served cold.\n"}

Have him interact with a reflection of himself. Keep the word count to around 900 words. ","targets":"        It is truly amazing that simple reflection can completely transform the meaning of a thing. Moonlight is simply sunlight reflected off the surface of the moon. Yet, I\u2019ve stood in the moonlight for hours and felt no warmth from it. I did not feel the rejuvenating warmth that comes from the great light in the sky. I only felt the cold that comes from the night.\n        It certainly didn\u2019t help that I was in the middle of a forest. If you\u2019ve never stepped into the woods at night, I envy your ignorance. People who live in the cities, or even the suburbs, don\u2019t understand the absolute darkness that the night brings. Even if you\u2019re in a dark room, there is generally some kind of light coming in from somewhere. Electronics, lights from your neighbors house, even the streetlights outside. All of it serves as a little hint that there\u2019s civilization still out there. You are not alone.\n        You are also not alone in the forest. \n        The difference being that you are surrounded by your fellow man in the cities. While that might be a hell of its own design, there is a special kind of fear when one hears the scuttling of something distinctly not human in the bushes. When you know that there\u2019s something near you, something that could very well be hungry and want you to fix that, something that you don\u2019t know the exact size or location of, you feel a wholly unique kind of fear.\n        Thankfully, it is something I was used to. Over the last month, I had been wandering the woods at night, looking for something. I had only received vague flashes of it in my sparse almost-dreams. A path through the trees that lead to\u2026 something. Something I had to find. The dreams always came quickly, and they always stole away what little chance for sleep I might\u2019ve had. So, I filled the time with wandering the woods. Woods that looked distinctly similar to the ones in my dream. My exhausted body would drag itself out of bed, and despite my immense desire for sleep, I would wander. I\u2019ve seen my fair share of weird stuff during my travels, but I never found what I was looking  for.\n        At least, I hadn\u2019t until that night. \n        I stood before the sight from my dream. A hallway of trees led deeper into the woods, and at the end of them, a faint light glowed. It was silvery, like mist but even more ethereal. I took a step towards the path. \n        Something darted from the underbrush. It didn\u2019t look like a normal animal. I rubbed my eyes. Lack of sleep that comes from insomnia can make you see things. I\u2019ve seen plenty, but I\u2019m familiar with how the dark can twist the shape of animals in the woods. This thing was different. It was wrong, like something just mimicking the shape of a small animal. \n        I was terrified, but I couldn\u2019t leave. Not when I finally found myself in front of the vision from my dream. I stepped onto the path, fully expecting to be jumped by some abomination. But aside from some rustling, nothing bothered me. \n        The glow at the end of the path slowly enveloped me. It was bright, pushing back the dark of night. I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what was glowing until I reached a clearing at the end of the path. It was a lake, perfectly smooth. Reflected in its waters was the moon. The pale light shone down into the water and was radiated back even stronger. It was amazing, and didn\u2019t seem quite real. \n        I peeked over the edge of the lake. In its reflection, I saw myself perfectly mirrored. Too perfect. Not a single ripple disturbed the lake. Even as the wind sifted through the trees, the lake remained absolutely still. The stillness felt like the tranquility just before passing into sleep. A tranquility I hadn't felt in some time. I reached towards the water. When I touched the surface, I could feel the wetness, but also the warmth of another hand.\n        My reflection\u2019s hand suddenly shot out of the water and wrapped around my wrist. I tried to pull back, but it was too late. My reflection tugged and pulled me into the water. \n        With a splash, I fell in. There was nothing beneath the water. Just emptiness and the other me. The man smiled.\n        \u201cYour world has been connected. Already the other side leaks through. I\u2019m the only one that can help, but I can\u2019t be there while you are. So, you\u2019re going to have to take a vacation in my world for a time. Stay safe, and don\u2019t look at the moon,\u201d he says.\n        He lets me go and starts to swim through the nothing towards the surface. My world is up there. I look down. In the depths of the lake, another surface rests. But it is wrong. The world looks different, looks incorrect in a fundamental way that I can\u2019t describe. I sank towards the other world, but as I went I called out to my reflection.\n        \u201cHow? How did you call me here?\u201d I asked.\n        He looked down at me. \u201cWhat is a dream but a reflection of reality? Where you\u2019re going is where all reflections live, even dreams. Best of luck, other me.\u201d\n        With that, he broke the surface and I felt myself fall through the bottom of the lake.\n"}

They give me nightmares,\u201d Zoe moaned, wrapping a pillow around her face to cover her ears. \n        \u201cSorry. How about Ed Gein?\u201d Marco asked.\n        \u201cWas he the body snatcher guy?\u201d Zoe\u2019s voice was muffled by the pillow.\n        \u201cYeah,\u201d Marco said.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just turn it down a little.\u201d Zoe placed the pillow back behind her head. She lifted one side of her eye mask and looked at her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s 4:13. Why are you still watching murder shows?\u201d\n        \u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Marco said, fiddling with the remote. Zoe shook her head. \u201cWhat? The narrator\u2019s voice is soothing.\u201d \n\t\u201cDid you take your melatonin?\u201d\n\t\u201cYep. Four of them. And two hydroxyzines.\u201d He scrolled through the menu on the TV. \u201cOoh! \u2018The Real Leatherface.\u2019 I haven\u2019t seen that one. \n        \u201cYou\u2019re so weird.\u201d She pulled her eye mask back down and flipped on her stomach. Their black cat, Zeus, laid down on Zoe\u2019s back, and started making biscuits. She was lulled asleep within a couple of minutes. \n        Years of working unconventional hours as a chef had wreaked havoc on Marco\u2019s sleep cycle. Switching from day shifts to late-night shifts signaled to his body that he always needed to be awake. Zoe, on the other hand, had no issues with sleep. She was out cold within two minutes of her head hitting the pillow. Marco had timed her and frequently reminded her of this fact. If it took her fifteen minutes to fall asleep, she considered this to be a terrible bout of insomnia. She was beginning to think Marco resented her for this. \n        Zoe believed that if Marco was awake, he wanted the whole world awake with him. He was compelled to complete unusual and unimportant tasks in the dead of the night. She was dreaming about surfing with a magic sea turtle in Fiji when she awoke to her Pomeranian, Coco, growling. She hurried to the living room, where she found Marco gripping a struggling and kicking Coco in one arm. In his free hand, he held a pair of nail clippers. \n        Zoe rubbed her face with both hands. \u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d she asked, sleepy and annoyed. \n        Coco nipped at Marco\u2019s chin. \u201cI noticed she needed a little nail trim,\u201d he said, motioning with the clippers to the furious dog.\n        \u201cShe\u2019s going to the groomer on Thursday,\u201d Zoe said. \n        \u201cOh. Okay. Great.\u201d He released Coco from his grasp. Coco scampered to Zoe, and hid behind her legs. Zoe sighed, scooped up her dog, and headed back to the bedroom.\n        The next night, she was startled awake at 3:04 by a loud crash. The rumpled sheet next to her suggested Marco was most certainly involved. She flipped on the hall light. \n        \u201cMarco! Are you okay?\u201d she called out. There was no response. \n        She searched each room, trying to find the mystery crash. Her stomach fell, and a wave of dread washed over her when she saw the door to the basement opened a crack. Zoe had been in the basement one time. It was during the showing of the house before they bought it. The Serial Killer Basement, as she called it, was right out of a horror movie. It was a gray dungeon with a concrete floor and cinder block walls. The creaky wooden staircase was at an impossibly steep angle. A dim, single bulb light hung in the center of the basement. The musty smell was, no doubt, an indication of a deadly fungus that would give rise to the zombie apocalypse. Zoe shuddered at the thought of the terrible things that must have happened in that space. \n        \u201cMarco?\u201d she called. She took a deep breath and slowly pushed the door open. In a flash, the cat darted up the stairs and between her legs. Zoe lost her balance and shrieked as she stumbled backwards into the wall. This set off Coco, who yapped from the safety of the living room. \n        Marco raced up the stairs to investigate the commotion. He extended his hand to Zoe to help pull her up. She pushed his hand away and got up on her own. \n        \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Did I wake you up?\u201d he asked apologetically. She stared at him, and he rambled on to break the cold silence. \u201cI was reading an article about baseball cards. I couldn\u2019t think of the last time I saw my old cards. But anyway, I found them in a box. In the basement. That was the crash. So, yeah.\u201d\n        Marco\u2019s nighttime adventures continued to disturb Zoe and her sleep. She was awoken from a deep sleep by Coco licking her belly button. She pushed the persistent Pomeranian away. \u201cStop, Coco,\u201d she mumbled. \n        The sound of metal clanking, and then a faint swish swish swish, caught Zoe\u2019s attention. The noise stopped. As soon she closed her eyes again, clank clank swish swish swish. She slid on her slippers and shuffled down to the kitchen to see what Marco was up to now. \n        There he stood, in the kitchen, wearing his green robe and bear paw slippers. He held a butcher knife in one hand and a sharpening steel in the other. Pieces of his hair were standing up all over his head. He looked at Zoe wild-eyed from his third night in a row without sleep. \n        \u201cWhy?\u201d Zoe asked\n        \u201cI need to sharpen some knives. For work. At the restaurant. Where I work.\u201d \n        \u201cI swear to God, I am going to be so mad if you murder me in my sleep,\u201d she said sarcastically. She turned to go back to bed.\n        \u201cI\u2019m not a murderer,\u201d he said with a menacing laugh.\n        \u201cSounds like something a murderer would say.\u201d\n        The next night, at 10:00 p.m, Marco popped a couple of melatonin. He slipped into bed and pulled the fuzzy blue blanket up. \u201cI feel good about tonight. I\u2019m actually tired,\u201d he said, searching for a true-crime documentary to watch.\n        \u201cI hope so,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you've gone crazy.\u201d She gave Marco a kiss and was out as soon as her head hit the pillow. \n        Her eyes popped open. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she whispered. She reached for her phone, careful not to disturb Zeus, who was curled by her head. It was 2:30 a.m.\n\tShe looked over at Marco. He was laying on his back, mouth open, snoring loudly. She tried to settle back in, but she couldn\u2019t get comfortable. She repositioned her pillow. Zeus opened his eyes, annoyed, and then promptly went back to sleep. Zoe closed her eyes, and tried to clear her mind, but she was wide awake. Her legs moved in anxious frustration. She looked at the clock. 3:07 a.m. She turned over to her back and focused on her breathing. She adjusted her eye mask, as the flickering light from the television crept through a gap. \n        \u201cWe the Jury in the above-entitled action find the defendant, Orenthal James Simpson, not guilty of the crime of murder.\u201d Although the jury acquitted the football legend, many believe that O.J. Simpson got away with murder.\n        Zoe looked over at Marco again. He snuggled up in the blanket and smiled. Wide-eyed, she stared at the ceiling until morning. \n"}

She walks away from the counter without looking at him.\n        Once in the room, the man goes to the bathroom sink. He takes a bottle labeled \u201cSleeping Pills\u201d out. He takes two of them with water from his hand. \n        \u201cYou haven\u2019t slept for a week. You\u2019ve got to get some sleep,\u201d he says to himself in the mirror, pocketing the bottle. \u201cEven if it's a few minutes. You\u2019ll get to the clinic and get some help. They say you can\u2019t die from insomnia,\u201d he sighs, \u201cBut you can sure wish you were dead.\u201d\n        He lies back on the bed, taking none of his clothes off, and closes his eyes. The next moment, two men start arguing in the adjoining room. The arguing grows louder. There is the sound of furniture being thrown, and the man\u2019s eyes open. There is such a commotion that the wall shakes and his bedside lamp tips over. \n        The man goes into the hall and knocks on the door. More furniture is thrown, and more arguing ensues. He knocks louder. The man looks up and down the hall but doesn\u2019t see anyone else. It sounds like whoever is in the room is having a knockdown, drag out fight. \n        The man goes down the elevator to the main floor. As he approaches the front desk, the concierge hangs up the phone.\n        He stands there silently for several moments, but the concierge doesn\u2019t greet him. Finally, he leans forward. \u201cThere is fighting going on in the next room. It\u2019s so bad I can\u2019t even shut my eyes.\u201d\n        She doesn\u2019t look at him, and starts typing. An older man approaches and stands next to the concierge. His name tag says \u201cmanager.\u201d\n        The man looks at both of them, as the concierge types at the computer. Neither of them looked at him. He is perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m not doing well. I can\u2019t sleep because of the noise in the next room,\u201d the man says louder.\n        The concierge continues to type. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move him.\u201d\n        The man leans forward.  \u201cI just need to get some sleep,\u201d he says, slapping his key on the counter.\n        The concierge taps a few buttons and puts a new key card in front of him. \n        \u201cKeep an eye on him,\u201d the manager says, turning away.\n        \u201cThanks, but maybe you should check on the people in the next room,\u201d the man says sarcastically, as he watches the manager leave. \n        In the new room, the man walks to the bed and falls face-first onto it. He sighs, pulls a pillow under his head, and takes a deep breath. A moment later, a large dog begins barking in the next room. The man pulls the pillow over his head. The dog continues to bark. The man gets up, goes to the toilet, and relieves himself. \n        As he stands there, the dog keeps barking. He sighs, goes to the sink, opens the complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste, and starts brushing his teeth. Looking into the mirror, he listens to the dog howl. He closes his eyes, his toothbrush dangling in his mouth, and sighs.\n        The man exits the elevator to the first floor and goes to the front desk. He can\u2019t see anyone.

His eyes close, and his head tilts back. \u201cJust a couple of minutes,\u201d he says softly.\n        He sits there, eyes closed, breathing deeply, urging sleep to come. Dark smoke drifts over his head.         He sneezes, then coughs and opens his eyes.

The flames have engulfed most of the first floor. He passes by the front door when he stops. Three men in heavy jackets and ski masks are carrying two children out of the hotel. They throw them into a black van and peel away.\n        \u201cStop!\u201d he yells and runs after them. He goes through the front door and runs halfway down the street before the van pulls out and disappears. \n        He stands there frantically, looking around. The hotel casino is on a road with no other buildings in sight. No one else is in the parking lot. Then he sees headlights approaching from the opposite direction. \n        \"Oh, good, somebody,\u201d he mutters. He goes to the sidewalk, and as the headlights near, he can make out the vehicle is a bus. \n        A ride-share shelter stands ten feet away, and he moves towards it. As the coach approaches half a block away, he holds up his arms to get attention, but it isn\u2019t braking. He waves his arms desperately, but it still doesn\u2019t slow. The man leaps out of the way as the bus smashes through the shelter and keeps going. \n        The man gets to his feet and shakes his fists in the air. \n        He stands there, watching the bus lights disappear, and turns to see the hotel become engulfed in flames. Then it begins to snow. \n        \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d he screams into the night. \n\n        A young female nurse is looking at the man, lying in a hospital bed. She is checking a clipboard at the end of the cot. \n        An older male nurse steps into the room, and the man in the bed lets out a cry. \n        \u201cHe\u2019s not in a coma.

{"example_id":"example_112","inputs":"Write a story about someone with insomnia. The story should be between 1600-1700 words. Hailey is a sixteen-year-old girl suffering from insomnia. One night, she is having trouble sleeping, so she decides to draw in her room for a bit. When it\u2019s 3 a.m., she decides to go for a walk to the algae-filled pond in her neighborhood. She walks to the pond and then sits down in a dry area. After twenty minutes, a spacecraft picks up Hailey. The \u201ccreatures\u201d ask Hailey to help them stop Halley\u2019s Comet, which is supposed to crash into their planet. Hailey becomes friends with the creatures and creates the first Gravity Tractor that pushes the comet off-course. Orb, the creature who first commissioned Hailey for this project, puts her to sleep and returns her home. ","targets":"        Hailey lay in her bed, cocooning her body underneath her ruched-satin, purple blanket. She could feel her various stuffed animals\u2014green aliens, brown goats, black teddy bears, and small, spotted dogs\u2014 at the foot of her bed, all staring at her with their midnight-black eyes. She shifted to look at them, barely shadows in the darkness, and then pulled her blanket over her head. \n        Hailey closed her eyes, but her mind was still racing. Did I finish my homework? Darn, I have to stay after school tomorrow. Did I brush my teeth? I don\u2019t remember. Maybe I should brush them again, just in case. Hailey pulled the blankets away from her face, sitting up. She looked at the wall to her right\u2014posters of years past\u2014different fandoms, phases, and obsessions, all haunting her. Anime characters with tall, spiky hair looked as though they were going to jump out at her with huge fists and kicks; characters from fictional shows and worlds laughed at her. Her inability to sleep was not serving her well tonight. Her fading childhood was conspicuously obvious.\n        Hailey reached over to the cream-colored nightstand next to her bed and turned on her nightlight. The ambient glow radiated throughout her room, casting shadows onto her wall and old, carpeted floor, which she stared at for a second. The carpet had never been changed\u2014remnants of red spilled drinks, various paints, and sharpie marks were embedded into its threads. She sat back in her bed, picked up her digital art tablet, and began to draw. When Hailey couldn\u2019t sleep, creativity cascaded out of her mind and onto the screen, as though she were a machine who didn\u2019t actually need sleep. That was the only solace she had in knowing she was an insomniac\u2014that every night, during the deep quiet, she could get lost in creative thought.\n        After twenty minutes of swiftly scanning her stylus across the screen, Hailey looked at the clock. The ticking was about to drive her mad; it was either that or the fact that it was nearly 3 a.m., and she hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in a few days. She placed the tablet on her bed and moved her legs over so they were hanging off the side, her bare feet digging into the old, rough fibers of the carpet. \n        Hailey walked over to her closet and started to dig through her white laundry basket. She found some rough-looking blue jeans, a black turtleneck sweater, and blue and white striped socks. She tiptoed down the stairs, trying her best to avoid the creaky spots. Hailey slid on her black Converse shoes one by one, placed the purple headphones she\u2019d decorated with yellow star stickers over her ears, and stepped outside.\n        Hailey began to walk down the driveway, the music pulsating as she slowly bopped her head along to the beat, whispering the lyrics to herself. She stepped onto the street and didn\u2019t bother looking back at her home. She didn\u2019t want to be reminded of the fact that she should be resting. \n        Hailey just wanted to enjoy the still hours of the early springtime morning\u2014the peaceful lull of the incandescent stars and blanketed sky above her. She made her way across to the back corner of the neighborhood, where a pond full of algae and lily pads silently sat among robust green trees and soggy grass. Hailey found a small, dry area to sit. She cradled her knees to her chest and stared out at the water, which had no reflection. Hailey placed her head on her knees and swayed gently, the light wind sweeping through her hair.\n        Twenty minutes passed, and the wind started to intensify. Hailey looked up, fluttering her eyes as the breeze hit them. The trees rustled rapidly, and the once-still water was now decorated with ripples. Her hair danced around her head, and the gusts knocked her headphones into the dirt. The clouds parted rapidly, and hovering right above her was a large, round, silver object.\n        She squinted, fixing her gaze on the saucer. The bottom buzzed and opened, and a blue, fluorescent light radiated down onto Hailey. Her body became stiff and rigid, and her eyes started to water. Hailey drifted up, her mind becoming a haze of memories. She entered the metal disc, and was gently placed on her feet. \n\tStaring at her were two tall, gangly creatures. Their skin was shiny and chrome-like. Their eyes were oval and black, slick, and lucid. As Hailey\u2019s body loosened, she started to breathe heavily as her eyes darted rapidly from side to side. She opened her mouth to scream when one of the creatures stepped toward her, its feet shuffling on the ground as it made a click-click-clicking sound with its mouth.\n        Hailey squinted. \n        \u201cYyyyeeeessss\u2026?\u201d She spoke slowly, as though she were unsure of her own name.\n        \u201cYou are comet?\u201d\n        Hailey looked down.\n        \u201cComet? No?\u201d\n        The creature stepped back and started clicking with its counterparts.\n        Hailey thought for a moment, bewildered as to how these supposedly intelligent creatures could think a human was also a comet.\n        \u201cOh! You mean Halley\u2019s Comet?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, you are comet. Halley\u2019s Comet?\u201d \n        The creature walked over to a large, rounded window and pointed to the atmosphere. They were fully submerged in space now, surrounded by the luminous celestial expanse of space. The sun was beginning to rise on Hailey\u2019s side of the earth, its rays drowning out a blackened sky. Hailey walked over to the window and stared at her planet, a fascinating globe enhanced with swirls of blue, green, and white. She looked back at the creature. \n        \u201cI am Hailey, but I\u2019m not a comet. I\u2019m a human.\u201d\n        \u201cYou help stop Halley\u2019s Comet?\u201d\n        \u201cHelp stop it? How can I do that? Why would I do that? Halley\u2019s Comet is no threat.\u201d\n        The creature walked to the center of the craft and, with just his fingers, opened a hologram of a comet and a planet that looked to be Jupiter. They moved the comet in circles with their fingers, and then released it, showing it crashing into the planet. \n        \u201cHalley\u2019s Comet isn\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d Hailey said, confused. \n        \u201cOrbit is off,\u201d the creature explained, \u201conly Hailey can stop Halley\u2019s Comet.\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that,\u201d Hailey explained. \u201cI\u2019m only sixteen. I don\u2019t know much about space or comets.\u201d\n        \u201cYou don\u2019t sleep,\u201d the creature said.\n        \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d\n        \u201cWe watch.

In every science class, I was always taught that Halley\u2019s Comet couldn\u2019t hurt anything.\u201d\n        The creature blinked, curling its long, thread-like fingers into its palm. They walked over to an easel that held a large, white piece of graphing paper. Next to it sat a small table with charcoal pencils and clay-like, rubbery erasers. They pointed at the easel.\n        \u201cYou draw plan.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d Hailey was very confused now.\n        \u201cYou draw plan. You draw?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, I do draw, but I don\u2019t think I can draw you a plan on how to stop a comet. I draw characters and animations and alie\u2014I mean, uhm,\u201d Hailey trailed off. \n        She looked around, every creature in the flying saucer was now surrounding her, staring with sad eyes, searching for hope\u2014hope that was only wrapped up in her. She saw tall creatures holding small ones; she saw creatures that looked older, wrinkles starting to form around their eyes, their bodies not as slender as the rest. \n        \u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll help. But it\u2019s going to take time. How much longer do we have?\u201d \n        \u201cTwenty\u2026days. Here, days shorter. In Hailey\u2019s time, ten days.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not a lot of time at all. But I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n        Hailey took advantage of her inability to rest. She slept mildly and sparingly, just enough so that she didn\u2019t slowly go insane. The creatures taught her how to spot and track comets. She learned about the atmosphere and space. She talked with each being on the ship and learned about their lives and planet, how this species came to be, and what their goals were for the future. Hailey learned that they were not a threat, and instead, wanted to live, unharmed, in the tranquility of space.\n        As the threat drew nearer, Hailey created the plan for the first Gravity Tractor\u2014a device that can deflect other objects in space, pushing asteroids and comets off course. With the advanced 3D printing technology and metals found on the ship, it took very little time to create this giant machine. \n        On the day Halley\u2019s Comet was supposed to strike the creature\u2019s planet, jutting its round mass through the atmosphere, Hailey watched, surrounded by her friends. The saucer pushed the Gravity Tractor towards the comet, slowly and steadily. Gently, and without too much strength, so as not to destroy the infinite shooting star, the Gravity Tractor pushed it away, launching it further and further into the unoccupied expanse of the universe. \n        Hailey smiled, pleased with her work. After all, she could now consider herself both an artist and a scientist\u2014all great things to be when you suffer from insomnia. She went around and hugged every creature. When she came to Orb, the creature who had left their fate in her hands, she wrapped her arms around them gently. Suddenly, her eyes felt heavy, and she fell over in Orb\u2019s arms. \n        \u201cYou rest now,\u201d Orb said, as the saucer neared closer to Earth. A light beamed onto Hailey\u2019s home, right above her room. She floated to her bed, sleeping soundly, where she settled gently, her room feeling warm and serene.\n        Finally, she slept. \n"}
{"example_id":"example_113","inputs":"Write a story with a character that has insomnia. Make the character a senior dog named Shadow, who\u2019s paranoid that her owner Lidia is in constant danger after she\u2019s badly injured in a car accident. While the woman recovers, the dog\u2019s paranoia concerning outside threats and the outside world builds. She starts barking at any and all sounds, convinced they\u2019re threats, and barely sleeping. Eventually, Lidia and her sister notice the dog's exhaustion, and Lidia tries to comfort Shadow and encourage her to rest. The story should be 1,400 to 1,500 words. ","targets":"        After the accident, I could only nap when Lidia left the house. Exhaustion would usually take an hour or so to overwhelm me, but I wouldn\u2019t stay asleep. That\u2019s when I knew I had a problem. I was consumed by worry either way, but even when she wasn't there, I still couldn't relax my nerves.\n        As her dog, I had one responsibility: keep her safe. In the ten years since she adopted me, this had never been an issue before. Sadly, the outside world proved far more dangerous than I\u2019d been ready to accept. \n        It all began when she didn\u2019t come home for a week. The first night of her absence, I was relocated to Lidia\u2019s sister\u2019s house, where I slept on the cold floor of her bedroom. It was an uncomfortable week, but in retrospect, I\u2019d be thankful to get any sleep at all.\n        I just hoped Lidia would be okay. When I\u2019d finally see Lidia again, now wearing a cervical collar, back brace, and bandages, rest would become an afterthought.\n        When Carla brought me back home, my hopes were confirmed when I heard Lidia call, \"Come in!\" \n        I ran up to her bedside with so much incredible joy that my body could barely contain it. Lidia was back! She extended open arms to welcome me, but it was a slow and weak greeting. I could see the love in her eyes, but most of what I noticed was pain. Carla, Lidia\u2019s sister, offered to watch me while she recovered.\n        Lidia shook her head. She told Carla that I\u2019d help her heal.\n        I would, I thought. I promised myself then and there that keeping her healthy would be my sole focus. It was terrible to see her covered in a mess of straps, braces and bandages. In the weeks to come, I'd watch the purples and greens of large bruises blossom across her arms. Lying at her side, I listened sadly to her labored breathing.\n        How could she have gotten so terribly injured? She must have been attacked. I couldn\u2019t be certain what creature could do such damage to Lidia, but it was certain I couldn\u2019t let her leave again. \n        Thankfully, she didn\u2019t fight me on it for two full months. She remained in her bed, and I dutifully stayed by her side. I found myself sleeping less, fully attuned to every noise around us. Anything could be a threat.\n        Every couple of days, someone would stop by our apartment to drop off food and water. I sniffed strangers for ten full minutes before I let them enter without loudly objecting. Carla came by the most, and after her visits, she would take me on a walk. \n        This was another difficult adjustment. How could I guarantee Lidia\u2019s safety if I wasn\u2019t with her all the time? I tried to make walks as brief as possible, even to Carla\u2019s confusion. \n        \u201cShe's cooped up inside all day, yet she hates to leave the house,\u201d Carla joked when we quickly returned. It was a few weeks into Lidia\u2019s bed rest, and she\u2019d already appeared to be in far better spirits. She was still wearing her bandages but seemed more like her warm, happy self.\n        Lidia typed on her laptop as I climbed onto the bed. Her soft chuckle eased my nerves. \u201cShe\u2019s just like me,\u201d Lidia replied with a smile, and I curled up beside her in silent agreement.\n        After weeks of resting, Lidia began to heal. She would take lots of phone calls, always talking in an exhausted tone about the accident, car insurance, and catching up. Her breathing quieted and slowed back to normal at night.         Her mass of blotchy bruises began to lighten.\n        After three months had passed, Lidia took off her neck brace. She could finally return to the outside world. As pleased as I was for her progress and increased mobility, this news only exacerbated my tiredness.\n        I anticipated her return in the late afternoon. I could rest briefly in the mornings if I tried my hardest, lying beside the front door, but I couldn\u2019t keep from wondering if she was safe. Fear always woke me right back up. What if she was hurt again? What if she didn\u2019t return? \n        In my concern, my mind wandered to dangerous places. I didn\u2019t like her leaving and going back to a world that had wounded her so direly. I wanted to protect her at all times, though I knew she\u2019d never let me. Anytime I\u2019d walk with her into the hallway as she was leaving for the day, she\u2019d push me back inside and lock the door.\n        She\u2019d return home unwounded every time. While each return would briefly assuage my fears of the day, I was wide awake that evening. Lidia\u2019s state had definitely improved, but she still had somewhat of a limp and would wince in pain when lifting things. I wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t hurt herself, so I\u2019d follow her closely while she moved around the house. \n        I listened constantly for lurking threats; I\u2019d hear loud beeps from the street, crashing thumps from the upstairs apartment, or the barking of a big and angry dog late at night. I\u2019d fly into a rage, barking loudly to fend them off, but         Lidia didn\u2019t understand me. But, I\u2019d gladly take her frustration if it meant I\u2019d successfully scare off intruders.\n        \u201cShadow, calm down!\u201d she yelled at me on a particularly early morning before she left. I\u2019d heard an ominous rumbling in the building, louder than any normal apartment noise. Lidia quickly dismissed me until she opened the door to the hallway to leave, and I caught sight of the culprit: two men trying and failing to carry a sofa down the stairs.\n        As the door swung shut, I wondered whether those men were actually dangerous when I felt a wave of exhaustion bowl me over. I woke up on the rug nearly two hours later, thrust back into the world of anxiety I\u2019d come to inhabit. \n\tLidia would return, night would fall, and I\u2019d be back to pacing, lying by her side, and barking at threatening sounds. She was a heavy sleeper, so thankfully, I could walk around at night without waking her.\n\tStill, this was a dangerous cycle. It took an unignorable toll on my energy. I could intimidate, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to fend off anything in my weakened state. Almost six months after the accident, I'd only worsened while she healed. Still, I never considered giving up my promise.\n\tCarla noticed my exhaustion first.\n\t\u201cHow old is Shadow?\u201d she asked, stopping by our place after Lidia came home.\n        \u201cShe\u2019s a little over ten.\u201d\n\tI slowly chewed my breakfast of kibble and scrambled eggs while Carla moved towards me. \u201cShe looks like it. Aren\u2019t old dogs supposed to sleep a lot? She\u2019s always pacing.\"\n\tCarla hesitated before adding,  \u201cShe looks kind of exhausted, honestly.\u201d\n\tLidia stood up. \u201cI figure she gets good hours while I\u2019m gone, and she\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m sleeping. But she does look a little ragged.\u201d\n\tThey watched me while I ate, and I could nearly feel myself falling asleep in my bowl. Lidia walked over and gave me several big, comforting pets.\n\t\u201cIs ten very old for a retriever?\u201d she asked.\n\t\u201cYep. Senior status,\u201d Carla answered. \n\tThat evening I prepared for another night watch, though my weariness had grown painful. I crawled onto the bed after a rigorous effort, feeling an uncanny mix of focus and fatigue. I could hear rustling outside again. \n\tI started to bark, slowly approaching the window as Lidia entered the room in her pajamas. \u201cNothing\u2019s out there, Shadow,\u201d she assured me, walking towards the bed. She turned off the bedside lamp, tucked us underneath the sheets, and wrapped her arms securely around my torso.\n\t\u201cGo to sleep, okay?\u201d she said, squeezing me in her gentle hold. I tried to keep my head raised, still listening for intruders, but couldn\u2019t hear any. I prepared to bark again, but she gently petted my chest.\n\t\u201cEverything\u2019s okay,\u201d Lidia repeated, her breath slowing. Mine was slowing too. I lowered my head back onto the pillow, surprised at how comfortable I felt. The secure sensation of lying in Lidia\u2019s arms reminded me of years gone by, when the two of us were younger. She always made me feel protected wherever we went, no matter what happened.\n\tA grand wave of sleepiness, one I could never quite succumb to in the past few months, flowed over me. \n\tWithin minutes, I fell into a long-overdue, peaceful slumber. \n"}

Their bedroom window faced a courtyard that normally insulated them from the normal sounds of Vestillen, the capital city of the Pellenos Commonwealth. As the tumult slowly infiltrated their conscious mind, they heard the door to their bedroom open, followed by an insistent voice. \n\tWho is that? That\u2019s not the housekeeper; it\u2019s his day off. Wasn\u2019t expecting anyone.\n\tIt took them several more moments to recognize Faren, a messenger and a good friend.\n\t\u201cHigh Mage Kellis? High Mage Kellis! The Ruling Council requests your presence as soon as you are able.\u201d\n\tAs they forced their eyes open, they realized the sunlight that normally filtered through their heavy curtains was completely absent. The realization helped drive the sleep more quickly from their mind.\n\t\u201cFaren. A moment. I was dead asleep.\u201d\n\tFaren answered, \u201cI know, Kellis, and I\u2019m sorry to have woken you.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t, not exactly,\u201d they replied slowly. \u201cI began waking because of the sounds of the city.\u201d Kellis threw back the covers and pushed themself to their feet, shrugging on their dressing robe.\n\tMeanwhile, Faren cast simple spells to light the room. Glowing orbs bobbed to the ceiling in a color similar to the sun but with a softer light out of consideration for Kellis. \n\tAs they ducked into their closet, Kellis called out, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\tFaren moved a bit closer to the closet doors. \u201cThe bakers noticed it first, of course. They\u2019re up well before sunrise anyway, and a few of them apparently grew concerned when the sky didn\u2019t grow lighter. By then, others had woken and started their labors and still no early dawn light. By the time the clocks chimed the rising of the sun, it hadn\u2019t risen, which set the city off in a panic.\u201d\n\tWhen Kellis emerged, they\u2019d chosen a dress, a simple green kirtle with a pale cream blouse and barely any other ornamentation. They\u2019d pulled their reddish-brown hair into a very quick braid, and looked for all the world like just another average person, and not one of only three High Mages for the Commonwealth.\n\tThey frowned as they spun, then sighed. \u201cMy gender fluidity seems to be in flux at the moment. This outfit feels right, but that may change. I\u2019ll grab my emergency traveling bag, then we can get to the capitol building.\u201d\n\t\u201cAh, the Ruling Council is meeting in the Topaz Chambers today. For security reasons,\u201d Faren added quickly. She bounced in place a bit, clearly worried. \u201cNot to hurry you, High Mage, but how quickly will you be ready?\u201d\n\tEmerging from the closet again with a vivid blue leather valise, Kellis sighed. \u201cThis is what I needed.\u201d They frowned, picking up on the noise of panic and Faren\u2019s nerves. \u201cThe trouble is, everyone knows about the Topaz Chambers. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the distraught and desperate look for the Council there.\u201d They glanced around the room once more, shaking off the lingering traces of sleep, and asked, \u201cDo the portals still work?\u201d\n\t\u201cThey worked earlier, to get me here,\u201d Faren responded. \n\t\u201cThen we\u2019ll take my personal portal.\u201d Kellis moved through the open doors to their bedroom, walked a few feet down the simply furnished hall and turned left into their workroom. On the far side of a room filled with cluttered desks, over-packed bookcases, and mostly closed cabinetry, the portal frame rested against the far wall, mimicking a normal door frame. Though, most door frames were not constructed of a shimmering rainbow metal and inscribed around all edges with magical sigils of travel and transportation.\n\tKellis walked up to the frame, tapped it three times on the right side, then said, \u201cThe receiving room of the Topaz Chambers.\u201d The space inside the portal shimmered to life, and Faren stepped through, followed by Kellis.\n\tAlmost immediately, Kellis winced as the noise of twenty-nine Council members and their attendants broke upon them like a tidal wave. A faint sense of unease surfaced briefly in their mind before they quashed it.\n\tI can panic later, after this is resolved, they thought behind a facade of calm as they strode from the sparsely furnished receiving room through the partially open doors to the Council chamber. \n\tThe room was well lit by both magic and lantern light, allowing Kellis to take in, at a glance, the honey brown wood of the chamber and three-quarter circle table, the uncertain to fearful looks on the people inside, and finally the glass dome that showed only a very few of the brightest stars in an otherwise dark sky.\n\tSo it\u2019s only the sun that\u2019s missing, Kellis mused. Not the best sign, but not the worst either. They had another moment of unease. If Firethroat had erupted, all the light in the sky would be blotted out. But eclipses don\u2019t last this long, and the next one isn\u2019t for several months.\n\tOut loud, they called to the chamber, \u201cHigh Mage Kellis, reporting as requested. Are the other two High Mages here or on their way?\u201d\n\tSilence fell across the chamber instantly, and Kellis watched as expressions changed from fear to hope.\n\tThe head of the Council, Ambervaren, shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, High Mage. We sent messengers out for them, but neither they nor the messengers have reported back.\u201d\n\tTherelen was out in the Wilds at the edge of the Commonwealth, and Vistia was investigating the Forest of Secrets, Kellis thought, even with direct portals it would probably take some time for them to return.\n\t\u201cDo I have the Council\u2019s permission to cast magic? I would like to see if I can speed the process of recalling the other High Mages.\u201d At Ambervaren\u2019s nod, Kellis set down their valise and drew a complicated geometric figure in the air, a faint trail of light from their fingertip creating the design of the communication spell used exclusively by the High Mages.\n\tAs the energy of the spell leapt outward toward the other two High Mages, they looked to the Council. \u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s going on. I gather that the sun doesn\u2019t seem to have risen, but I don\u2019t know anything beyond that.\u201d\n\tAmbervaren took a deep, steadying breath, then answered. \u201cWe\u2019re not certain of much beyond that, I\u2019m afraid. The sun hasn\u2019t risen, but there are still stars in the sky and we can see the moons. There aren\u2019t many reports yet from the outlying districts, but closer ones have reported in and they\u2019re experiencing the same things. The temples are trying to reach out to the gods, but at least a few of my advisors aren\u2019t certain the gods will respond, if only because they haven\u2019t spoken in decades. So far, the people in the city are upset, but there hasn\u2019t been any rioting or looting yet. Everyone is\u2026 naturally disturbed by the turn of events.\u201d\n\tAs she finished, Kellis thought, The communication spell should have been answered by now. Something\u2019s wrong. Out loud, for the benefit of the Council, they said, \u201cIt seems that they\u2019re not responding, though I\u2019m not sure why. Do I have your permission to cast scrying spells?\u201d\n\t\u201cHigh Mage Kellis,\u201d Ambervaren sighed wearily, \u201cyou have my permission to cast any spell you need. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the people start to truly panic.\u201d\n\tKellis traced a complicated pattern in the air to their left, and another, similar one to their right. Even if the other High Mages were unable to respond to the magical equivalent of knocking on the front door of their houses, the scrying spells didn\u2019t require a response, much like looking into someone\u2019s window. It wasn\u2019t considered polite, but the unease that Kellis had felt earlier was deepening into a greater sense of worry.\n\tThe communication spell would have woken me from a deep sleep. Please let them be alright.\n\tWhile the energy of the spells sped outward toward their intended targets, Kellis thought of a few things.\n\t\u201cIs the city getting colder? Or the surrounding areas?\u201d\n\tCouncil member Tuven stood, a pained smile on his face. \u201cI also had that concern, High Mage. It\u2019s more difficult to tell in the city, since stone holds heat better than earth, but from the reports I\u2019ve seen from the countryside, it\u2019s neither warming up nor cooling down. Or, at least, not in a noticeable fashion.\u201d\n\tTuven always was the sensible sort.\n\tThe Council member continued, \u201cI also asked about winds and storms of any sort. The air isn\u2019t exactly still, but the granaries report their windmills are barely moving. There was a thunderstorm over Thessal to the west, but it seems to have spent itself over that city rather than moving on as they usually do.\u201d\n\tWhich means the air isn\u2019t moving much either. Kellis asked, \u201cHas anyone reached out to the nature speakers? Our gods are connected to things like love, commerce, and governance, but if they ever ruled over the natural world, they don\u2019t anymore.\u201d\n\tTuven spoke up again. \u201cI sent messengers, but the nature speakers like their privacy. Even the sanctuary closest to a working portal is nearly a half-day ride from that portal.\u201d\n\tKellis bowed to Tuven, who returned it. The other Council members seemed to be calming down, since there was now something specific to focus on.\n\tAmbervaren spoke into the pause, her voice clear and steady. \u201cWe need to focus on the practical, as much as we can. I\u2019m not proposing restrictions on the populace at this time, but I think we should at least make plans for what to do if this lasts more than a day, a week, a month.\u201d\n\tWith a set goal, the Council members started talking amongst themselves, discussing practicalities that faded into the background of Kellis\u2019 awareness as they focused on the scrying spells. By now, the scrying windows should have opened. By now, Kellis should have been seeing their colleagues, whether they were asleep or unconscious.\n\tSomething is very, very wrong, they thought. Carefully, they funneled more power into the scrying spells. They weren\u2019t afraid of using too much magic. They were more afraid of drawing attention to themself. There are only a few things that could blot out the sun and stop the winds. And most of those would notice a scrying spell.\n\tA few moments later, both scrying windows popped open, and Kellis had to restrain a shocked gasp.\n\tTherelen was more visible, even without sunlight. His body lay splayed out on the grassy moors of the Wilds, an expression of terror on his face, and his broken staff clutched in rigid fingers.\n\tThe other window showed mostly shadows, having opened deep in the Forest of Secrets. As Kellis' eyes adjusted, they saw Vistia crumpled on the ground in front of a large tree, body bent as though she\u2019d been thrown against the tree by something much larger than her.\n\tAnd near each of the bodies of the High Mages, a familiar and terrifying mark floated in the air, glowing dim and red, clearly meant to be seen even on a sunless day.\n\tKellis felt faint. \n\tHow did I survive? I\u2019ll have to check the magical wards on my house and the city. That sigil proves this is far worse than I thought. But the Council needed to know, and they fought against the urge to simply pass out.\n\t\u201cMembers of the Council of the Commonwealth of Pellenos,\u201d they started, and a hush fell immediately over everyone in the room.\n\t\u201cI have dire news. The Harbinger has returned.\u201d\n\tAt that, the chamber erupted in sound, and Kellis sank to their knees. If they could find the prophesied hero in time, the world might yet survive."}

For now, scientists are trying to figure out how long the moon will stay where it\u2019s at, or if it\u2019s stuck in this pattern and something may need to be done to fix this.\n        Most people, like myself, were up all night watching the news. I mean, who could really sleep while the fate of the world is in the hands of space agencies and world leaders who normally can\u2019t work together on even minor issues? Most channels had special live coverage that went on through the night. \n        We were all so happy when the bombs hit the asteroid. Outside, you could hear cars beeping, fireworks, gun shots, people screaming for joy in the streets. Everything seemed to be alright. The updates at first were all positive, and the asteroid was moving away from Earth. News commentators were hugging each other and laughing and crying at the same time. I feel like there was a collective sigh of relief that went across the world in those moments.\n        I was about to turn off the news and go to bed when I heard, \u201cThis just in, breaking news, scientists think that something hit the moon causing it to shift out of its orbit.\u201d \n        You hear that, and first you think, alright, a little shift, how bad can it be? After all, I was tired, and it had been a really long, exhausting, and emotional night already since we had been so concerned about the asteroid. I had spent the night wondering if I would exist in the morning so the news that the Moon had shifted didn\u2019t fully register. As it turns out, here I am, but there is no morning because the sun didn\u2019t \u201crise.\u201d\n        So, here I sit on my couch still glued to the news. It\u2019s morning and as dark as it was at 3:00 am. No one has any answers yet, and the news commentators are just rehashing everything we knew a couple of hours ago. \n        A state of emergency has been declared. Everyone except for emergency responders, electricians, and other essential workers are to remain home. The dark, it turns out, is not the only problem at the moment.\n        As soon as it becomes clear that the Moon is blocking the Sun and no light will make it to Earth for an undetermined amount of time, unmitigated panic sets in. Stores that are open all night suddenly fill with panicked people pushing each other and fighting over bread and bottled water. Gas stations have lines that go around the block. Looting is taking place at closed stores. Riots are breaking out with no rhyme or reason to them. It\u2019s utter chaos outside. \n        Gone are the fireworks. All I hear now are the sounds of random gunshots, sirens, and loud ominous booms and popping sounds that I can\u2019t place. I lock my doors and close my curtains. Normally, I complain about walking up four flights of stairs to my apartment. This morning, I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019m not on the ground floor.\n        I get some coffee and return to watching the news. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be able to sleep anytime soon. Some coastal areas are under flood and tsunami warnings, caused by the abrupt shifting of the tides due to the change in the Moon\u2019s location. There are mandatory evacuations in these areas. But for some places, it\u2019s too late, and rescue operations are underway.\n        Here we have severe thunderstorms and a tornado watch. Severe weather was not forecasted for today, so I assume this is some type of fallout from our current Moon situation. Unexpected severe weather is breaking out across the globe. \n        I\u2019m terrified of severe weather, but I feel lucky that I\u2019m not in an area where I have to worry about tsunamis. Flooding might happen here, but I\u2019m on the fourth floor. It at least feels survivable to me.\n        The amazing thing is how much we don\u2019t know right now. Most importantly, we don\u2019t know if it will be possible to get the moon back into its orbit. We don\u2019t know the full ramifications of it being out of orbit. We have a good idea, given all that\u2019s happening, but we\u2019re not sure that this is all that will happen. I wonder how long we can be in the dark before crops begin to die. A few days isn\u2019t going to kill them, but beyond that? I\u2019m sure some scientists have some of these answers, but I don\u2019t and it scares me. It doesn\u2019t seem like the news anchors have any sources on this at the moment. Probably anyone with answers is somewhere trying to figure out what to do right now.\n        In the meantime, chaos seems to be the ruler of the day or darkness. One of the news anchors just got hit in the head by flying debris. It\u2019s not clear if it was some random flying object in the wind, or an object thrown by the rioters. Police are trying to get control of the situation, but it seems to be a losing battle for them.\n        Sirens begin to wail again. I hope it\u2019s not a tornado. The sound is so loud. It is echoing in my ears. I shut my eyes and open them. \n        The room is dark. I\u2019m in bed, not in the living room on the couch. The sound is my phone alarm. I turn it off and run to my window. I peep behind the curtain and there is a faint glimmer of light just starting to emerge. It was just a dream, or really, a nightmare.\n         I\u2019m never reading Hume before bed again. \n"}

It was late April in 1816, and rice planting was in full swing. Though the twin children were only nine years old, their owners expected them to work the same hours as the enslaved adults. Tom wiped the sweat from his brow with his right hand, missing a bead that trickled into his eye and burned.\n        Sally was standing a few feet ahead of Tom, carefully poking the dibbling stick into the mud, creating a perfect hole for Tom to drop the precious rice seed into. As Tom paused, Sally coughed, signaling him to continue working and avoid the ire of the white overseer standing across the field from them.\n        The sun set, and the twins began to walk with the rest of the planting team back to the cabins. Their homes were made of scrap wood and thatch roofs and built on the eastern bluff of the Altamaha River, only a quarter of a mile from the white-columned plantation home of the Hamilton family. Tom and Sally shared their small, one-room cabin with their Auntie, Uncle, and elderly Grandmother, Mama Yaba. Their real mother had been sold not long after they were born.\n        Tom and Sally had no idea how old Mama Yaba was, but to them, she was ancient. She was small and very thin, with mahogany-colored hands that were warped from arthritis. She had raised both the plantation owner and the plantation owner\u2019s father, so they never sold her. Instead, they allowed her to do small jobs around the property in her old age. Mama Yaba wore her hair wrapped in a colorful cotton turban, denoting her status as married, even though her husband had long been dead. She was also the only enslaved person the children knew who had not been born in the Americas. Mama Yaba came from the Dogon people of Mali, Africa. \n        In the evenings, Uncle and Auntie along with Tom, Sally, and Mama Yaba, would gather around the hearth to share a simple stew and leftover cornbread from the morning meal. Mama Yaba would regale the kids with stories of Africa, of the early days of the plantation, of their sweet mother, whom they never knew, and sometimes even of the future. Uncle said that Mama Yaba was descended from a long line of hogons back in Africa. These hogons were people touched by the gods with the gift of sight. They could see glimpses into the spirit world known as Numan where the ancestors would whisper to them of things to come. Sally and Auntie did not believe these stories, but Tom and Uncle did.\n        One evening, Mama Yaba scooped up stew with the burnt end of her cornbread as she told the family of a coming day when the sun would hide from them in the sky. For days on end, the sun would turn its back on them. The ancestors had spoken to her in hushed and smoky voices, saying that when the sun subsides, the children must run. \n        Auntie crossed her arms and scoffed. \u201cMama Yaba, where in the world do you think they will go? Can\u2019t go north. Tobacco country stretches for hundreds of miles. Can\u2019t go west, neither. Cotton plantations are even worse than here. And all that's south is swampland.\u201d\n        Tom looked to his Uncle, hoping for a bit of manly encouragement, but he only stared down at the floor. \u201cMama Yaba, Auntie is right,\u201d Uncle said. \u201cYou are giving these kids a foolish hope. If they work hard here, Tom can maybe become a field lead, or Sally could get assigned to work in the house. But this talk of the sun not rising and them finding freedom is too much.\u201d\n        Mama Yaba just shook her head at her two grown children. \u201cSometimes all we get in this world is foolish hope.\u201d\n        The next morning, Tom was in the barn near the plantation house, filling a burlap sap with rice seeds, when he saw a strange man walk into the yard. He ducked behind the barn door, peering through a crack in the wood. He watched as the overseer approached the man, and they began to chat. The strange man sported a ruffled shirt and a tricorn hat. He spoke in a lilting accent that Tom did not recognize.\n        \u201cI found three more of your neighbor\u2019s boys in the Okefenokee last weekend. They were not too far from the border by the time I caught \u2018em. You may want to rethink my offer for extra guards on the weekends,\u201d the strange man said.\n        \u201cI appreciate the sales pitch, Mr. Alhambra, but we have had no runaways since 1804. After we put down that last little rebellion, our people have been pretty docile. The trick is to sell off the Mamas early. Extended families are fine, but too much maternal influence can breed undesirable loyalties,\u201d said the overseer, shoving his hands into his pockets assuredly.\n        \u201cWell, you may think you have a hold on them, but remember this: if any enslaved person makes it to a town official in La Florida, Spanish law dictates that they are both free and protected citizens of the Spanish empire. I can chase \u2018em for a price up until that point, but then my hands are tied.\u201d \n        \u201cYeah, yeah, we will let you know if we ever need ya,\u201d the overseer said, giving a half-hearted wave, and the two men parted ways.\n        That night, Tom told his family around the hearth what he had heard. Uncle and Auntie had also heard rumors of the potential for an escape to Spanish Florida, but didn\u2019t fully believe them to be true until now. Still, it was far too dangerous, they said. Sally told Tom to try and forget it, and the twins went to sleep early that night in preparation for a long day of planting.\n        The next morning, the twins awoke late, or perhaps early. They could not tell because the rooster did not crow. They walked outside their cabin with Uncle, Auntie, and Mama Yaba to see an unbelievable sight. The sun was gone. In its place was a hazy sky the color of dirty pollen. It was difficult to see, and the world seemed bathed in an eerie twilight. A chill that was unnatural for the month of April blew across the plantation. The landscape was muted, but there was no fog. Tom felt out of sorts, having no perception of the time without being able to see where in the sky the sun actually sat. \n        Mama Yaba gasped. She whispered just loud enough for Tom and Sally to hear. \u201cIt is just as the ancestors said. Now you must run. Go south. Go to Spanish Florida. Find your freedom. Go now!\u201d\n        Tom and Sally looked at each other and did not speak, but in one motion, they ran as fast as they could towards the treeline. They hoped and prayed that the events above them would distract the whites long enough to overlook the daily counts of the enslaved in the fields.\n        The children traveled through forests and down deer paths. They recalled how their Uncle taught them which berries were good to eat and which were poisonous based on the shapes of the leaves. They slept in shifts and remembered the wise instructions of their Auntie on how to build a fire with minimal smoke when they got too cold. They kept as close to the coast as they could, though sometimes they had to walk inland when they came close to a town or major crossroads. The continued lack of sunlight during what they assumed were normal daylight hours aided in their ability to hide.\n        After two weeks of walking, the twins came upon a large town. They heard many English speakers traveling the road in and out of the gates of the settlement, and, fearing that they were not yet in Florida, they again fled inland. They soon found themselves in what seemed like a never-ending swamp. \n        They climbed across this otherworldly landscape slowly. Palmetto-hummocks and knock-kneed cypress trees jutted from black waters. Alligators loomed large on the edges of the soft, sucking mud and the children often had to backtrack with careful, quiet steps away from their scaly bodies. Mosquitos buzzed with a noise so loud it kept them awake and buzzards followed them as if waiting for them to give up the ghost. Tom and Sally felt that the foolish hope their Auntie had warned them about was catching up to them at last.\n        One morning, they awoke to find two Seminole warriors staring back at them. Both of them wore buckskin boots that came up to their knees and headbands adorned with various shells. Their blouses were mud color, blending in with the surrounding swamp. One of the warriors immediately grabbed Sally, hoisting her over his shoulder. Tom yelled, kicking the warrior only to be grabbed by the other warrior who hoisted him in kind. The men then carried the children to a campground in the center of a Seminole village in the heart of a pine forest. \n        The children were brought to a central fire, around which sat four headmen. The men were older and wore bird feather regalia. Tom could hear a mix of languages being spoken behind him, but then one of the elders turned to the children and spoke to them in English.\n        \u201cI am assuming, child, that you have escaped from one of the Georgia plantations. We see your people in this area quite often, though seldom so young. Unfortunately, it is easy to get turned around near the border in the swamps. Our people are not usually camped here, but at the moment we are readying ourselves for a great war to push the Americans out of our lands once and for all,\u201d the headman said.\n        Tom\u2019s lip trembled, but he knew he must speak. \u201cMama Yaba spoke to the ancestors. They told her that we should run when the sun hides. She said if we made it to Spanish Florida, then we could be free.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, son, you have not made it to Spanish Florida. You are in the land of the Seminoles. And while you may be free at this moment, we cannot be burdened in wartime with another child to care for. We have our own children to look after. So now we must figure out what to do with the two of you,\u201d the headman said.  \n        The warrior who had first grabbed Tom stepped forward. \u201cSir, my men need weapons. I have a connection with a French trader on the edge of the swamp. He will likely give us guns in exchange for the girl, but he probably won\u2019t want the boy. Perhaps, we could use him to look after the horses,\u201d the warrior said as he dragged Sally by the arm away from the fire.\n        \u201cNo! You can\u2019t take her!\u201d Tom yelled, reaching for his sister. Sally started to cry. Suddenly, a young Seminole woman pushed her way into the circle.\n        \u201cStop!\u201d she cried out, shoving the warrior aside with a courage that overflowed her small frame. \n        The woman walked up to the headman and spoke plainly, \u201cYou told me after my husband and two children died last winter that you had a vision. You said that vision showed you my family would be made whole. You said that soon the sun would sleep, and two children would reach to me with outstretched arms. Well, here they are. Will you not honor that dream now?\u201d\n        The headman turned to the other leaders and whispered to them in the Seminole language. He then spoke to the warrior holding Sally\u2019s arm, who promptly let her go, muttering gruffly as he walked away. The rest of the crowd dispersed back to their tents, leaving Tom and Sally clutching each other and the strange but brave Seminole woman standing close by.\n        The woman got down on her knees in front of the children. \u201cMy name is Tamiami. I lost my dear husband and my two boys to the pox last year. I wanted to die too, My heart was so broken. But then, Headman Billie had his vision. He has lots of them. And I was told by everyone it was a foolish hope. But sometimes all we get in this world is foolish hope. If you will have me, I will do my best to love you as any Mama should in this life and the next.\"\n        Tom and Sally looked at each other. They were uncertain of their future, but they were certain of one thing: this mother had more than enough love left for them, and they needed it. They reached out their hands, and she led them into their new life as children of the Seminole nation. \n"}

That concept served as a stabilizing point for the entire species, a collective landmark from which to navigate the treacherous wilds of their world.\n        At least, until it didn\u2019t.\n        The day the sun never rose was the day that society broke down. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, although depending on who you ask, the camel wasn\u2019t long for this world anyway. \n        It started on the other side of the globe. There, things were a bit different for the rest of the world. For everyone else, the sun simply didn\u2019t rise. For them, the sun vanished. Just blinked out of existence. No one knew why, or how, it was just gone.\n        A recounting of that day from a woman, who was a young girl at the time, distinctly recalls playing in an abandoned lot next door to her house. She had found a nice wildflower growing out in the middle of the plot, and was excited to watch it grow further. As she bent down to observe it more closely, the light vanished. \n        Most city lights are on a timer. They don\u2019t respond to a lack of light. They only turn on when the time is right for it. So the entire city was plunged into darkness. Naturally, her reaction was to panic. She tried to run home, but the absolute darkness left her stumbling around. While the stars still shone in the sky, without the sun\u2019s reflection to light the moon, their light was meager and pitiful. After an hour or so, she managed to make her way back home. The serious unrest would begin soon after.\n        That city descended into chaos. Others followed suit, but in their own ways. The invisible wave of panic paced itself based on where the sun should have risen. Minor disturbances occurred in the dead of night. After all, moonlight is only reflected sunlight. So when the sunlight left, so did the moonlight, resulting in semi-perfect across the world. As people awoke into this new world of darkness, they would be carried away by the tides of panic.\n        Many had the same story. They woke up to some kind of disturbance outside. The exact nature of the disturbance varied from place to place, but it would always be loud and dangerous. People would go to their windows to see what was going on, and they would bear witness to the chaos outside. Then, they would retreat into their homes and check social media. Viral misinformation spread rapidly about a plot from opposing nations to blot out the sun over the homeland. Others said that it was a rogue scientific plot or terrorist attack.\n        Political leaders acknowledged the unexpected nature of the situation, but urged the populace to remain calm. However, it had little effect. Supermarkets were raided. Fights broke out over basic supplies. None of the production had stopped, mind you, but people just knew there was a disturbance. \n        As the unrest spread, martial law was declared in nearly every country. Riot suppression on a level unheard of before was deployed across the entire world. Even rural communities well away from cities experienced complete upheaval. The unrest continued to grow in intensity despite these statements. Even the streetlights in cities and towns didn't stop the panic. None of it served to answer the question: When will the sun come back? \n        The answer was twenty-four hours after it vanished. In the same city the girl lived in, the sun suddenly popped back into the sky. While it wasn\u2019t immediate, the panic did gradually subside back into normalcy. The long-term effects of the day the sun never rose took some time to completely set in. Massive distrust in the ruling bodies at the time was the major fallout, as well as a new wave of spirituality hitting due to a lack of solid scientific explanation for the incident. \n        Thanks to observation equipment active during the event, scientists were able to learn some things. For instance, the mass of the sun was still there, only the light was gone. If the sun\u2019s mass had vanished, the well-worn celestial clockwork of the solar system would\u2019ve been thrown down a flight of stairs. All of this was useful information, but it didn\u2019t answer the important question. No one could say how it happened, so people turned to explanations of why.\n        But none of that really registered to that little girl. After the unrest subsided, she returned to that little vacant lot. It was her usual playground after all, and after the events of that day she wanted nothing more than to relax. But as she tried to put her mind at ease, she found herself worrying that the sun would vanish again. Despite that anxiety, she kept trying. In the end, she gave up when she laid eyes on the crushed remains of the wildflower"}

","targets":"        The reflection of the half moon danced on the rough waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Waves crashed against the rocky shore of Laguna Madre causing an ominous tower of white foam to rain down in a striking demonstration of the battle between sea and space. High tides had already swallowed the entirety of South Padre Island as a result of the exceptional gravitational pull of the black hole. Most had fled further inland in the forlorn hope of surviving the certain end of the world. But Mona and her father, Joseph, opted to surrender to the inevitable, and if time was kind, catch one final sunrise. \n        Mona developed her love of the sea from her dad, who was an oceanographer. They had spent many days exploring the coast and the Gulf of Mexico. She loved to discover starfish in tide pools and chase crabs in the sand. Most of all, she loved to sit in the shallow waters of the ocean with Joseph. It always brought her great comfort to feel the warmth of the sun on her tanned shoulders and the sea spray lightly beat her feet and legs. Sadly, Parkinson\u2019s disease had robbed Joseph of his mobility and much of his voice. Mona, who cared for her father, wheeled him out each morning and evening to watch the sun rise and set over their beloved sea. \n        Their final sunset together had been tragic, yet awe-inspiring. The black hole did not swallow the sun in one gulp. Rather, the pull of the monster sucked in the matter of the star slowly. In the late afternoon, the outer edge of the sun bulged and looked like it might burst. By the time the sun set beneath the horizon, the matter sucked into the black hole formed a glowing, swirled tail glittering with stardust. A barrage of solar radiation destroyed the power grid. Twilight turned to a surreally dark night. With only the dimming light of the moon, Mona and Joseph were captivated by the millions of stars that shimmered in the most extraordinary night sky. The majestic spiral of the Milky Way shone brighter than they could have ever imagined. \n        The brilliance of the stars increased and the luster of the moon decreased as the intensity of the waves swelled. In an instant, the remaining moonlight was snuffed like a candle.\n        Mona squeezed her father\u2019s hand. She gulped back tears. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll miss the sunrise.\u201d Joseph nodded solemnly. \n        They sat quietly for some time. Mona focused on being present and tried to preserve every sensation she could: the roar of the waves, the coolness of the breeze on her face, the pungent smell of seaweed, the roughness of her father\u2019s hand. \n        \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Joseph struggled to say. His hand trembled as he pointed to the water.\n        \u201cYou wanna move closer?\u201d\n        He nodded. \u201cSit in the ocean.\u201d\n        Mona smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d \n        Mona wheeled Joseph over the bumpy terrain to the shore. She helped lower him to the ground and removed his shoes and socks. He closed his eyes and wiggled his toes in the wet sand as the choppy waters enveloped his legs. Mona sat down next to him and rested her head on his shoulder. She could feel his tremor as he put his arm around her. The briny water burned her eyes, and she savored the taste of salt on her lips.\n        The sun should have been rising. Instead, a bright disc of fire and cosmic particles peeked over the horizon in an eerie glow. Mona squinted at the shocking brightness. Joseph scooted into the water, turned around, and reached out his hands to Mona. She could only see the silhouette against the blazing remnants of the sun circling the black hole. Still, she was calmed by the memory of his smiling face from the thousands of times they had swum in those very waters together. She grabbed her dad\u2019s hand, and they floated peacefully into the unknown."}

She didn\u2019t have a desire to turn over and keep sleeping, and she had to pee. Yet it seemed darker than she could ever remember. She fumbled blindly and found a glass of water and a book of matches on the nightstand. She took a drink and struck a match, lighting the candle by her bedside. \n        Seeing her little sister Anna asleep on the other side of the bed, Vera raised the candle to illuminate more of her surroundings. Stars twinkled in the night sky through the window, but darkness still overwhelmed the room. Vera rose, went to the window, and peered out. She could just make out the gray outlines of the homes nearby. \n        Vera studied the sky, wondering if maybe they were having a lunar eclipse. She gasped when she realized she couldn\u2019t see the moon at all. A dark orb loomed in the sky, but no light reflected from it. \n        After dressing, Vera went downstairs. In the kitchen, she looked at the grandfather clock in the corner. It read 6:15. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely morning,\u201d she said aloud, grabbing a large slice of her momma\u2019s sweet bread on the table and holding it in her teeth. \n        Vera extracted the carrying case of milk jugs from the refrigerator and headed for the front door. She paused and remembered her mother's words about trouble. \u201cWhen there\u2019s trouble, home on the double!\u201d Taking a deep breath, out she went.\n        Vera turned left at the street, checking the small farm over the tall picket fence. She could make out the two cows, and hear the chickens clucking about in the grass, but she couldn\u2019t see them.\n        Vera hummed as she walked, trying to keep her mind off the foreboding darkness. Two houses down, Ms. Olson would be up by now. \u201cShe always appreciates the milk being delivered on time in the morning. Sometimes, she even gives me some honeycomb from her beehive,\u201d she thought. \n        A bicycle went by her, ringing its bell. She nearly tripped, stepping into a garden to avoid getting hit. \n        \u201cHey!\u201d she called out, but the rider didn\u2019t respond. The boy just held a rolled up newspaper aloft and tossed it at the next porch. In a moment, he disappeared into the dark.\n        Arriving at Ms. Olson\u2019s front step, Vera set two bottles of milk into the small chest by the door and then knocked softly. She waited for several moments, then rapped louder. She listened in the dark for another few breaths, and then heard a soft cry from behind the door. \n        \u201cMs. Olson?\u201d Vera said, alarmed. \n        Another moan and a sound like sniffling.\n        Vera stepped off the step and went to the front window. It sat open a few inches, and a kerosene lamp burned on the kitchen table at the far end of the room. She could just make out a figure on the floor beside the couch \u2014 Ms. Olson.\n        \u201cMs. Olson!\u201d Vera cried out, rapping on the window. She froze when a small shadow emerged from behind the sofa, and crawled over the body, resting atop the lady. Vera heard the sniffling noises again and realized they were sucking sounds. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just the dark.\u201d She heard the soft words were whispered from where Ms. Olson lay. The elderly woman\u2019s feet twitched, and another moan made Vera\u2019s skin crawl.\n        Vera slowly picks up her basket of milk, and retreats to the street. As she starts walking again, she is terrified. She wanders until she remembers her mother's words: \u201cWhen there\u2019s trouble, home on the double.\u201d\n        She stops and stands there, shivering.\n        A man about her father\u2019s age comes out of the house she is standing in front of. \n        \u201cYoung lady, are you alright?\u201d the man asks.\n        Vera jumps and looks around frantically. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n        The man cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019re on Dunbar Street.\u201d\n        \u201cI need to get home to Rose Avenue.\u201d\n        The man takes a step towards her, but she backs up. The man points up the street. \u201cYou take a right at the next corner, and then your second left. That\u2019s Rose. Is everything alright?\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s Ms Olson,\u201d she said, almost crying, and moved off into the dark.\n        Vera turned right, staying on the right side of the road. She began to imagine she could see the turn at Rose Avenue, even though she could hardly see ten feet ahead.\n        \u201cJust get home,\u201d she thought. \n        Two more houses go by, and she still thinks she can see Rose Avenue in the darkness. Then she realizes she is in front of the Kincaid farm. They have two grown boys working. It is the same size property as her family's, but they grow corn in the front yard, and have several pigs. \n        \u201cThey need more milk,\u201d Vera reminds herself, leaving four bottles at the front door. \n        Back on the street, she looks around. \u201cNow I wish I had told somebody about Ms. Olson earlier,\u201d she says.\n        Picking up the pace, Vera crosses the street, anticipating the left turn to her house. She trips, and the basket half full of milk bottles topples to the ground next to her. Vera, holding her ankle, sees that many bottles have been broken. She gets to her feet and realizes that she tripped over the front tire of a bicycle. It lay half hidden in the hedge of the Smith house.\n        Vera takes two steps backward, her breath catching in her throat. That\u2019s when she sees another shape protruding from the hedge. She leans down and sees it is a boy's leg, with his tennis shoe still on it. \n        \u201cThe paperboy!\u201d she gasps. \n        Vera runs. A corner ahead turns left, and she almost collides with the sign that says \u201cRose Avenue.'' She runs into her house, up the stairs, and into her bed. She pulls the covers over her head, shivering.\n        \u201cVera? Are you alright?\u201d asks her sister.\n        Vera can only lie there, her breath coming in short gasps.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d says Anna\u2019s slight voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just the dark.\u201d"}

","targets":"        Dear Finn,\n        I hope you\u2019re handling the current situation much better than myself. I\u2019ve been checking the clock constantly. I need to make sure I\u2019m not going mad.\n        I've always considered myself a night owl, but it\u2019s hard to be a night owl when the sun doesn\u2019t rise. As someone who knows me well, you would probably assume that I would relish a day like today. But it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not just that there\u2019s no sun\u2014there\u2019s no glow of the moon or sparkling stars\u2014two things that define \u201cnight\u201d for me. It\u2019s just black. Even my orange tabby, Atlas, who is most lively at dawn and dusk, is confused. He didn\u2019t get to have his dawn playtime followed by his lengthy morning nap. His uptick in energy never came. I can only assume it\u2019s because the night never faded away into a dull blue, followed by the normal pink, purple, and yellow sunrise that brightens the tops of the homes and businesses in town. Atlas is now sitting on top of the couch, staring out of the window, looking back at me every once in a while with a soft \"meow.\" I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s looking for, but I wish I could ask him.  \n        I used to pity my friends who couldn\u2019t stay up late. I was convinced that the night was for creatives such as ourselves\u2014artists, writers, and musicians. But now, I sit here in my own self-pity, wondering what I\u2019m supposed to do with my time during the day when there is no sun and if I\u2019ll feel any different when it technically becomes the time that I normally consider \"night\u201d. Sleeping is out of the question; the kids are up and highly enjoying their day off of school. Yes, apparently, when the sun doesn\u2019t rise, school is canceled.   They haven\u2019t yet realized how catastrophic this can become, and I\u2019m too much of a coward right now to tell them. I need to give it more time before I drop this potential bombshell. \n        I\u2019ve been listening to the reports all day, and still, there seems to be no answer. There are a lot of conspiracy theories floating around, jumping from mouth-to-mouth and ear to ear and home to home, but there\u2019s no solid reason or evidence for this yet. I was scrolling through social media this (dare I say, morning?) and mentions of the apocalypse, the rapture, and some type of government conspiracy were being posted. It\u2019s hard for me to believe any of this stuff. I would rather think there\u2019s something way more scientific behind this, hopefully that can be fixed by NASA or, perhaps, the government. But, at this point, it could be anything. No one really knows for sure. \n        Even though I always considered the sunrise beautiful, I\u2019m sure you remember from college how much I hated waking up in the morning. When a person is  used to waiting for the quiet of the evening so they can concentrate on the things that bring them solace, early-morning wake-ups are never easy. Remember how I would mumble and groan while hitting the \u201csnooze\u201d button on my alarm clock over and over? Eventually rolling out of bed, my hair usually in some knotted, falling out bun or ponytail; my eyes red from the lack of moisture? None of that has changed. I always look crazy while standing with my kids at the bus stop. Other moms are well put-together\u2014 freshly showered with perfect make-up, blow-dried hair and painted nails; usually wearing some expensive blazer with slacks and heels. I wonder what they\u2019re all doing now. I can\u2019t imagine anyone making themselves look perfect on a day like this.\n        Look at me, writing as though this has been going on for days. It\u2019s only been a few hours, and I already feel batty. I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like if this continues. Will my body know when it\u2019s technically night, or will I be stuck in this strange, cosmic, disoriented state, where I don\u2019t know when to shower or write or even go grocery shopping? What if I never write to you again? I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cBut, you have a clock! You know what time it is.\u201d That doesn\u2019t matter, Finn. If anything, every clock in my home is laughing at me today. I think I\u2019ll turn them all off; I can\u2019t stand the tick-tocking of a supposed \u201cday\u201d passing me by. \n        I\u2019m feeling achy, probably from a lack of vitamin D. Oh god, am I being a hypochondriac? Too dramatic about it all? I mean, the sun\u2014the sun\u2014didn\u2019t rise today. What if it never rises again? What if we\u2019re stuck like this? What if my kids never go to school again, and I am forced to homeschool them? I mean, really. Could you picture me as a teacher?\n        I think I might step outside for a bit to see if that clears my mind.\n        Okay, that was a mistake. A big one. \n        I stepped out onto my front lawn. The grass is full of dewdrops that never dried. The air is foggy and damp; a heavy mist stayed dancing on the street, with no signs of clearing. I looked to the sky, hoping to see some semblance of light. There still isn\u2019t even a hint of the sun, moon, or stars. It\u2019s a blank, onyx canvas\u2014an empty void. If I\u2019m being honest, looking at such a thing scares the living daylights out of me. The thought of disappearing into a vacant oblivion is terrifying. \n        I started to walk down the street, and in the distance, I could hear what sounded like car crashes and sirens. People are screaming. Dogs are barking. The sheer screeching sent piercing waves through my eardrums. If anarchy hasn\u2019t started yet, I\u2019m sure it will soon, unless the sun decides to make an appearance within the next four hours. Even by that time, we\u2019ll only have two hours of daylight before it gets dark again.\n        My street is eerily quiet. On a normal near-summer day, people are outside in their yards, tending to their gardens, washing their cars, or walking their dogs. Old Jane, four houses down, often sits on her porch in her robe with curlers in her hair, petting her fluffy, Russian Blue cat, watching out for potential gossip. Kids are outside on their bikes or running around, falling and scraping their knees. But today, there\u2019s no one tending to their gardens\u2014I can\u2019t even see the blue tulips and white roses that adorn the Johnson\u2019s yard. No kids are circling on their yellow and purple bikes. Presumably (and understandably), no one is allowing their kids outside. No one\u2019s driveway is full of dripping bubbles as they finish up waxing their black and red sports cars. There is no sun to illuminate the usually lustrous world.\n        It just occurred to me\u2014what about the environment? We have to keep most of the lights on all day to be able to see in the house. I would rather not burn candles. Having candles burning constantly is dangerous, especially with the kids\u2019 feet thumping upstairs as they hop on and off beds and have dance parties with very loud music. And my poor, confused Atlas, jumping on every surface he can, his body begging for its regular schedule back. I\u2019m scared the candles will get knocked off and burn the place down. The energy from every house being lit up all at once for a whole day can\u2019t be environmentally friendly, but what else are we to do? With no sun, we have no choice. \n        Finn, this \u201cday\u201d has made me realize how essential the sun is for writers and artists. We need the world to be luminous so that when the daylight does fall, we can write or paint, thinking back on everything we saw that day. I fear that if it stays this way, creativity will wane. I\u2019m sure there are some visionaries out there who luxuriate in these kinds of phenomena. They can take any mysterious happening and turn it into something beautiful and amazing, and be praised for it for centuries to come. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m one of those people. I sincerely hope you are.\n        Well, there\u2019s a knock on my door. If you don\u2019t hear from me again, it\u2019s either because my town has gone into a complete anarchical state or because I\u2019ve been driven mad by lack of creativity, screaming kids, and no sunlight. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not the case. \n        I think I may just stay up to see if the sun rises tomorrow.\n        Your Friend,\n        Olivia Parker\n"}

Well, is it nice out there?\u201d\n        Slowly, Lomglack stepped forward. \u201cYes, it is. My daughter and I visited Sebalea once. The weather is often unpredictable, but Sebalea was relatively calm during our stay.\u201d\n        Silence permeated the room. I glanced behind me at Kipcop, the closest thing to a friend I had in this whole office, but they refused to look back at me.\n        \u201cYou say it has unpredictable weather?\u201d Gobgram questioned.\n        Lomglack nodded, her antennae gently swaying. \u201cYes. Alpha Centauri in general is prone to random, intense storms.\u201d\n        Gobgram appeared vindicated. \u201cOh,\u201d he loudly responded, \u201cso maybe humans shouldn\u2019t live there?\u201d\n        Lomglack, nor anyone else in the office, replied. I could barely stand the growing pressure, wishing he\u2019d just come out with it and reveal what happened. I had a hunch about the mistake I\u2019d made, but I couldn\u2019t imagine anything I did would result in such a catastrophe.\n        \u201cSomeone,\u201d Gobgram yelled once more, \u201capproved incorrect coordinates for Earth\u2019s operating system. It only takes a few invalid numbers to disrupt planetary order.\u201d\n        He linked two tentacles behind his back and began to pace. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to manage a solar system, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done best. There are errors here and there, but nothing too considerable. We\u2019re successful more often than not. For instance, in the long history of the Earth Project, it has never once left its solar system. We keep it revolving around its sun. It always rises.\" He stared out the window at our solar system\u2019s crimson sunrise. \u201cEvery day but this one.\u201d\n        Quiet gasps sounded across the room. I noticed Kipcop putting their paws to their shocked face, and I felt a sudden stab of guilt in my stomach.         Kipcop put more effort into the Earth project than any other member of the team. What could have gone wrong yesterday? My mind raced, recalling all the work I\u2019d done.\n        I had a chilling thought: did I set yesterday\u2019s coordinates right?\n        As the realization dawned on me that I\u2019d probably executed it wrong, Gobgram finally turned to look at me. I watched a vein on his forehead throb in palpable anger.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s coordinates like these,\u201d Gobgram gestured to my desk and raised his hand into the air, causing a series of illuminated numbers to appear in the air at his left, \u201cApproved by lazy engineers like you, Billy, that caused Earth to go rogue last night and start a thousand-year trajectory towards a solar system it can\u2019t survive in!\u201d\n        Everyone stared at me, and I quickly stepped forward to object. \u201cThat\u2019s totally unfair, I was doing the work of three beings since Borbom and Plinklat were out sick! I\u2019ve had to modify regional temperatures for almost half the globe, retune the Northern Hemisphere eclipse, and\u2026\u201d placing a hand on my chest, I professed, \"I, alone, had to save the Earth from a deadly meteor!\u201d\n        Gobgram tightened his tentacles in frustration, glaring at me. \u201cHumans anticipated a meteor. They were doing what they could to prevent it. They have no concept of how to move their planet back to where it was!\u201d\n        I threw all three of my arms up in anguish. \u201cThey would\u2019ve died, I didn\u2019t know what to do! I tried to send the meteor towards Alpha Centauri. They have the technology to handle such threats.\u201d\n        Gobgram put a tentacle to his knitted brow, closing his eyes and pushing and lifting the suckers in a self-soothing temple massage. \u201cWell, Billy, you sent something far bigger. Agents from Earth report that the entire globe is in a massive panic. Half of them expected an eclipse, and the other half was trying to keep a meteor from decimating their population. They didn\u2019t need to go barreling through space towards a solar system over four light-years away!                 I\u2019ve never used emergency processes in all my time here, but I had to use them this morning to save eight billion people.\u201d \n        He walked closer to me, causing everyone else to back away. \u201cDo you understand the gravity of the situation? This isn\u2019t just a basic error. The Earth didn\u2019t see its sun. The sun just didn\u2019t rise in the morning, the way it has since the planet\u2019s origin. Humans are convinced the world is ending.\u201d \n        I opened my mouth to reply, unsure how to plead my case. Even if I could barely do this job right, I wasn\u2019t sure I could do much of anything else. I didn\u2019t see a future for myself beyond working at Xiovin. I\u2019d wanted to work there my whole life. Though I wasn\u2019t enjoying it as much as I thought I would,  I figured that it would improve. As I stood there, my hopes for a happy career there rapidly diminished.\n        \u201cI mean. It\u2019s not out of the question, with everything that\u2019s been going on there,\u201d I began, but he quickly interrupted me.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d Gobgram bellowed. \u201cThere\u2019s a firm plan in place. Your ineptitude has risked a priceless accumulation of data! Not to mention eight billion humans!\u201d\n        Scoffing, I turned to face my coworkers. \u201cI was trying to save them!\u201d I replied, looking around. \u201cMisrouted coordinates are a common mistake. How did         a meteor come flying towards us in the first place without warning? I didn\u2019t get sufficient warning!\u201d\n        Glinglop, a gelatinous blob, protruded a long, dripping green limb at me. \u201cYou must not have to worry about invalid coordinates when your father is Overlord Xiovin.\u201d\n        Finally, the truth came out. They resented me because of my connections. I stood before my coworkers, completely speechless.\n        Gobgram straightened his posture and sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another meeting this afternoon about planet safety. Earth is being restored to its original solar system, and should return to its rightful place by tomorrow. Our agents know what to do.\u201d \n        The atmosphere in the room began to mellow, but at a glacial pace. He waved a tentacle sharply, and the illuminated numbers above my desk evaporated into thin air. \n        \u201cNobody worry,\u201d Gobgram added. \u201cThe sun will rise again.\u201d\n        I wanted to ask what emergency procedures entailed when he approached me, making direct eye contact with his ginormous purple eyes. I\u2019d never seen them so close up before, and in seeing them then, I noticed webs of glimmering constellations in the black of his huge pupils, as if I were peering off the edge of a dark galaxy. Immense fear quaked through me. \n        \u201cAnd that\u2019s no thanks to you, Billy. You\u2019re on thin ice. Overlord Xiovin will be disappointed to hear about the sun, but even more so to know his own son couldn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\u201d \n        Gobgram left, moving out of the office and into the hallway in a cacophony of sucker pops. \n        I couldn\u2019t let him tell my dad. That would be the last straw. I couldn\u2019t lose this job. It\u2019d be too embarrassing. That, and I needed the money. He cut me off a year ago, and I was barely getting by as it was. No one would fire me without his word, but he might finally give it if he knew what I\u2019d done. \n        Scanning across the room, I realized it\u2019d be an uphill battle attempting to reclaim their trust, not only their acceptance.\n        Maybe this job wouldn't be worth fighting for, but I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of Gobgram relaying such terrible news to my father without context.         Keeping my head down, I exited the office to follow our administrator.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s not very bright, is he?\u201d I heard Lomglack whisper as I left. \n"}
