Alexandra had her nose stuck in another Egyptian mythology book. She was so fascinated with anything ancient and about the Egyptians, she was studying to become an archaeologist one day. However, reality took hold  when her boss yelled, \u201cAlex, get your head out of that book and serve the customers.\u201d Alexandra was a waitress at the local coffee shop on campus, where she studied archaeology. She couldn\u2019t wait to graduate, so she could fulfill her dream of going to Egypt and discovering ancient secrets. \n        After her shift at the coffee shop, Alexandra went to her favorite place on campus, the archaeological archives. She went to the section all the way in the back of the archives, where she would find the Egyptian section. Everything was where she left it the day before when she came down here. She knew it would, because no one ever came down as often as she did; technically she wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the archives as a sophomore. Only juniors and seniors were allowed to access the archives because they were the ones connected to research programs.\n        Alexandra went about her normal ritual of applying gloves and then carefully removing the priceless artifacts from their protective containers so that she could take them into the containment area for further examination. She had learned how to care for delicate items as a child. Her mother taught her how to handle the pottery she just made and she employed those same methods here.  She was carrying a canopic jar to the containment area when someone said, \u201cYou know you are not supposed to be down here.\u201d Startled by the sudden appearance of someone, Alexandra dropped the canopic jar. Its fate was a surprise to both the stranger and Alexandra, for it didn\u2019t break. \n        The stranger came closer, it was her archaeology professor, he went straight for the fallen canopic jar and looked at Alexandra. \u201cYou better be glad this thing didn\u2019t break, otherwisIe I would have you removed from this program and the school. Now, explain yourself, what are you doing down here?\u201d\n        \u201cI was just doing extra research for the paper that is due next week. I wanted to get a closer look at the artifacts to give accurate information on the subject of my paper. This canopic jar is the focus of my paper, and its relevance to the god Horus and his healing powers is what I want to do more research on.\u201d  Alexandra\u2019s explanation piqued the professor\u2019s interest, so he allowed her to continue to analyze the artifacts after hours under his supervision.\n        Until one night, when the professor began to notice a crack slowly forming on the canopic jar. The professor was enraged and decided to pull the plug on her research. However, he did not have her removed from the program or the university, so she was thankful. That same night, Alexandra decided to go back into the archives hours later so that she could get a closer look at the crack to make sure it was actually there. She felt that the professor had become annoyed with her extended need for research and just wanted to get rid of her. \n        Alexandra went to where the canopic jar was being held for further inspection inside the containment area, but what she saw instead was a complete shock. Instead of the jar she saw a falcon; shaking her head making sure she was not just seeing things. But it didn\u2019t change the fact that what she was seeing was real. The falcon looked at her as she approached and then said, \u201cHalt, human, where am I?\u201d Alexandra\u2019s mouth dropped open as she tried to fathom the fact that this falcon just talked. Then she began to realize that this was no ordinary falcon, this was Horus, the god of war and the sky. \n        Stammering, Alexandra tried to get her thoughts straight as she asked, \u201cAre you Horus?\u201d \n        \u201cOf course I am, mortal! Who else would I be? Now, tell me where I am?\u201d Horus then jumped off the table where he had been standing as a falcon and then transformed into a man with a falcon\u2019s head. \n        \u201cHorus, you are in New York City, in the basement of archaeological finds at a university.\u201d Alexandra said, still trying to comprehend what was happening. \n        \u201cWhat is this university thing you are talking about, what is a basement, and where is this New York City you are going on about?\u201d Horus gave what looked to be an angry look when his head whipped around to stare at Alexandra. Horus had so many questions that Alexandra couldn\u2019t possibly answer all of them. She thought about calling the professor to tell him what was going on, but then what good would that do her. He would call her crazy and definitely have her removed from the program and the university. \n        \u201cHorus, I know you have a lot of questions, but I think it\u2019s best if I just show you.\u201d Alexandra pulled out her phone and did a search on the web to find a video on YouTube showing the world and its technological advancements in the last one hundred years in less than ten minutes. \n        \u201cSo, you are saying that the ancient gods are no longer worshiped and that our most sacred rituals are no longer performed?\u201d Horus looked confused and disappointed by this fact. He started to walk away from where Alexandra was when he said, \u201cI shall go out into this world and command the people to believe in me again.\u201d \n        \u201cWait, Horus, that may not be a good idea. After all, you are not in Egypt and things have changed a lot since you were in Egypt.\u201d Horus turned around and looked at Alexandra with disappointment as she finished speaking to him. This was abnormal for him, never had he had to have a conversation with a mortal for this long without them worshiping him. \n        \u201cAlright mortal, what do you suggest then? I need to see this world with my own eyes to see how things can be returned to what they once were.\u201d Horus was determined to see the world, even if it had changed so significantly. \n        It was a good thing it was Halloween, Horus wouldn\u2019t be hard to hide. Plus, there weren\u2019t that many people out at this hour of the night.\n        As they left the archaeological building and started to walk down the street, Horus' head kept making those sharp movements looking at everything in complete shock or amazement. He looked down at Alexandra and said, \u201cWhat have you humans done to our once-beautiful world? All of these unnatural things, and what is that smell?\u201d \n        \u201cAs I told you, Horus, we have made many advancements throughout human history. Yes, I admit we have kind of destroyed this world in the process, but here we are.\u201d Alexandra said, feeling Horus\u2019 massive disappointment.\n        \u201cThere is nothing I can do here, you humans have damaged this world too much.\u201d Horus then transformed into his full falcon form and perched himself gently onto Alexandra\u2019s shoulder, so that she would not be harmed with his pointy talons. \u201cPromise me this mortal, do not forget about us. You all may have lost your way to us, but we will always be with those who remember us.\u201d Then Horus flew off into the sky and disappeared. \n        The next night, Alexandra went back to the archives in the middle of night, there was no news of a stolen artifact. She wondered if anyone had even noticed it was gone. In the containment area, she saw that the canopic jar was in the same place it had been before it transformed into Horus. On closer examination, the crack was gone and to her surprise there was a new image on the jar which resembled her and the falcon on her shoulder. She smiled and said to herself, \u201cI will remember.\u201d"}

In the story, the main character meets Apollo, a god from Greek mythology. At first, Apollo appears to be a normal human, and he forms a romantic relationship with the narrator's best friend. Later, he reveals his true identity to his beloved. She wants to end the relationship, so he curses her. He gives her the gift of prophecy but ensures that no one will believe her. ","targets":"        It was all my fault. I am the one who made Cassie go out the night she met Apollo.\n        My favorite DJ was playing at the Sol Club in downtown Chicago. Cassie was not usually the clubbing type, but I had driven all the way into the city from the \u2018burbs, and talked her into going. \u201cYou\u2019re so boring. You\u2019re always in that dumb lab,\u201d I teased her.\n        \u201cFine, club rat. Let\u2019s go,\u201d she teased me back.\n        Cassie and I both spotted Apollo from across the room. Of course, at the time, he just looked like a normal guy. I mean, he was a cute dude, but he was still just a dude. \n        I have to admit that he had rhythm. I remember her saying something like, \u201cHey, Agnes. That guy can actually dance.\u201d  \n        I had a boyfriend at the time, but Cassie was single. I pressured her to approach him and watched from the bar as the two of them danced. They were a gorgeous couple and moved effortlessly together. \n        As the bartenders yelled out \"last call,\" they exchanged numbers. His name was Kavi and he was from Greece. On the cab ride home that night, she couldn\u2019t stop giggling.\n        Over the next few months, Kavi was all Cassie talked about. They were both huge science nerds. She was getting her PhD in environmental science; he had just moved from Athens to start med school. They started hanging out all the time. I liked that he was supportive of her research. He would often chill with her in the lab, and he even helped her with her document review. They also went on all kinds of really cool dates. He was a total music junkie. They were always going to concert. Suddenly, my nerdy friend was going backstage with big-deal musicians and obsessing over bands I'd never even heard of.\n        For a while, Cassie made it sound like Kavi was almost too perfect. He was good at everything! He could play the guitar and the violin. Not only that, but he started writing her beautiful, personalized poetry. They\u2019d get into these long, deep, philosophical conversations. And, of course, she said he was amazing in bed. She even described him as having a glow. I was a little jealous, but Cassie was my best friend and no one deserved happiness more than her.\n        However, she told me some weird stories about Kavi too. She called me after they went away together for a weekend. He surprised her by taking her to an archery range in Wisconsin. When she told me about it later, she said that he was \u201cfreaky good\u201d with the bow and arrow. During that same Wisconsin trip, they went hiking, and she twisted her ankle. All he did was hold her ankle in his hands, and literally all the pain dissipated immediately.\n        \u201cWhat, does he have magic fingers?\u201d I asked her, lightly mocking. She laughed and agreed that she sounded a little crazy. However, after that weekend, she started acting a bit distant. I called her and told her that I was coming in to visit, whether she wanted me to or not. She invited me to go out to dinner with her and Kavi later that week.\n        I met them at a super cute restaurant in Greektown. As soon as I saw her, I knew that something was off. The food was delicious, and Kavi was as charming as ever, but Cassie was being weirdly quiet. After dinner, Cassie said goodnight to Kavi and then took me back to her place so we could talk alone. That was when she finally broke the news to me.\n        A few weeks before, Kavi came to visit her in the lab. After the other overworked grad students left, Kavi started passionately kissing her. He told her that he had something to confess. He said that he was in love with her and that he wanted her to know the real him; he'd been lying to her since the beginning. In fact, she didn\u2019t even know his real name. He truly was Apollo, the god of the sun, and a son of Zeus. \n        When she first said this, I started laughing. \u201cVery cool! You\u2019re dating an Olympian\u201d I said. However, a moment later, I stopped. Cassie\u2019s expression was dead serious. There was a terrible expression of fear in her eyes.\n        She started visibly shaking as she told me the strangest story I\u2019d ever heard. She said that, after he revealed his true name, she had seen him fully transform-- right in front of her eyes. His human body dissipated into thin air, and in its place was an almost blindingly brilliant white light. The light began singing to her in an unearthly voice. All of a sudden, this beam of light consumed her. The light was all around her; then, it was inside of her body. She said she could feel an unearthly energy filling her and shooting through all of her nerves. It was too much. Her head felt hot. Her vision blurred. She thought she was about to pass out. \n        Finally, the supernatural light moved out and away from her. She saw it gather across the room and take the familiar shape of Kavi\u2019s body. Ever since, she hadn\u2019t been able to look at him without feeling this overwhelming sense of danger.\n        Of course, I was worried about her. That night, I tried to get her to let me stay over, but she told me she wanted to be alone. \n        The next day, I texted her. \u201cI think you should talk to a doctor about this vision.\u201d\n        She responded, \u201cApollo told me that you wouldn\u2019t believe me. No one will.\u201d Her words left me with a chill.\n        I called her. The first thing I said, using my most casual tone, was, \u201cSo what? You think your hot new boy toy is a god?\u201d\n        \u201cThe god of the sun, poetry, and music,\u201d she said in a flat tone.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re freaking me out,\u201d I said, trying to laugh. \u201cKavi is just some guy. Cassie, is he doing something to you? Are you on something?\u201d I asked.\n        \u201cApollo has given me a gift, Agnes,\u201d she said. Her voice felt so far away. \u201cHe has made me a prophet. I can see things so clearly now.\u201d\n        Over the next few days, she ignored my texts and calls.  A week later, I got a call from one of her grad school friends. Cassie had just lost her job at the research lab because she showed up at an academic conference, openly weeping and yelling at everyone about a super-storm that would hit the West Coast and kill thousands. \n        I called Cassie for the hundredth time that week, but again, my call went straight to voicemail. I showed up at her apartment, but no one answered. When I stopped by her landlord\u2019s office, he told me that she had missed her last rent check. He hadn\u2019t seen her. No one had.\n        Months later, I was shocked to see Cassie\u2019s name pop up on my phone. I rushed to answer it. I was so relieved to hear her voice at the other end of the call that I almost did not register the words.\n        \u201cAgnes, Apollo cursed me. I tried to leave him, but it cost me everything. These visions! They are so real. But no matter what I say, no one will believe me! But you have to believe me. I saw you die, Agnes. I know it is going to happen.\u201d I could hardly believe that this madwoman\u2019s voice belonged to my brilliant best friend.\n        \u201cCassie, where are you? I am coming to get you right now.\u201d  I felt tears come to my eyes as I spoke.\n        \u201cI need you to promise me that you will not leave your house today. Promise me.\u201d Her voice sounded strange, distant, and almost unworldly.\n        \u201cCassie, please tell me where you are. I am so worried about you.\u201d I was pleading with her.\n        \u201cAgnes, I had a vision. You need to believe me. If you leave, something terrible will happen to you. Please stay home,\u201d her voice sounded hysterical. Then I heard it\u2026 a quiet sound in the background behind Cassie. \u201cBoarding flight 1213 to Athens.\u201d\n        The airport. She is at the airport. As I was registering this thought, I yelled into the phone, \u201cStay right where you are! I'm on the way to you.\u201d\n        \u201cNo! Please. Agnes. Stay home!\u201d she cried.\n        I raced out of my front door, still on the phone. I needed to get to Cassie before it was too late.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t get on that plane. I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d I said to my friend.\n        \u201cNo! Agnes, please turn back.\u201d\n        Those were the last words I heard before the screech of tires and the flash of lights.\n        Now, from the underworld, I look up at her. I watch. She climbs Mount Parnassus to find the ruins of Apollo\u2019s temple. Apollo appears before her, in all of his Olympian splendor. I cry for her as he cruelly ignores her pleas. She has vision after vision. She sees the oceans rise and pandemics rage. She mourns for me. No matter what she does, Cassie, like so many before her, can not escape Apollo\u2019s curse of prophecy. She will always know the truth, and no one will ever believe her.\n"}

I mean, I could count, but when your dad is career military, you kind of lose track? Schools, neighborhoods, restaurants \u2013 they all blur into each other after a while. Even after I got into my first pick university, dorm life meant I shuffled from building to building each year. It was odd making friends my first year at the university, knowing that they\u2019d be around the next year.\n        But no place ever felt like home, you know?\n        I\u2019ll admit, by the time I\u2019d graduated, I wanted something a bit more stable. Okay, a lot more stable. My little brother (little by a year, but hey, he was still younger than me) absolutely thrived on the nomadic lifestyle. For him, it was always about new places, new experiences, and even figuring out \u2013 with a spreadsheet, the big nerd \u2013 the regional variations in the nationwide fast food places. He got the passion for numbers and I got the passion for language, so clich\u00e9, right? And Mom and Dad were really proud of both of us for getting into higher education.\n        Weirdly, though, after I got done with undergrad, I moved across the country; I wanted to study linguistics and mythology, and the only place with a linked program was in California, the San Francisco Bay Area to be precise. Dad was pretty concerned about me finding a job, but I assured him I knew the risks, and even got my brother\u2019s help with the charts and diagrams. Matt, meanwhile, had gotten deeply into the computer sciences, and had a job waiting for him once he got his Masters in that field. \n        \u201cYeah,\u201d he said with a laugh on our weekly video chat, \u201cyou\u2019re the one that moves again, and my university and job are both right here where Dad\u2019s stationed.\u201d\n        \u201cThe job you\u2019ve got lined up gives you plenty of vacation time, the pay to match, and they\u2019ve also threatened you with trips to other locations once you\u2019re settled in.\u201d\n        \u201cOh no, twist my arm!\u201d He laughed, then softened a bit. \u201cHey big sis? I hope you find a good place to land. Like, I know you\u2019ve got an apartment and all, but somewhere you can stay and find home.\u201d\n        I didn\u2019t quite start sobbing, but I know he saw the tears on my face. \u201cTrying, one day at a time. Take care, Matt.\u201d\n        \u201cYou too, Chelsea.\u201d\n        But I\u2019ll admit, I was a complete fish out of water. Nothing I\u2019d ever lived through prepared me for living in a place like this. Sure, the usual fast food was available, but I swear on one street alone, I saw so many restaurants for cuisines my parents hadn\u2019t even thought to mention might exist. Coffee shops, the second home of the grad student, were just as mysterious to me, with maybe one in ten belonging to a nationwide chain I could recognize. My apartment was a converted sushi restaurant, for goodness\u2019 sake!\n        It wasn\u2019t until near the end of my first year that things settled enough for me to do a bit of exploring on the weekends. North of the campus, there were some interesting shops and places to eat, at least in the first few blocks from campus. East were more residences. West was where the more recognizable businesses were, and that had been where I\u2019d been mostly hanging out. I lived south of the campus, but never really looked around, thanks to being mostly head down in my studies.\n        But one Saturday morning, I decided to look around my neighborhood. The tourists hadn\u2019t really started coming in yet, the fog had mostly given way to springtime sunshine, and it felt like the perfect day to go exploring. \n        I meandered a bit up and down the streets, no clear plan in my mind. Matt would\u2019ve had a chart, a grid, and a walk path all set up, but me? I wanted to actually see everything around me, experience things for what they were. Plus, most of the shops and restaurants wouldn\u2019t be open at nine in the morning, so there shouldn\u2019t be anything to tempt me from my wandering.\n        Until I saw this one caf\u00e9, open and bustling, named Hestia\u2019s Hearth.\n        The Greek myths had always been my favorite; the one big book of Greek myth for kids survived all our moves, and had a comfy place in my limited bookshelf space. And Hestia was the goddess of the home and hearth, even if there wasn\u2019t a lot of information about her beyond that. So of course I went in, for curiosity\u2019s sake if nothing else. \n        My first impression was of people and sound. So many people, not just students, but residents young and old from a city that prized diversity. And while there were lots of people, it wasn\u2019t loud, more like a thrum of multiple conversations where nobody had to raise their voice to be heard.\n        Looking around more, I saw the available wall space was devoted to community boards, displays of art, and various other signs of a welcoming space friendly to the marginalized and others on the edges of society.\n        And then I spotted the hearth. Right in the center of the room, a raised circular flagstone thing, cleverly designed to look like a working fireplace. The tables around the hearth were full from what I could see; when one person got up, there was a relaxed pause, and then another person who\u2019d just gotten their drink went and took the open spot.\n        I had never, ever been in a place like this before. It felt comforting and welcoming, like Ithaca must have seemed to Odysseus, though his return to the island after twenty years was shrouded in night and secrecy. Everything about the environment said \u201chome\u201d to some part of me, and I\u2019d been blindsided by that unexpected feeling.\n        Stunned, I moved toward the back of the caf\u00e9. I\u2019d seen the counter and the display case; in the midst of everything else it represented a safe harbor, a piece of the familiar in the midst of the turmoil in my mind and heart. \n        The woman behind the counter smiled at me, black hair tumbled in a braid down her plain white linen blouse, Mediterranean tones in her skin, and her eyes \u2013\n        I couldn\u2019t look away. They were wine-dark, a phrase I\u2019d read so many times and never seen in a way that made sense to me. The world faded around me as I got lost in her eyes, and so I failed to notice when the room stopped. Like, literally stopped.\n        \u201cGreetings, far traveler,\u201d she said in a voice that rocked me to my core. \u201cTravels to put Odysseus to shame, with no home and no wife to greet you with love on your return. He would have quailed at journeys such as yours, and he journeyed to the gates of the Underworld to speak with the dead.\u201d\n        I wanted to kneel. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to spend the rest of my life following her around. Distantly, I wondered if she had any openings for staff in her caf\u00e9. Even more distantly, I wondered how in the name of everything the actual goddess Hestia had ended up in a college town, about as far from Greece as I could imagine.\n        \u201cOh dear,\u201d she said with a hint of amusement, \u201cit has been a while since someone had that reaction on meeting me. Then again, most mortals don\u2019t have an eye for the divine.\u201d\n        I don\u2019t know how I managed to speak in her presence, but managed, \u201cI grieve that I have no sweet wine to pour out for you, goddess.\u201d\n        I felt her grin. \u201cA student of Homer, I see.\u201d With that, I felt my vision expand enough to take her in, and realize that all motion other than ours had stopped. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s too early in the day for wine, at least by this culture\u2019s standards. Your recognition is sweet enough, and if you truly wish to make me an offering, tips are always appreciated.\u201d She winked.\n        I felt drunk, like I\u2019d had a bottle of wine on an empty stomach. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that a goddess would adapt well to the modern world.\u201d I paused. \u201cOr know that I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d\n        \u201cSappho, the dear, is always delighted to know that her island retreat has had such a tremendous impact.\u201d She paused, then. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been easy, you know. The gods fell out of favor, but we never really went away. I\u2019ve always chosen the background, so this suits me. Little brother Zeus took it the hardest, going from the king of the Olympians to another face in the crowd. He\u2019s doing better now; last I heard, he\u2019d become the CEO of a company that generates electricity for power.\u201d\n        She was gossiping with me. The goddess Hestia was gossiping with me, a mortal.\n        She smiled. \u201cWhom else would I tell? All the other patrons, even the ones who\u2019ve wondered at the name of my caf\u00e9, think I\u2019m an ordinary woman with an extraordinary place. It hasn\u2019t really occurred to them that this caf\u00e9 is a hearth for the people who need a home, because most of them have somewhere they think of as home. You, dear one, are the first through my doors in a number of decades with the right combination of scholarship, inclination, and yearning for home.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy siblings are terribly boring, but then again, they probably think the same of me.\u201d\n        Startled, I responded instantly. \u201cHow is home boring? When it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s safe and stable, comforting and welcoming. The certainty of that candle in the window, a beacon for a place of rest.\u201d\n        \u201cDear one, this is why you see me as I am. For so many others who come through my doors, they\u2019re running away from poisonous environments, venomous families, or worse. Despite your wandering, you know what a healthy home is meant to be.\u201d She gestured around at her caf\u00e9. \u201cSo here, all are welcome who need safety, and somehow, rather mysteriously, those who would cause harm can never find this place.\u201d She winked again.\n        I stood there for a while, I don\u2019t know how long. Time wasn\u2019t passing for anyone else, or so it seemed. It took me some time for my mind to do more than spin in loops, more time than that to calm down and wipe my eyes with the tissues she\u2019d handed me. Finally, I managed, \u201cI\u2019d like to stay, if you please.\u201d\n        Hestia started laughing, gently and lovingly. \u201cHave I not made it clear to you, dear Chelsea? You are welcome here any time. I trust your discretion. Though working here, well. I think you need some time to acclimate before you make that decision. Being around me can be overwhelming, even to the faithful.\u201d\n        Faithful. Yeah, that described me right this moment. \u201cI think\u2026 when time starts again, I\u2019ll order? I probably need food on top of something to drink.\u201d\n        She nodded, motion in the caf\u00e9 resumed, and I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich and a cup of the house roast coffee. I tipped. Of course, I tipped. A table right by the hearth opened up, and the old man who left gave me a knowing nod. And the food and coffee were perfect.\n"}
{"example_id":"example_003","inputs":"Write a story, third-person perspective, around 1600 words, about a mythological character meeting someone from the present who has summoned the mythological character through a ritual. The mythological character is surprisingly nonchalant about being summoned. Make the protagonists two archeological researchers who summon Freya from Nordic mythology. She is supposed to find one of them a warrior as a romantic companion, but it turns out the summoner is a warrior in a modern metaphorical sense. Therefore, the goddess brings out the latent love that already existed between the two researchers, and they decide to give themselves a chance at love with each other.","targets":"        \u201cWe should do the ritual!\u201d Leah held up the bowl, a bronze vessel with a pedestal base, about eight inches in diameter. \u201cYou read Old Norse better than I do. What does it say to do?\u201d\n        \u201cI get that your love life is suffering, but wow. You\u2019ve reached the point of summoning nonexistent goddesses to help you fix it? That\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d\n        Annika snickered as she typed in the identification and field notes on a badly degraded metal comb found at the dig site. A whole settlement had been discovered when the largest reservoir lake near Aseral, Norway, began to dry up a few years ago.\n        Leah turned the bowl in her gloved hand. The job of cleaning the items found at the site fell to the two graduate students, and Leah had done a great job with the extraordinary find. The majority of the runic letters were visible in relief on the vessel. She recognized the name of the goddess Freya.\n        \u201cDoes this say we need to fill the bowl with liquor? Am I getting that right?\u201d asked Leah.\n        Annika put down the field notebook and came around the lab table. Donning a new pair of synthetic gloves, she picked up the bowl. She turned it slightly toward the light. \n        \u201cYes. All the instructions are basically on here. We fill it with some kind of alcohol, say these words three times, and Freya is supposed to help you attract a warrior to be your mate.\u201d\n        Leah snickered again. \u201cSo you want a warrior? Okay.\u201d Admittedly, Leah felt a little hollow at the idea of Annika potentially spending all her time with someone else.\n        Annika paused for a moment to weigh her options. \u201cWell, that depends. Do I get a Thor? Oooh. Maybe a Valkyrie? In that case, I\u2019m on board.\u201d\n        \u201cHa ha. Hilarious. What if I call your bluff?\u201d Leah crinkled her eyes in amusement at Annika. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some liquor around here somewhere.\u201d\n        \u201cAre you serious?\u201d \n        Annika had what Leah referred to as \u201cwitchy tendencies.\u201d She was always trying to get Leah to help her perform one of the rituals they ran across from time to time in their research. \n        \u201cI\u2019m holding you to it this time. I\u2019ll go check the storage closet. I think there are some leftover supplies from Dr. Bernsen\u2019s going away party,\u201d she said. \n        Leah rolled her eyes and peered at the bowl, sounding out the runic letters that produced the Old Norse phrases of the ritual. It translated as, \u201cHeart to heart. Life to life. Bring Freya forth. May she find me a warrior mate.\u201d Simple stuff, as usual with these runic charms. They just got right to the point.\n        Annika reappeared with a liter bottle of \u201cOdin\u2019s Skull\u201d brand honey wine, still over half full. At least the ritual would include an era-appropriate beverage. She set it down with a solid \u201cthud\u201d on the black laminate table, and then she fished in her lab coat pocket for two emergency votive candles and a worn box of matches.\n        \u201cWe should definitely light these candles, right?\u201d asked Annika. \n        Leah raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou have to be so extra about everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d Annika\u2019s flair for the dramatic was mostly charming and fun, so Leah found herself going along with it. \u201cBut sure. Why not? Let\u2019s move everything down to the empty end of the table, so we don\u2019t start a fire.\u201d\n        It took only seconds as they worked in tandem to set up a presentable mise-en-place for the ritual. It was as though their hands knew just where to place candles, bowl, matches, and bottle. Leah inspected their work. \n        \u201cThat actually looks pretty nice.\u201d Leah surprised herself. Why do I care how this looks? She shook her head lightly and returned to her usual pragmatic nature. \u201cOkay, so let\u2019s do this. I have a whole crate I still need to catalog.\u201d\n        Annika dimmed the overhead lights, and Leah responded by picking up the half-spent box of matches. She slid open the tiny container and pulled one out, the acrid puff of sulfur filled the air with a momentary flash when she struck it. Her hands moved with a grace that wasn\u2019t usual to her as she arced the flame from one candle to the other. She almost burnt herself, mesmerized by the glow after she finished, but she looked down and shook her hand to blow out the flame just in time.\n        Annika took the bottle and eased out the crammed cork to avoid any sloshing. Leah observed the dramatic pour with amusement as her best friend and research partner dispensed the golden-brown liquid with a flourish. They had enough to fill it about two thirds of the way to the brim. \n        \u201cHopefully, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Leah heard herself say this. Enough for what? This is ridiculous.\n        Annika smiled. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re into this now?\u201d\n        \u201cWhat? No.\u201d Leah noticed that her heart had sped up. Probably just caught up in her friend\u2019s enthusiasm. Admittedly, this was kind of fun. \u201cHere goes!\u201d \n        She turned the bowl so that she could see the writing and do her best to repeat the charm correctly. Nobody actually knows what Old Norse sounded like, aside from the poetic epics, though the Eddas gave some clue through their rhythms and rhyme schemes. Old Norse poets loved alliteration, for example. There were also a couple of codices that translated runic to Latin, so those helped too.\n        Leah pronounced the words but stumbled slightly through the first repetition. The second flowed more smoothly. On the third, her voice acquired a sing-songy quality that felt familiar, nostalgic even though she had never spoken with that cadence or pitch before. As she got to the \u201cBring Freya forth,\u201d part of the charm on that go-round. Then, the bowl and its contents started to glow with a pink haze.\n        The room went fuzzy, and the air above the bowl started to shimmer and sparkle, again in pink. An image began to form behind the sparkling air. It coalesced into the figure of a statuesque lady in a finely draped linen dress, her hair was in blonde waves as if it had just been unbraided. She wore simple gold jewelry, and a leather breastplate. Accompanied by two black cats, she lounged across the wide lab table. They looked like normal house cats, except they were two or three times the size and very fluffy\u2014original Norwegian forest cats. \n        Leah gawked. She had to remind herself that this was happening. She peered over at Annika to see an expression that likely mirrored her own. The woman spoke.\n        \u201cWho summoned me?\u201d Her voice reverberated through the lab.\n        The two continued to gawk until Leah kicked Annika\u2019s foot to get her to respond. \n        \u201cUmmm, this was my idea. Wait, I can understand you?\u201d\n        The lady responded, her voice a little less booming this time. \u201cI\u2019m Freya. I\u2019m a goddess. I talk. You understand. That\u2019s kinda how it works. I travel a lot.\u201d She had a nonchalant air about her. Leah kind of liked her. Kind of a lot. She felt a kind of glow in her chest.\n        \u201cOh no. Oh no, no, no. Wait, am I falling in love with you? This is weird.\u201d\n        Annika exhaled audibly. \u201cGood. I thought I was the only one. It is weird, right?\u201d\n        \u201cWhy did you summon me?\u201d Her voice boomed again. \u201cOops, sorry.\u201d It sounded more normal again. \u201cI forget how loud I sound here in Midgard.\u201d\n        Annika took a breath to speak again. Leah really hoped Annika didn\u2019t say \u201cto see if we could.\u201d That felt like it might not go over well.\n        \u201cI summoned you with the warrior mate charm. So, uh, yeah. That\u2019s why I summoned you.\u201d\n        \u201cThe warrior mate charm.\u201d Freya repeated the would-be title like she was trying to remember it. \u201cOh, yes. To bring you a warrior mate.\u201d The cats circled around her reclined form. One settled near her legs.\n        Freya looked at the two of them and then again at Annika. \u201cYou already have one.\u201d\n        Annika\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What?\u201d\n        Freya crinkled her eyes, smiling at Leah, whose eyes also widened, then narrowed as she peered at the goddess. \u201cWait. You think? You think we\u2019re a thing. Wait, uh.\u201d\n        Fine. Leah adored Annika. She always had. But really, who didn\u2019t? Right? Right? Oh no. That glowy feeling again.\n        \u201cFreya! Did you love spell me?\u201d\n        Annika looked anxious. \u201cUmm, maybe I did?\u201d\n        Freya laughed. \u201cNo. My presence brings out the potential love that your warrior already feels for you.\u201d \n        Leah felt her face redden. \u201cI mean, uh, she\u2019s not wrong?\u201d This glowy pink love nonsense needed to stop. \u201cOh no. That was out loud, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She fought to regain reason, at least for a moment. \u201cWait. I\u2019m not a warrior. What kind of scam is this?\u201d\n        Freya just smiled.\n        Annika reached over and touched Leah\u2019s hand. \u201cWell, you do take jiujitsu. That kind of makes you a warrior.\u201d\n        \u201cOh.\u201d Leah smiled. \u201cI suppose it does.\u201d She squeezed Annika\u2019s hand in return.\n        Freya smiled at them. \u201cOkay then. My work here is done.\u201d\n        The two love interests responded in unison. \u201cWait! \n         Annika added. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t you want us to show you around? See how Midgard is looking these days?\u201d\n        \u201cOh, honey. I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d The air shimmered pink again, sparkled and crackled, and then Freya and her two cats faded out, leaving them in the glow of the candles.\n        Annika was still holding Leah\u2019s hand. Leah squeezed it again. \u201cSo, uh, would you like to get lunch or something?\u201d"}

The story should be at least 900 words long.","targets":"       The self-doubt was as crushing as the cold air, making Giselle\u2019s lungs ache on her walk home from work. It was the end of another soul-obliterating waitressing shift in the heart of glamorous New York City. She had been living there for four months, and the magic had long worn off. Giselle\u2019s big dreams of being a poet were beginning to feel more like a fantasy. The reality of her life was that she was up to her eyes in college debt, her family was just waiting for her to fail and move back home, and she had to work her butt off in a bougie restaurant just to stay alive. If Giselle was honest with herself, she would see that the light of her poetic ambitions had long been flickering, diminishing slowly into nothingness. \n        This was one of those nights that made her rethink all her decisions. A woman whose bag cost more than a year\u2019s worth of Giselle\u2019s rent screamed at her for not refilling the water glasses fast enough. Giselle\u2019s face was hot with anger as she replayed the interaction over and over again in her head, mumbling to herself, \n        \u201cI can\u2019t believe she called me a \u2018stupid girl\u2019! That hag\u2026 I have a master\u2019s degree!\u201d \n         Her quiet mumbling turned into a full-blown conversation with herself. These were the streets of New York though, so no one batted an eye at the young woman talking to herself and ranting about how educated she was.\n        The symphony of city sounds was in full crescendo. The car horns were brazen, and made more chaotic by the din of people talking loudly on their phones. The percussion of thousands of feet pounding the pavement reverberated through Giselle. The street performers blared their saxophones, guitars, keyboards at Giselle as she walked past. Her head positively ached. The night reached an unbearable, dissonant pitch, and she thought she would double over and vomit right there on the sidewalk.  \n        A single note cut through the noise; her world became suddenly silent and mercifully still. The confusion of the city was wrestled into submission by a delicate crystalline note. Giselle whipped her head around, desperate to find the source of the mystery music. There, under the flickering neon lights of a bodega, a man sat cross-legged with his back against the building. He had his eyes closed and his head tilted up and to the side, as if he were listening to something no one else could hear. He plucked the strings of a worn lyre with well-practiced, graceful movements that seemed nearly impossible for hands so tanned and calloused from a lifetime of work in the sun. \n        Giselle stopped in front of the stranger and searched her purse for a couple of dollars she could give him. When she pulled out the few crumpled one dollar bills, she noticed that the man didn\u2019t have anything in front of him to take tips.\n        Giselle waited awkwardly for a lull in his lullaby. She closed her eyes and listened, ignoring the shoves and complaints from the people trying to push around her on the sidewalk. For the first time in months, Giselle felt lighter, free from the crushing thoughts of how she was going to pay her next impending bill, she felt a room open up in her mind. The new space was as wide and clear as the night sky. In it, words and images bloomed into lines, then versed, then stanzas, until she was frantically scribbling down a poem on a few napkins she had in her back pocket. \n        The music stopped, breaking Giselle out of her fevered writing, and she suddenly felt self-conscious with her poem in hand. The man looked directly at her with an intense stare, and she fumbled her napkin poem back into her purse and began patting her pockets looking for the money she had intended to give him. Giselle found the crumpled bills and extended them out to him.\n        He shook his head and simply said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d \n        She returned the money to her bag, sensing she had insulted the stranger by offering him pocket change for such a beautiful performance. \n        Giselle plucked up her courage and asked, \u201cif you don\u2019t do this for money, then why do you perform here?\u201d \n        He replied simply with, \u201cI do it for people like you\u201d.\n        Giselle felt him see right through her. The vulnerability and intimacy of the moment made her want to simultaneously stay and run away. A sadness in his eyes kept her rooted in place as he continued to speak to her. \n        \u201cYou are a poet,\u201d he nodded his head to the purse where she had just stashed her poem, \u201cI know you can also hear the words and the music of the Muses. You\u2019ve been standing here for hours listening to them.\u201d \n         Giselle was speechless, but he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t look back and think about what you could have done differently. You chose the path of the artist, don\u2019t turn back now.\u201d \n         A light caught her attention from the corner of her eye. Suddenly, Giselle realized she had been standing there for hours. Her hands were completely numb, and the new day was on the verge of breaking. She spent the entire night listening to a stranger play the lyre while she wrote feverishly. \n          Dumbfounded, she turned back to him and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d. \n         \u201cOrpheus.\u201d \n          The rising sun broke out past the building, briefly blinding her. Giselle shielded her eyes from it for a moment. When she looked back, he was gone. Orpheus had vanished into the crowd as the first rays of daylight touched the pavement where he had just been sitting.\n\n"}

Here I am on Earth again, how different things are since the time of Odysseus. Watching them, I can\u2019t help but think that the time of heroes is over. I wonder if they have forgotten me. Clearly, my temple is in ruins. I don\u2019t want to be forgotten. I feel so very forgotten. \n        Then I see Diana with her friend. I have been observing them for a few days. It has been a long time since I have been on Earth, and well, I had to start somewhere. (It is not like I have Zeus telling me what to do at the moment, he does not even know I\u2019m down here. What can I say, I got bored.) Diana is telling her friend that she bought a candle holder in honor of me, Athena. Her friend is very excited. It is just a pink marble pillar that twists, nothing special.\n        They place a white candlestick inside it. They seem so eager to light the candle. Next to it is a picture of an owl. That is my symbol. I hear them talking about the goddess of wisdom and justice and her owl. Alright, not the temple I am used to, but I wish to learn more. I move closer to hear their conversation. They cannot see me yet, I am still invisible to them. I think I will stay this way for a while, at least until I learn more. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t cry Diana, don\u2019t let these powerful men get you down,\u201d Penny said as she rubbed Diana\u2019s back.\n        \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that he, of all people, got the promotion instead,\u201d cried Diana.\n        Penny sighs with exasperation, \u201cIt always happens that way. We all know he has half your qualifications and experience, but he plays golf at the club. He is in the boys club.\u201d\n        Diana, still crying, replies, \u201cThat boys club. It is always about that club. If you don\u2019t belong to it, you are just silenced. It\u2019s as if you don\u2019t really exist. Unless they need coffee, of course. I hope one day merit will be the motivation for all things, but until then my friend, at least we have wine.\u201d\n        Penny smiles as her friend tries to pull herself together, \u201cRaise a glass!\u201d \n        Taking a deep breath, Diana repeats, \u201cRaise a glass!\u201d\n        I am absolutely stricken by their conversation. They battle all day to be heard. If they fight too hard, they are struck down. If they don\u2019t fight, they are forgotten, passed over. They earn less than the males do in the same position. They are called bossy, emotional, witches, and worse when they assert themselves. Then, they are passed over for promotions in favor of the golf buddy. I have learned so much from listening to their conversations. \n        I reflect upon my own experiences throughout the centuries. I always stated my case. Men listened to me when I said what must be done! Where would Odysseus have been without me?! Why can\u2019t these women do the same?\n        I must reveal myself to them. My questions need answers. The only way to get answers is to ask them directly. Once they get over their initial shock at my sudden appearance, we begin to converse. I ask them my questions. Their answers break my heart. \n        They tell me it has always been like this.  In fact, it is really so much better now. In Athens, when I was at the height of my popularity, women were consigned to the home, they remind me. Now, they also work outside the home, doing the same work as men. However, they still predominantly take care of the home even when they work outside. They call it double duty. It is not this way for all women, they tell me, but for many of them, this is their reality. \n        I am appalled. They are surprised. They point out that in mythology, I help Odysseus, but what, they ask, did I do for Penelope? For the women of Athens, who looked up to me, how did I make their lives better? Where have I been, they asked, while they have been fighting for equality, for their rights, and sometimes just for basic recognition?\n        I am hurt and have no answers. Furthermore, I wonder why they light a candle for me when I have so many failings. I failed them, and previously, women like them. It was I that championed the heroes who expected the women to be at home. The same type of people, who in this time, often have that expectation. How did I fail to notice this inequity? Me, goddess of justice and wisdom?\n        Alas, a goddess yes, but a perfect being no. My soul feels crushed. So many people I have failed throughout the centuries. Water emerges from my eyes, what is this?! I am Athena, I do not cry! I am known for my rationality, not sentimentality. \n        The ladies notice my range of emotions, so new to me, but not to them. Their response to my sorrow and regret moves me. They tell me that I am just and wise, a figure of a female with power and agency, someone they could look up to, even If I did not notice them. A heroine they could emulate. The representation of the possibility that one can be successful as a woman, even in an Olympus full of powerful men.\n        I have not been forgotten. However, my mission now is different from in ancient times. I am not to save men on their voyages; rather, I am to inspire people who are never mentioned on those journeys. Not just women, but many more. Countless more. There are still heroes, so many heroes, on Earth in this modern time. They might not make perilous journeys on ship, but they are valiant and fight hard for what is just. They face many challenges. I will champion them. After all, I am the goddess of wisdom and justice. "}

Cow face aside, you\u2019re a handsome guy, but I don\u2019t wanna see that.\u201d\n        \u201cHm.\u201d\n        The vendor grabbed a spare apron and tossed it at the Minotaur. \u201cHere, put this thing on.\u201d\n        After taking a moment to study how the vendor was wearing his own apron, the Minotaur began to tie the garment around his own neck and waist. As he did, the vendor came around the back, tying another apron onto the Minotaur backwards to better cover his rear.\n        \u201cThis tunic has a strange design, but it is quite breathable,\u201d the Minotaur stated.\n        The vendor just nodded. \u201cYeah. Sure, buddy.\u201d\n        Once dressed, the Minotaur turned to face the vendor. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n        \u201cAnthony,\u201d the vendor said, \u201cwhat about you?\u201d\n        \u201cAsterius.\u201d\n        With a scoff, Anthony replied, \u201cFancy name for a fancy schmuck. So, uh, where\u2019d you come from? You just kinda\u2026 appeared, buddy.\u201d\n        Asterius hummed, pondering the question. \u201cOf that, I cannot say. The last thing I remember is trading words with that blithering fool, Virgil, in the sixth circle.\u201d\n        \u201cThe sixth circle?\u201d Anthony frowned. \u201cIs that on Staten Island or something?\u201d\n        \u201cPossibly.\u201d\n        Anthony shook his head. \u201cWell, whatever. We live in a weird world. Sometimes things just kinda happen. Speaking of which\u2026\u201d He gestured towards Asterius\u2019s face with his tongs, clapping them together. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the mask? Is that ugly mug real or something?\u201d\n        Asterius took a step closer. Anthony took a step back.\n        \u201cYou have my thanks for clothing me,\u201d Asterius said, \u201cso I will allow you this impudence once. Do not presume to taunt my appearance again, Anthony.\u201d\n        \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Anthony said. He reached down, quickly assembling a hotdog with all the speed of a streetwise professional. \u201cHere, take it easy. Eat this thing, yeah?\u201d\n        Asterius paused as he looked at the hotdog. He looked back at Anthony, and then looked back to the hotdog once more. He picked it up gingerly, sniffed it with his enormous bull nose, then stuffed it into his mouth in a single bite. One chew, another, and then Asterius swallowed. A moment of thought passed before Asterius turned back to Anthony.\n        \u201cYou clothed me, and now you have fed me,\u201d he said. \u201cI will allow you another pardon, then.\u201d\n        \u201cI, uh\u2026 great. Does that mean it was good?\u201d\n        \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d\n        \u201cRight?\u201d Anthony asked, grinning a prideful grin. \u201cOld family recipe.\u201d\n        Asterius let out a huff of air. \u201cI would not know of such things. My family locked me in a maze that they used to kill sacrifices from the city of Athens. I was used as a tool of death and destruction.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2026 huh.\u201d Anthony just nodded. \u201cThat sounds rough, my guy.\u201d\n        \u201cIndeed.\u201d\n        Anthony looked around, seeing that there was still no one nearby. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019re you gonna do now, Mister Asterius? Now that you\u2019ve escaped from Staten Island, I mean.\u201d\n        \u201cOf that, I know not,\u201d Asterius stated. \u201cThis world is unknown to me.\u201d\n        Anthony took a moment of consideration, then asked, \u201cWanna stick around with me? You\u2019d make a great advertisement for the stand.\u201d\n        \u201cI will not be used as another man\u2019s tool again,\u201d Asterius growled.\n        \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa,\u201d Anthony said, shaking his head.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be using you or anything. You have rights. You\u2019d get paid. You\u2019d be a proper employee of the greatest hotdog stand in the world.\u201d\n        \u201cHm.\u201d Asterius bored into Anthony with deep, unblinking eyes before replying, \u201cThis sounds agreeable.\u201d\n        \u201cGreat! Welcome to the team, Asterius!\u201d\n        Anthony extended his hand, and the two new business partners shook on their freshly fastened deal.\n"}

This Scandinavian warrior of the Dark Ages was shocked at his sudden escape from Grendel\u2019s mother. He had just cornered her in her cave, the famed blade known as Hrunting gripped tightly in his hand, when he suddenly felt a tingling sensation in his big toe. The cave went blacker than midnight, as if he had fallen into a deep sleep. But then suddenly he awoke on a cold marble floor with a small, strangely dressed, bald man staring back at him. \n        Dressed in a tweed jacket and matching pants, Professor Alistair Banning could not believe the incantation had worked. While doing research for his latest book on Old English mythology at the British Library in London, the professor stumbled upon a medieval phrase written in the marginalia of a ninth-century work. If his translation was correct, the professor would be able to whisper these words in front of a copy of the manuscript Beowulf, and, according to his translation, \u201che would be rewarded with a true treasure.\u201d \n        After a long day of research in the library archives, the professor hid behind an unusually large stack of 19th-century Victorian romances. Finally, when the security guard went on a tea break around 10 PM, he ventured out and into the ancient manuscripts display area. The professor hovered above the fragile manuscript and only extant copy of Beowulf's saga, illuminated safely behind its bulletproof case, whispered the incantation and stood in silence awaiting the delivery of his treasure.\n        The treasure, as it turns out, was a very large and smelly man dressed in sheep skin.\n        The warrior stood up and said, \u201cMy name is Beowulf, warrior of the Geats, savior of the Danes, and slayer of Grendel. Where am I, and who are you?\u201d\n        Having never spoken Old English conversationally, the professor did his best to provide a response. \u201cSir, you are in a special palace that holds many centuries of ancient knowledge and stories. You have somehow traveled through time to the land once held by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, only now this land is called England. I am a keeper and teacher of ancient knowledge, in a sense. You may call me Professor Alistair.\u201d\n        Beowulf looked at me in a quizzical manner with one bushy eyebrow slightly raised. \u201cNo. I will call you Small Scribe.\u201d Let us go and find the nearest mead hall. We can talk more there.\u201d\n        The professor led Beowulf across the hall and through a fire exit. The alarm bells sounded, and Beowulf shook his fist at the night sky, yelling something about a dragon. The professor grabbed his hand before anyone on the street could notice where they emerged from, and promptly pulled the warrior into The Drunken Fox Public House. Fortunately for the professor, a local brewer was hosting a mead night at the pub. Though the professor could not procure Beowulf's requested drinking horn, he did find a lovely beer stein that seemed to satisfy the warrior. \n        The two sat down in a dusty corner booth at the back of the pub. The professor asked Beowulf if he had any questions about the world around him, but Beowulf had a one-track mind. \n        \u201cWho is your current king, and what is his going price per monster slain? Does he pay in gold? Or women?\u201d Beowulf said as he noisily finished his second mug of mead.\n        The professor said, \u201cWell, King Charles is our current monarch, but I doubt he has a need for a monster slayer.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that, Small Scribe.\u201d Beowulf pulled a long and dirty rag from inside his tunic, unceremoniously wiped his mouth with it, and then tossed it at the feet of a scantily-clad, twenty-something-year-old woman sitting across from them at the bar.\u201d Here you are, wench. A token to keep you warm while I do battle with a beast. Should I live through the night, we will make love on the morn.\u201d \n        As the young woman rolled her eyes at Beowulf, likely thinking that it was not the worst pickup line she\u2019d heard in this neighborhood, the warrior stomped towards the exit, stopping at the bar.\n        \u201cHello there, barkeep. Where does your king live?\u201d Beowulf asked.\n        Wrinkling his nose at the smell of the man decked out in Dark Ages garb before him, the bartender replied, \u201cDo you mean Buckingham Palace?\u201d If you want to see the royal residence, you can probably schedule a tour tomorrow. But they always keep the palace lit up outside at night for tourists. It's a bit of a walk, but if you head three miles that way and take a right at the wooded park, you will see the gates. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n        The bartender pointed directly south as the professor groaned and smacked himself in the face. \u201cWhy did you tell him that?\u201d\n        The professor ran quickly behind the warrior as he walked out the door and into the crisp night air of London. The pair stepped out of the alley where the pub was located and onto the main road. Beowulf stopped in his tracks. He turned pale as parchment as he watched the city traffic conduct its nightly rounds. Black cabs and small hatchbacks intermingled as they merged onto the large roundabouts. Cars pulled up onto the sidewalks. Doors gaped open, and people spilled out of vehicles. Young men and women laughed as they locked arms and ventured off into the various pubs, restaurants, and nightclubs that lined the streets.\n        \u201cSmall Scribe.\u201d Beowulf said this with a quiver in his voice. \u201cYou are either blind or an idiot. There are monsters everywhere. Flying down the path with glowing eyes, consuming people in their mouths on either side of their shiny bodies. Then they scurry away with their prey into the night on rolling circular legs.\u201d\n        With that, Beowulf took off in a dead sprint southward. The professor tried to keep up with him. Who knew such large and dirty feet could move so fast? Out of breath and wishing he had had a pint or two fewer ales that evening, the professor followed Beowulf as he ran past St. James Park. Within minutes, the gates of Buckingham Palace, shining brightly in the darkness, flashed before him. Beowulf suddenly stopped on the edge of the road next to a large truck, likely headed to a nearby restaurant or bar for a late-night delivery.\n        Beowulf had decided that this truck was something different entirely. \u201cAlas! The Mother of all the Beasts. She has come here to swallow up the King, no doubt!\u201d And with that, he promptly pulled his sword from its scabbard, striking the side of the truck with fierce determination. Of course, his iron sword was no match for modern metal siding, though he did give the truck quite a dent. \n        The truck driver rolled down his window and yelled, \u201cAre you crazy? What the bloody hell do you think you are doing? I am calling the police!\u201d The driver had his cell phone in hand and promptly dialed for emergency services.\n        The professor yelled back, \u201cMy friend is a bit agitated tonight, sir. Don\u2019t feel threatened. But maybe lock your doors?\u201d \n        The professor tried to pull Beowulf away from the truck, but Beowulf pushed him to the ground and began striking at the truck again, this time smashing the front headlights. \u2018Take that, foul beast! Now I have taken your eyes!\u201d Then, cutting his hand slightly on the broken headlight, Beowulf screamed in surprise, \u201cWhat witchcraft is this, beast? You have stared a sharp glass into me? I will not be defeated so easily by your trickery.\u201d\n        By the time the police arrived, Beowulf had climbed on the hood of the truck and was jumping up and down as he yelled for the driver to \"flee from the belly of the beast while you still can.\" The police officers promptly tased Beowulf, tackled him to the ground, and took him away in handcuffs.\n        I followed the officers a few blocks to the nearest station. Somehow I managed to convince them that he was my uncle, who had fought in the Falkland Wars in the 1980s and was having a bit of an episode. Not wanting to insult the veteran, and after I very kindly handed them all the cash in my wallet, they released Beowulf into my care just before sunrise.\n        Tired and annoyed, I grabbed Beowulf by the sleeve and pulled him behind me as I set off for my flat. Beowulf continued to mutter about monsters and beasts as I called up my wife on my phone. \u201cHi honey. I'm sorry to wake you so early. My\u2026uncle\u2026came into town and got into a spot of trouble, but all is fine now. He does need a place to stay for a bit. Can you dig around in the cupboard for the blow-up mattress?\u201d \n"}

Her hands nervously pulled at her veil, waiting for him to speak. Hestia was typically left to her own devices and rarely called before the gods, so she was apprehensive about being summoned today. \n        \u201cHestia,\u201d Zeus began, his loud voice booming through the hall. \u201cI am sure you are wondering why I sent for you today.\u201d \n        Hestia peeked up at him, keeping her head bowed. She nodded cautiously. \n        \u201cI have a task for you,\u201d Zeus said, stopping before Hestia. \u201cWomankind is losing focus on what it means to be docile and obedient. I have been watching them, and they are out of control. I am sending you to the modern realm to rein them back in.\u201d \n        Hestia took a step back and raised her head in alarm. \u201cMe, sir?\u201d she asked. Zeus nodded. \n        Her voice trembled as she spoke. \u201cSupreme Ruler, I am but a lowly hearthkeeper. I am not sure if I can fulfill this duty.\u201d \n        Zeus looked upon her kindly. \u201cHestia, my dear, you underestimate yourself. You are the goddess of hearth and home, the immaculate image of domesticity. Who better to show womankind how they are to behave and conduct themselves?\u201d \n        Zeus held his hand up, signaling that their conversation was over. Hestia took a deep breath, nodded softly, and turned to leave the hall. \n        A week later, armed with a copy of Traditional Women in the Modern World and a map of Manhattan, Hestia ventured into the modern realm. She stepped out of a tall structure, looking up at the massive edifices surrounding her. She had spent the last week studying 2015 New York City, but still, she felt overwhelmed and out of place. \n        She looked down at her map again, locating the University of New York campus. Zeus had told her of an event she should attend, the UNY Rally for Women. He had told her that the gathering was for equal pay. Although Hestia was not sure what that meant, she knew it was her duty as the goddess of domesticity and family to defend traditional home life, chastity, family values, and the like. \n        Loud, horseless chariots traversed rapidly in brightly colored rows, causing Hestia to jump back in alarm. She had never encountered such noisy contraptions, the people inside them yelling and waving fists at one another. She looked down at her map again and set off for the place Zeus had circled for her. \n        As she came upon the rally, the sight of it nearly caused her to retreat back to Mount Olympus. There were more people there, mostly women, than she had ever seen in her entire two thousand years. Each person had a big white rectangle in their hands with phrases haphazardly written on them. \n        Hestia folded the map up, placing it in her satchel. She walked forward, pulling her veil over her face, and inconspicuously slipped into the crowd. When she reached the front, there was a makeshift stage and a pretty young woman standing on it. She had a cylindrical device in her hand that was amplifying her voice to a decibel that hurt Hestia\u2019s ears. She covered them with her hands, trying to focus on what the woman was saying. \n        \u201cEqual pay for equal work!\u201d The woman shouted into the device. \u201cPay me what you owe me!\u201d The people surrounding Hestia chanted the words back at the woman, many of them screaming, their voices hoarse with effort. The woman continued to speak, shouting numbers that confused Hestia. \n        When the speaker had finished, she stepped down from the stage, and Hestia rushed over. Clearly, this was the person in charge and the one that others listened to. If Hestia could just give the book to her and explain how womankind could get back to their traditional values and roles, then she could return home and back to the comfort of her hearth. \n        The woman was standing to the side of the stage, speaking with a group. Hestia waited patiently for the group to disperse, and once they finally did, she approached the young woman. \n        Pulling her veil back from her face, she said, \u201cGreetings. I am Hestia, daughter of Cronus and Rhea, Goddess of Hearth and Home.\u201d The woman stared blankly back at her, blinking slowly. \n        Hestia frowned. Why wasn\u2019t this woman responding? She had identified herself clearly.\n        Hestia repeated herself. \u201cI am Hestia, daughter of Cronus and Rhea, Goddess of Hearth and home,\u201d she said again. The woman continued to stare at her. \n        Hestia reached into her satchel and removed the book that Zeus had given her. \u201cThis is for you,\u201d Hestia said, placing the book in the woman\u2019s hands. \n        The woman looked at the book, turning it over and reading each side. \n        \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry, are you a Men\u2019s Rights activist or what\u2019s going on?\u201d The woman finally spoke. \n        \u201cI have told you twice now,\u201d Hestia said, trying to keep the agitation out of her voice. \u201cI am Hestia\u2013\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, yeah, daughter, goddess, I heard you,\u201d the woman replied harshly. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is what you want from me.\u201d She thrust the book back at Hestia forcefully.\n        Hestia smiled beatifically back at the woman. As Hestia had assumed, modern women were not all that bright. Clearly, she needed to speak in smaller words, so this young woman could grasp the ideas that Hestia needed to convey. \n        \u201cI have come from Mount Olympus,\u201d Hestia began slowly. \u201cThe god Zeus has sent me to help you turn womankind around. You have fallen far, and it is my duty to help you regain your way in the world.\u201d \n        The woman snorted. \u201cRegain my way? Listen, lady, I am fine. Thank you, but no thank you.\u201d She turned to go, and Hestia reached out an arm to stop her. \n        \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Hestia said, \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d\n        \u201cSammi.\u201d\n        \u201cInteresting name. Okay, Sammi. Please. It is clear that you are in charge here and that these women will listen to you. Tell them that it is their duty, as women, to be chaste, docile, and obedient. That they should take great care in their homes and take care of the men and the children.\u201d \n        A smile broke across the woman\u2019s face. \u201cOh, okay, I get it. Tommy sent you, right? This is a joke?\u201d \n        \u201cAs I have said, the god Zeus sent me.\u201d Hestia frowned again, her brow creasing. Why was this so difficult? \n        \u201cOkay, whatever, lady,\u201d Sammi replied as she turned to walk back on stage. \n        Hestia reached for her arm.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d Sammi hissed, pulling her arm back. \n        \u201cPlease, Sammi, it is important that you behave like a good woman,\u201d Hestia pleaded with her. \n        Sammi stepped back down from the stage steps and stood face-to-face with Hestia. \n        \u201cListen, Hestia, daughter of Cronus and Rhea, goddess of hearth and home. And listen closely. I am a good woman. I am smart, kind, brave, empathetic, and powerful. And I am fed up with misogynistic ideas of what a woman should or shouldn\u2019t be. So, you can go back to Zeus or whoever and let them know that I will never spread a message of domesticity and obedience for anyone.\u201d\n        Sammi spun around and stepped back up onto the stage, fury radiating from her body. \n        Hestia pulled her veil back over her face, shamed by the fact that she had failed Zeus\u2019 mission. She stood at the bottom of the stairs, watching as the woman spoke to the crowd once again. \n        \u201cFor centuries, women have been told to shut up and sit down. To do what they\u2019re told. To accept less money, less rights, less power. But, I am here with you all today to say we will not be accepting any of that! We will fight for what we deserve! We will not shut up until the paycheck that Jack gets is the same paycheck that Jill gets! Until women are valued, appreciated, and paid what they are owed!\u201d \n        As Sammi shouted, Hestia felt a realization dawning. Why was she here, doing Zeus\u2019 bidding? Being the good girl he had demanded of her? Why wasn\u2019t she more valued, more powerful? Zeus was her brother; for all intents and purposes, shouldn\u2019t they be equals? So, why was he in charge? Because he was a man?\n        As these thoughts flooded Hestia\u2019s mind, she began to get angrier. Sammi was right! She deserved to be treated just as well as Zeus. She decided right then, at that rally, that she wouldn\u2019t do what Zeus said. She would do what she wanted to do, when she wanted to do it! \n        When Sammi stepped off the stage for the second time, Hestia once again rushed over to her. Before Sammi could step away, Hestia grabbed her and hugged her tightly. \n        \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have opened my eyes. Thank you.\u201d \n        Without another word, Hestia turned from Sammi, tossed Traditional Women in the Modern World in the trash bin, and walked out of the park, headed for a future she would build for herself \u2014 one that wasn\u2019t dictated by any man."}

They could have created a magnitude nine earthquake. Would have served them right too.\u201d\n        \u201cYes, dear.\u201d Amphitrite had settled in a chair and flipped to the next page in her book.

For over three thousand years, he had disappeared to his underwater palace with Amphitrite. He kept busy piddling around the house. He tried meditation to deal with his anger. However, he gave up after a few decades (a few days in god years) because he found his own thoughts irritating. A couple of times a week Delphin, his dolphin friend, would come over for coffee and keep him abreast of what was going on in the terrestrial world. \n        Poseidon managed to escape interaction with mortals for the most part. Sure, he produced the occasional hurricane or earthquake to entertain himself. Avoiding people had been good for his temperament and his soul. Over the last hundred years, however, it became impossible to blissfully ignore the mortals.\n        Industrial advancements and increased pollution began to impact Poseidon\u2019s bejeweled palace. The once shimmering gold coral had faded to a dull white. The glistening gems now appeared drab, covered in algae. Poseidon\u2019s anger grew with each passing year.

The consequences did not deter the humans. \n        The moody deity had become unbearable to live with. Amphitrite suggested that maybe some time away from the palace in the fresh air would do him some good. After a great deal of badgering, Poseidon reluctantly agreed. She booked a fabulous seven-day, six night stay at an all-inclusive beach resort in Turks and Caicos. \n        Trident finally in hand, Poseidon and Amphitrite boarded the shuttle to the resort. It was on this shuttle that Poseidon met a nemesis to rival Athena \u2013 Doug. He knew Doug\u2019s name because his wife, Courtney, shouted it no fewer than eighty times on the twenty-minute ride. He also learned the names of their three children, Ethan, Dalton, and Clementine.\n        \u201cCool pitchfork, bro,\u201d Doug said to his new enemy. Poseidon opened his mouth to correct him, but he had already shifted his attention. \u201cDalton, stop trying to push your brother out the window. I don\u2019t care if he bit you.\u201d\n        As a younger god, Poseidon might have washed him away in a tsunami or made him fall in love with a bull. Three-thousand years gave him time to reflect, however, and he decided to spare Doug his wrath \u2013 for now. \n        Once at the resort, Poseidon was eager to sit on the beach with a margarita and relax. \n        \u201cHurry up, Amphitrite! The good chairs are going to be gone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can unpack later.\u201d Beach bag in hand, he rushed his wife out the door. \n        They found two empty chairs in a prime location close to the bar and with an uninterrupted view. Poseidon started to unpack his bag, and Doug emerged from the water waving frantically. \n        \u201cNo, no!\u201d he shouted as he ran on shore. \u201cThose are saved. See our towels.\u201d\n        Poseidon felt the rage swelling up. Amphitrite grabbed his hand. \u201cDo you really need all five?\u201d she asked Doug. \u201cI mean, I expect the kids are going to spend most of their time playing.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, well, see. We got here first, so yeah. Sorry,\u201d Doug said. \n        Poseidon squeezed Amphitrite\u2019s hand so hard that she winced a little. \u201cLet\u2019s just sit over there,\u201d she said pointing with her free hand. \n        \u201cThe view isn\u2019t as good. And look how far away it is from the bar,\u201d he complained. Amphitrite gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cFine!\u201d he begrudgingly agreed. He still kicked sand on Doug\u2019s towel as he shuffled away.\n        Poseidon angrily sipped his margarita as he watched Doug\u2019s family splash and laugh in the waves. As hard as he tried to relax, he just couldn\u2019t let it go. He looked for a team of horses he could command to stampede and ruin their good time. He even considered a shiver of sharks, but he didn\u2019t want to ruin everyone\u2019s day.\n        A flock of seagulls gathered on the beach. They would have to do, Poseidon decided. He telepathically forced the birds\u2019 attention. He raised his mighty hand and pointed to the family playing in the distance. The seagulls abandoned their discarded french fries. Low squawks warned of their imminent attack. The birds circled the family. The squaws grew louder and they swooped and pecked their targets. The children let out piercing screams that excited the seagulls more. \n        Doug and crew covered their heads with their arms and ran for the safety of their empty chairs. The persistent flock followed. The swarm was unyielding, and the family finally had to retreat back to their room to escape having their eyes pecked out. \n        Poseidon let out a hearty laugh. Amphitrite turned to her husband and tilted her head. \u201cReally?\u201d\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked innocently as he gathered their belongings to move to the unoccupied chairs. \n        The second day, Poseidon tried to avoid Doug. He really did. Doug, however, kept springing up, as a nemesis is prone to do. Poseidon awoke early to enjoy the sunrise in peace. Unfortunately, the family had beat him to the beach because they were having their portrait made. The children shrieked and ran wild. Doug and Courtney yelled at the kids to settle down. How unfortunate that right as they were set for the perfect photo, an unusually large wave crashed to shore. It knocked the group in their matching white button ups and khaki shorts to the ground. The children sobbed as they returned to their room with their soaked and defeated parents.\n        At dinner, an inebriated Doug saw a resemblance between Poseidon and a statue honoring him in the dining hall. \u201cHey, Barnacle Beard!\u201d Doug repeated all night. Poseidon showed great restraint when he manifested the slightest tremor. It knocked Doug unsteady, and he fell face-first into the dessert cart.  \n        \u201cI can\u2019t do another five days, Amphitrite. I just can\u2019t,\u201d Poseidon said as he threw his Hawaiian shirts and flip-flops in his suitcase.\n        \u201cSure you can. It\u2019s a big resort. We can avoid them. Besides, it\u2019s nonrefundable. We\u2019re staying,\u201d said Amphitrite. \n        The next morning, Poseidon stepped on the balcony with his coffee. Of course, Doug managed to ruin his day before it even began. Amphitrite joined Poseidon as they watched his archenemy in disgust. Doug found an innocent sea turtle to harass. With selfie-stick in hand, he posed with the giant reptile as it snapped and tried to retreat. Doug grew bored. He slurped the last of his iced coffee and flung the cup, plastic straw and all, into the ocean.  \n        \u201cBring me my trident!\u201d Poseidon boomed. \n        Amphitrite nodded. She knew what must be done. \n        Poseidon raised his trident in the air and let out a menacing bellow. Dark clouds filled the skies and the ocean swirled. Massive waves crashed against the shore. Lightning struck the sea and a rumble of thunder rattled the window. Poseidon slammed his trident against the floor with all his built-up rage. The earth quaked. The unfortunate souls out early to enjoy a beautiful day ran for cover. Hail stones pelted Doug. He dropped his phone in the surf as he hastened to escape the wrath of the storm. \n        The storm raged for five days. Poseidon lounged on the beach, sipping his margarita. He felt the thick raindrops on his face and the violent wind tousling his beard. The sounds of the thunderclaps lulled him into a healing meditation. It was the greatest vacation of his life.\n"}

Every day felt like one tornado after another, Diamond continued her normal routine of switching one mask for another. Today, Diamond played the role of an innocent college student trying to make it through school. In all honesty, this was truly one of her roles in life but not the one that was most central. \n        \u201cDiamond, where do you think you are going, looking like that? Change your image, we wouldn\u2019t want anyone to know who you are and what you are.\u201d Joyce said as Diamond was about to leave for school. Joyce was Diamond\u2019s guardian, when Diamond's parents died she was given to a guardian to be watched over. \n        \u201cSorry, Joyce, I almost forgot about that, let me adjust myself. There, that\u2019s better. How do I look?\u201d Diamond said with a snarky attitude. She had grown tired of hiding her true self, but she knew for the sake of her safety and her future she had to. This is why she always felt like her life was one big tornado, because she could never get to know anyone, and they never stayed in one place too long. \n        Joyce looked at Diamond and said, \u201cThat will do just fine but can you tone down the hair color a bit. You look like a big bright flamingo with that bright pink hair.\u201d Diamond proceeded to do as she was told and changed her hair color to a mundane brown, in order to not be called out again by Joyce before she can get out the door. \u201cRemember we will be leaving for a new place tomorrow, so be home early.\u201d \n        \u201cDo we have to move again? It\u2019s like every time we get settled we have to pack up and leave again. I\u2019m so tired of this. When can we stop running and hiding?\u201d Diamond made this complaint every six months when they moved. Luckily, they moved in between semesters so that it didn\u2019t interfere with her studies.\n        \u201cYou know we can\u2019t stay anywhere too long, my dear. They could still be searching for us. I made a promise to your parents before they died that I would keep you safe.\u201d Joyce knew this was a rough way of living for Diamond, but they had no choice. Before Diamond\u2019s parents died they lived in an isolated kingdom where they didn\u2019t have to hide. This was a time before the world grew violent and enemies penetrated their kingdom from all sides. Those who survived this hostile takeover left and went into hiding but most didn\u2019t survive. They had been on the move for almost eight years now, after crossing the planes into another world, and for those years they never stayed in one place twice or for too long. \n        Diamond walked out into the world not her own, this was the only time she truly felt free but lonely at the same time. No one knew who she was; they wouldn\u2019t even be able to describe her. Every week she changed the way she looked, only staying consistent when she had to deal with her professors face to face. This was rare since she never took any small classes where she could be easily recognizable. But this week would prove to be one of those weeks when she wanted to keep her look longer and play with fire. Walking down the street was Jonathan, who was in one of her classes at the university. He happened to be sitting next to her when he introduced himself for the first time. She tried to avoid him because she was nervous about talking to him, and she also didn\u2019t want to get attached, especially since they would be leaving soon. \n        Once she got on campus she changed her look to the one she had last week so that she can be easily recognizable by Jonathan. And as usual Jonathan noticed her and waved at her, and she waved back. In the lecture hall she picked a seat near the back, as a way to ensure a quick exit if needed. Seated comfortably she took out her notebook, then Jonathan came in and purposefully sat in the seat next to her. There were so many other seats available in the lecture hall, the fact that he picked that one was astonishing. Gathering the courage, Diamond cleared her throat and said, \u201cHello Jonathan, of all the seats in this place, you pick this one. How are you today?\u201d\n        \u201cHi Diamond, well, yes there are plenty of vacant seats but for some reason I always seem to be drawn to the seat that is next to you.\u201d Jonathan said so smoothly as he settled in his seat and looked over at Diamond with a grin on his face. Jonathan was a looker, tall with a not too buff, not too lean build with skin the color of terra-cotta pottery that made you think of fall. His smile was just magnetic, and those brown eyes were like pools of milk chocolate. It amazed Diamond that Jonathan was fascinated with her chosen look of an ordinary girl with short hair and brown skin. She purposefully made herself a little thicker than the average girl as a way to be overlooked for the more petite girls, but she guessed Jonathan was not interested in the stereotypical perfect girl. \n        Gathering her thoughts and courage once more she said in return, \u201cWell, I do appreciate the company especially in this class. It\u2019s always hard to focus on what the professor is trying to say. It\u2019s almost like the information just flies over your head.\u201d In all honesty Diamond knew why the information didn\u2019t stick in this class unlike other classes. It was because of her attraction to Jonathan and his closeness was the biggest distraction ever. \n        \u201cHow about we skip this class then and do some self studying then? I would love to get your opinion on the assignment due next week.\u201d Jonathan said, looking intently at Diamond waiting patiently for her to melt and say yes. \n        This was another one of those moments where Diamond almost forgot herself and let her image revert back to her natural image, which was so far removed from those around her. She had to concentrate extra hard this time just to keep up the act. She knew she should have politely declined, but her mind and mouth were not on the same page when she said, \u201cSure, why not.\u201d They got up to leave and headed for the library to get started on their self study session. \n        In the library they picked a small little nook in the back. Diamond sat and pulled out her books to do just as they said they would do, but Jonathan decided to sit right next to her instead of across from her. \u201cDiamond, ever since you came to this university five months ago, I\u2019ve been drawn to you. Even when we were in different sections, I switched to the one you were in.\u201d \n        Diamond was panicking internally as Joyce\u2019s words rang in her head, \u201cNever get close to anyone, we don\u2019t know if they are the enemy or not. It is better to be safe than sorry.\u201d Is this what she was talking about? Diamond tried to calm herself so that she wouldn\u2019t accidentally let her guard down and let go of focus on her chosen image. In that moment of panic and worry her image flickered to her original and true self. Jonathan blinked in surprise and then smiled, then the unexpected happened, his image changed as well.  \n        \u201cDiamond, you can reveal your true self now, I am one of the survivors from our lost kingdom.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s true image was pretty much the same as his chosen image, except he now had whiskers and fur, but his fur was still that terra-cotta colored loveliness and those eyes were still their pools of chocolateness. Diamond revealed herself, finally someone she didn\u2019t have to hide from. Even though she had dumbed down a lot of her features in order to not draw attention to herself, she was beautiful. She was a lot rounder and her fur was the color of sunset and the brightest amber eyes. \n        As comfortable as they were in their true image they both changed back to their chosen images. Instead of studying they continued to talk about their lives and how they both lived similar lives always on the move. Diamond decided to take a chance and invite Jonathan back to her place to meet Joyce in hopes that maybe, just maybe they could all stay here or at least move to the same place once it was time to leave. \u201cJonathan, I don\u2019t want to lose the first friend I\u2019ve had in years, you have to come and see my guardian. We have to convince her that we don\u2019t have to run anymore.\u201d \n        Later on, Diamond arrived home, she called out to Joyce, \u201cJoyce, are you here? We need to talk.\u201d Joyce came out of the back room and looked up in astonishment when she saw Jonathan.\n        \u201cDiamond, what has gotten into you? You know you are not supposed to bring anyone here.\u201d Before Joyce could finish her statement, Diamond dropped her mask and so did Jonathan. She was about to become furious before she took a second look at Jonathan and bowed. \u201cPrince Jonathanial, you survived. I thought you had perished on that unforgettable night. Diamond, meet the prince of our fallen kingdom, your betrothed.\u201d\n        Diamond was even more shocked, confused, surprised, and every other random emotion you could think of. \u201cWait a minute, you are a prince, and I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e? Here comes that tornado feeling again. What does this mean Joyce?\u201d\n        Joyce looked between the two, Diamond was looking at her expectantly while Jonathanial looked on calmly, then she began to explain the details of Diamond\u2019s life. \u201cDiamondala is your true name, you were born into a high ranking family under the royal family. Your parents were selected to produce a female heir to become the wife to the prince. But then the kingdom was attacked and destroyed, everyone thought everyone in the royal family had perished, but now you see that is not so. This means that my guardianship duties are over, you will now go with Jonathanial to be his wife. The time you have been waiting for my child has come where you can finally have someone other than me to get close to.\u201d \n        Diamondala looked at Joyce, if that was her actual name, with pure joy and happiness. But a part of her still felt sad, she wondered what was truly next. \u201cJoyce, what about you? Where will you go? I can\u2019t see my life without you in it.\u201d \n        \u201cMy child, I will always be with you. Just because I said my guardianship is over doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m leaving you completely. Also, my true name is Joycelyna. We will go wherever the prince takes us.\u201d \n        Diamondala looked at Jonathanial, and he responded to her unasked question. \u201cWe will stay here until the semester is over, but then we must move on. My plan is to find more of our people and to rebuild our kingdom. The threat has passed, but we still need to be vigilant as we rebuild. It is said that those who invaded our world were wiped out by disease, we still can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d \n        As time went on, they continued to move from place to place every six months. The moves were more bearable with each place they touched down in, they found more of their people who had survived. Eventually they had finally stopped moving and settled in a far off place where they rebuilt their kingdom and could now live in peace in their true image. The tornado of life had finally come to an end, and they could finally enjoy life in the open without hiding. \n\n"}

She felt a subtle tingle on her scalp and a refreshing coolness all over her body. \n        For years, she labored over her thick, wavy, chestnut hair. She\u2019d spent thousands of dollars on gels, conditioners, serums, volumizers, and so many other products. She had a whole drawer under her sink full of hair ties, curling irons, driers, and pins. Pulling the full drawer out of its cabinet, she walked out of the bathroom and down the hall to her kitchen garbage. She threw all the contents into a trash bag.\n        Her mother had always told Eli that her hair was her best quality. It was the first thing people noticed about her. When Abigail, her little 5-year-old niece, drew pictures of her, she depicted a tiny stick figure fully surrounded by brown swirls. For the first 30 years of her life, Eli had never cut her hair above her shoulders. She\u2019d gotten into the habit of pulling her long locks over her face when she was feeling insecure and twirling strands around her fingers when she needed to think.\n        \u201cOkay. Time to face the music,\u201d she said out loud to herself as she grabbed her car keys and headed out the door.\n        Before backing out of the driveway, she looked at herself one more time in the rearview mirror. She smiled at her unfamiliar reflection, taking in the contours of her skull and studying the shape of her face. It was an intensely intimate moment. She felt light, alert, and somehow more alive than she could ever remember.  \n        When she pulled up to her childhood home, she noticed that her sister\u2019s car was already in the driveway. She took a deep breath. She grabbed the plate of cookies she had baked for the party and rang the doorbell.\n        Abigail, dressed in a princess costume, came barreling through the door. As soon as the little girl registered Eli\u2019s face, she gasped. \u201cAuntie E! You\u2019re bald,\u201d she declared.\n        \u201cWhat are you talking about, sweetie?\u201d Eli heard her mom ask from the other room.\n        Abigail grabbed Eli\u2019s hand and led her into the overcrowded kitchen. Eli\u2019s parents, sister, brother-in-law, cousin, and aunt all sat around the table. Her mom was fussing over a pot of sauce on the stove while drinking a glass of wine. Her father and brother-in-law were in the middle of some kind of debate about stock options.\n        \u201cAuntie E is bald,\u201d Abigail calmly stated again.\n        Everyone turned to look at Eli in the doorway, and a hush fell over the busy room. Her mom dropped her glass of wine. It spilled all over the linoleum floor.\n        \u201cHere, let me get that,\u201d Eli said, grabbing a towel. At the same moment, her mom ducked down to dab at the spill, and the two bumped heads.\n        \u201cOuch!\u201d both said at the same time, reaching to touch their foreheads. They looked at each other and began to laugh.\n        \u201cYour beautiful hair!\u201d Eli\u2019s mom said. She was still laughing, but tears were gathering in the corners of her eyes. \n        \u201cI know mom. What do you think?\u201d Eli said, rubbing the red spot where she had collided with her mom.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d her mom said.\n        Abigail was at Eli\u2019s side again and began rubbing the top of her head. \u201cIt is so soft. You feel like a duckling,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cYou look like a rock star,\u201d said her sister.\n        \u201cCan I feel?\u201d asked her aunt, bending down to rub Eli\u2019s head.\n        \u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d her mom asked as she grabbed another towel.\n        \u201cI needed a change,\u201d Eli said. \n        \u201cWhat did your boss say?\u201d her dad asked.\n        \u201cI quit last week,\u201d Eli said, registering his look of shock.\n        \u201cWhat does Uncle Joey think about your haircut?\u201d Abigail asked.\n        There was a long pause. Eli\u2019s parents made eye contact, and her aunt squeezed her hand.\n        \u201cUncle Joey doesn\u2019t like it, sweetie, but that doesn\u2019t really matter. I like it,\u201d Eli said, looking into her niece's eyes. Abigail looked up at her with a big smile.\n        There was a lot more Eli needed to say. Eventually, she would have to tell her family about dropping out of her residency program. She\u2019d need to rehash the details of her sudden and dramatic breakup with Joe. She\u2019d have to cry with her mom as she explained the details of her plans to take a full year away from the family to travel.\n        But first, there was wine to be cleaned, sauce to be seasoned, and a meal to eat. Looking around that bright little kitchen at the surprised faces of her family, Eli knew that it would take them a long time to understand the choices she was making. Yet, she also knew that, no matter what, there would still be a seat for her at the table.\n"}

Mondays were the worst; after a weekend with nobody expecting him to look a certain way, he had to adhere to a painfully strict dress code. Never mind that he still wasn\u2019t sure yet on pronouns for today. At least half of his coworkers in HR had joked that the dress code had been written on clay tablets, except the Sumerians wouldn\u2019t have demanded women wear pantyhose, low to mid-height heels, and a skirt that fell below the knee. Not that Michael could have gotten away with any of that. His boss\u2019 boss would have had an absolute conniption. The man was very rigid in his thinking and his assumptions about the world and how it worked, no matter how many \u201cdiversity trainings\u201d he\u2019d gone through.\n        Michael had gone \u201cstealth\u201d a few times, either wearing something under his clothing that wouldn\u2019t get noticed, or pants that he\u2019d picked up in a store that catered to women. But he only did that on the days when the pointer on his personal gender map slid solidly into the \u201cI\u2019m feeling female today\u201d area. \n        Unfortunately, today seemed like it was one of those days. Sighing, Michael grabbed a pair of pantyhose and dress socks from his dresser drawer. He debated for a moment, then pulled the \u201cwomen\u2019s pants\u201d off their hanger. Really, they were so generic it was pretty much impossible to tell they weren\u2019t sold as men\u2019s business casual clothing. But the shirt was going to be the worst, he could tell. None of his \u201cmen\u2019s shirts\u201d seemed right. And all the blouses he had were going to be too obvious.\n        Michael swore, grabbed the men\u2019s dress shirt that was the softest he owned, and put it on with reluctance. He\u2019d get looks and comments, but those were usually polite or lightly teasing, and came from people assuming his sexual orientation rather than his gender identity. He tried to convince himself that it would be okay, that he\u2019d get through the day, and come home and change into clothes that better fit how he was feeling. Which lasted until he remembered that today, of all Mondays, was the Human Resources all-hands meeting, where Charles, his boss\u2019 boss, the bane of his \u2013 and to be fair, almost everyone else in HR\u2019s \u2013 existence, was going to be giving another presentation on diversity in the workplace.\n        Charles wouldn\u2019t know diversity if he was swimming in it, Michael thought morosely. The all-hands meant a tie. And even with the perfect tie for his shirt, it didn\u2019t really matter, because today was turning out to be a Michaela day, where every single element of her identity (only now did the pronouns settle for her) pointed to \u201cwoman.\u201d\n        Michaela wanted to ask whatever part of herself that decided on these things why today had to be a female day, but it wasn\u2019t like she could externalize any of it. And calling out sick wasn\u2019t an option on an all-hands day. She\u2019d have to wing it as best she could.\n        Michaela pulled on her clothes, tied the tie as loosely as she could get away with, and shrugged on the suit jacket: another purchase from that women\u2019s store, and just as generic. Then her wallet and keys went into the appropriate pockets. She steadfastly refused to look in a mirror on her way out the door; that\u2019d have her in tears, and she really wasn\u2019t up for that on top of everything else.\n        The drive into work wasn\u2019t horrible, but she spent the majority of it bracing herself for being misgendered and misidentified for the day. It\u2019s a good job for now, she thought to herself, and except for Charles, it\u2019s mostly a healthy place to work. Mostly. The internal pep talk worked, enough, and by the time she walked into the HR space, she felt as braced for the day as she was likely to be.\n        Kathy, \u201cMichael\u2019s\u201d manager, was a total ray of sunshine. \u201cI got you your favorite from the kiosk downstairs,\u201d she chirped at Michaela sweetly, \u201cbecause I know how much you love Charles\u2019 presentations.\u201d Her sunny yellow blouse went perfectly with her darker brown skin, and Michaela envied Kathy for a moment; at least Kathy could wear what was comfortable for her. Even though she\u2019d confided once to \u201cMichael\u201d that she thought the pantyhose requirement was far too backwards for a supposedly progressive business like theirs.\n        Michaela, far too aware of her voice, said \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Kathy, thank you.\u201d She picked up the coffee (iced, two pumps caramel, two vanilla, a splash of whole milk), and sipped. The all-hands wasn\u2019t until ten o\u2019clock, so she at least had time to get caffeinated, answer emails, and prepare for the rest of the week.\n        Michaela made sure to get to the conference room early enough to get a seat in the back, in a corner next to the window where she\u2019d only have people on her left and in front of her. She was not up for dealing with even politely intended conversation, and figured the corner would keep interactions to a minimum. That didn\u2019t stop Kathy from plopping down next to her and telling her all the latest gossip from around the office, but Michaela didn\u2019t mind. Kathy gossiping was about the most harmless possible option, especially as her gossip was mostly about who was watching which reality show that week.\n        But in the midst of it, Kathy paused, and said quietly to Michaela, \u201cI hear Charles has a really, really important announcement. I don\u2019t know what it is, nobody seems to, so I don\u2019t know if you need to be braced for anything. You\u2019re good at your job, so even if it\u2019s layoffs, I\u2019ll protect you. But, you know, be ready.\u201d\n        Michaela managed a thank you just as Charles\u2019 boss moved to the podium at the front of the room. Stuart was the head of Human Resources, a good man to everyone in the department, and probably more comfortable with diversity than almost anyone else in management. He\u2019d been the one pushing diversity initiatives, even when Charles dug his heels in and wouldn\u2019t do more than the bare minimum for his division.\n        The first fifteen minutes were spent on presentations about new hires, promotions, positive outcomes, and upcoming challenges. Stuart made things interesting, even though Michaela had been in the job long enough that most of this all-hands sounded just like the past several this year.\n        But then Stuart paused. He signaled for the slideshow to be turned off, and shifted to a more serious tone. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sure some of you have heard that Charles has an announcement. I want to make it clear up front that this has nothing to do with your jobs. Corporate has been very satisfied with our performance so far this year, and while I can\u2019t guarantee bonuses, I can say with absolute confidence you don\u2019t need to worry about employment for the foreseeable future.\u201d \n        Michaela practically felt the wave of relief from around the conference room. \n        Stuart continued, \u201cThis is a bit more, hm, delicate. I\u2019d like all of you to wait to comment until after Charles\u2019 statement, there will be curated break-out sessions afterward for people with questions, but please remember to be respectful.\u201d\n        Is Charles quitting? Michaela couldn\u2019t see it; he\u2019d been with the company for decades now, but he wasn\u2019t that close to retirement.\n        Even though everyone in the room had quieted, Michaela still felt an expectant hum from everyone there.\n        Then she felt her jaw sag open as Charles stepped into the room in a skirt, blouse, and flats. If somebody had dropped a pin in the carpeted conference room, Michaela thought she would have heard it.\n        As Charles went to the podium, it was clear to Michaela that he had been practicing moving in a skirt; she\u2019d done it often enough on the weekends when her gender shifted to female. Was \u201che\u201d even the right pronoun anymore, Michaela wondered.\n        \u201cHi,\u201d Charles began in a slightly higher pitched voice than usual. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about how to do this for a long time now, but it made sense to get this addressed in front of all of you.\u201d Charles paused, clearly working up to the next part. \u201cI\u2019m a trans woman, and I\u2019m going to ask you to call me Charlene, and use she and her pronouns for me.\u201d\n        Michaela felt faint. Of all the things that this could have been, Charlene coming out as a trans woman was so far down the list, Michaela hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility. Suddenly, a lot of Charlene\u2019s resistance to diversity issues, especially around gender identity, took on a whole new meaning.\n        \u201cI know this is probably sudden for all of you,\u201d Charlene continued, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry about that. What I\u2019m more sorry about is how my resistance to my identity impacted everyone here, from an unkind dress code to my resistance to diversity and inclusion. I\u2019m working on being better about that, and Stuart and I have drafted a far more comfortable dress code, among other policy changes intended to support all of you.\u201d\n        When it was clear that Charlene was done, Kathy stood up, grinned at her boss, and said in a clear and carrying voice, \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you, Charlene.\u201d As though her comment had been permission, everyone in the room stood up over the next several minutes, and told Charlene it was good to meet her. This led to Charlene bursting into tears at one point, with Stuart awkwardly offering tissues, while the wave of heartfelt support just kept going.\n        Only Michaela hadn\u2019t stood up; she was waiting for the right moment. Everyone else was supportive, but so much of her upset and frustration was tied into Charlene and how she\u2019d behaved since Michaela had gotten the job. Only now, that frustration was melting away, slowly replaced with giddy relief.\n        When everyone else was done, she stood, looked directly at Charlene, and said, \u201cI see you, Charlene, as you are.\u201d And watched Charlene\u2019s face register surprise and shock, followed by a quick nod of acknowledgement.\n        For the next several minutes, while Stuart was organizing the break-out sessions, Michaela let herself float in the moment. More than a few people had looked at her with curiosity, since what she\u2019d said was different from everyone else. But she knew that for a lot of trans folk, it felt correct to be seen and acknowledged for who you were. It lasted even through Kathy pulling Michaela aside for a one-on-one in a small meeting room.\n        \u201cSo,\u201d Kathy said quietly, \u201cno pressure or anything, but\u2026 my door is always open if you need to talk about anything.\u201d\n        Michaela hesitantly started, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take anything away from Charlene. That took, I don\u2019t know, some serious bravery to come out in front of everyone like that.\u201d\n        Kathy nodded.\n        \u201cI\u2019m genderfluid, Kathy. I figured it out a couple of years ago, but the policy here was so strict, I didn\u2019t even want to bring it up with you.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the policy\u2019s going to be a lot more relaxed. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got your back, we\u2019ll get everything sorted for you.\u201d She looked at Michaela, and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m your boss, but oh honey I\u2019m going to offer fashion tips too. It\u2019s a good look, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it does kind of scream how uncomfortable you are.\u201d\n        \u201cI wish I could take time to go home and change,\u201d Michaela started, only for Kathy to hold up a hand. \n        \u201cGo. Extended lunch, you don\u2019t need to clock out, just come back comfortable and ready to work. And what name should I be using?\u201d\n        \u201cMichael on the days when I\u2019m dressed more like a man, Michaela on the days when I\u2019m dressed more feminine.\u201d\n        \u201cGot it. Don\u2019t worry about the paperwork, we\u2019ll make everything right for you. Michaela.\u201d Kathy grinned. \u201cNow, get going. We\u2019re going to have so much training to update, I think our schedule\u2019s just been kicked out a couple of months.\u201d\n        Michaela grinned back. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d"}

It is Thanksgiving weekend. The protagonist is a first-year college student who is nervous to reveal to his best high-school friend that he is gay. They haven't seen each other since the summer because they have gone to different colleges. They meet for coffee. The first-person narrator is worried that his friend won't accept the news and that it could jeopardize the friendship. However, the narrator learns that, in the few months since starting college, his friend has also had the opportunity to come out as gay. Both are relieved at each other's news and reveal that they both have potential love interests they've developed through campus activities. The opportunity to receive each other's news makes it clear that the friendship is in no danger and that they will remain friends for years.","targets":"        I sat at a table near the window and waited for Jim to show up. I\u2019d been away at my first semester in college, and we decided to get together to go Christmas shopping for our families. Jim went to State U a couple of hours\u2019 drive from here. I ended up at Wentzen, a small, four-year college on the East Coast, a three-hour flight away. We had messaged each other pretty regularly for the first week or two, but things got busy as a first-year college student, so the frequency really dropped off once we got past orientation and into our classes. Jim wanted to study engineering, so he took a heavy load of science and math in his first semester. I was just working on getting requirements out of the way before deciding, but I was leaning towards history.\n        Jim and I were inseparable in high school. We ran guys\u2019 track and played in the band together. We both played trombone and mostly ended up sitting next to each other because it was always neck and neck between us for the first-chair position. Ours was a friendly competition. I didn\u2019t really care if I won all the time, and neither did he. We had most of our classes together, too.\n        Not seeing each other every day was an adjustment at first, but I got used to it. They made it easy to make friends at Wentzen with orientation week, plus all kinds of organizations and activities. I didn\u2019t do band or sports in college, but I joined the newspaper. Since we hadn\u2019t really talked much in the past couple of months, I didn\u2019t know what Jim had gotten into at State. I had some pretty big news to tell him, but I didn\u2019t really know exactly how to work it into the conversation. Sometimes friends grow apart when they go away to school. I really hoped we hadn\u2019t. I started to get antsy as the clock above the register ticked away.\n        When Jim finally showed up, I stood to say \u201chi\u201d and gave him a quick pat on the back before we took our seats together.\n        \u201cSorry I\u2019m a few minutes late. Parking, you know?\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d We had decided to meet on the second-biggest shopping day of the year. Probably not ideal, but we both had to return to our respective campuses for finals the following week.  \n        \u201cI ordered already. I got you that cinnamon latte thing you like.\u201d\n        \u201cPerfect. Thanks.\u201d Jim looked nervous. He shifted in his seat.\n        \u201cBuddy, are you okay? It\u2019s no big deal that you\u2019re a little late\u201d\n        \u201cWhat? Oh. Uh, no. It\u2019s not that. I wanted to talk to you about something before we get going with the shopping.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah? What is it? Sounds serious.\u201d My heart speeded up a bit. Did he know already? Was he mad at me?\n        \u201cIt is\u2026 I guess, kinda.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSo I met somebody at school.\u201d\n        \u201cDude! That\u2019s great! What\u2019s her name? What\u2019s she like?\u201d\n        We had both done a little dating in high school. Very little in my case. I went to prom with my friend Amanda, but I suppose that counted. He\u2019d briefly gone out with Kaylee Austin our junior year. She was big in Student Council and fairly popular, so that ended up giving him a bit of a boost in his social status. Not that he needed it. The track trophies had already sealed that for him.\n        \u201cUmm. Well, uh. That\u2019s the thing I wanted to talk about.\u201d Jim looked grave.\n        \u201cWhat, is she terminal or something? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I began to wonder whether I should bother to get to my news after this.\n        \u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d He looked down at the table before going on. \u201cI\u2026 it\u2019s not a girl. His name is Del.\u201d\n        I swallowed hard. This was a bit of a shocker. \u201cUm, well, uh\u2026 does this mean you\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cYeah. If you\u2019re asking if this means I like guys, yeah, I do.\u201d He cast his eyes downward again.\n        I didn\u2019t know how to respond, so I sat there, trying to gather my thoughts. This was not where I thought this conversation was going at all.\n        He tried again. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I wasn\u2019t lying to you all this time. I just wasn\u2019t, you know, sure. Please don\u2019t be mad at me. I\u2026\u201d\n        I moved to stop him, but just then they called my name for the drinks.\n        \u201cHold that thought,\u201d I said as I got up to grab the coffee beverages.\n        Back at the table, I handed Jim his cinnamon latte and sat back down across from him. His face was red, I guessed with embarrassment or just intense emotions of some kind. He obviously needed some reassurance, so I looked him in the eye and let out a breath I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding.\n        \u201cDude, it\u2019s okay. I actually have some news I need to tell you, too.\u201d\n        \u201cOh, well, sorry to steal your thunder, then.\u201d He laughed. It sounded hopeful.\n        I took a breath and steadied myself. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one.\u201d\n        Jim raised an eyebrow. \u201cSorry, what? Not the only what?\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who likes guys. Me too. I\u2019m not going out with anybody, but yeah. I\u2019ve known for a while, too, but I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize our friendship.\u201d There. It was done. I said it. \u201cI like Nick, a guy I\u2019m working on the newspaper with, and we\u2019re talking a lot, but I haven\u2019t had the guts to tell him yet.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat? Are you kidding me?\u201d He looked like he was about to explode with joy. \u201cThat\u2019s great! What? No way!\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re so happy for me. That was a lot easier than I thought.\u201d\n        Jim burst out laughing. \u201cYeah, well, I'm happy I could make it so easy for you.\u201d His sarcasm had made a return, so I could tell he was relieved.\n        I laughed too. In fact, I couldn\u2019t stop for a while. Finally, I breathed out, \u201cWhy?... How did we never talk about this before?\u201d\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know, man. Cheers.\u201d He held his latte aloft and waited for me to tap his paper cup with mine."}

She was youthful and oh-so lovely with her sleek black hair and large innocent doe eyes fringed with long dark eyelashes. To Adam, she was an angel who descended to earth in a white satin wedding dress.  She had lilies in her hair that spilled out over a matching bouquet that was folded in her soft chestnut hands. Adam smiled at her with the gentle, measured smile that he always gave. \n        He had the perfect smile, and made sure it was impeccable. He would always flash just the right amount of teeth, and relax his brows. The touch that made his smile absolutely flawless was how Adam squinted his eyes just a little to make sure that the expression reached his whole face. His patience was beginning to wane. Watching his future wife\u2019s agonizingly slow wedding march angered him. He was so close to being able to actually relax and feel secure with his relationship. \n        Adam spent almost two years playing the role of the perfect partner, sucking up to her parents and making sure to always go above and beyond to pamper the silly young girl. He gave her whatever she wanted: jewelry, flowers for no reason, books signed by her favorite author, expensive and creative dates. He made sure that she was always happy. Now it was his turn. Adam was so close to locking her into a lifetime of submissiveness. All it would take are a few \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d and then - she would never abandon him. \n        He spent the wedding ceremony mapping out their life together. He\u2019d make sure that he had the perfect life: the house, the white picket fence, the dog, the five kids, and the perfect submissive housewife. Adam would hold everything together as the head of the family. It would be so easy for him to knock her up and guilt her into staying at home with the baby. \n        His last wife was just a bit too hard-headed and resistant, but this time, things would go perfectly. Adam also underestimated the depth of his ex\u2019s familial connections. It was a miscalculation that he would not make again. Their first kiss sealed her fate, she was all his until the day she died. \n        He spent the wedding reception thanking his lucky stars that he found the perfect woman. Adam chose Nimkii carefully. She was a beautiful, young Anishinaabe woman in her early twenties, with hardly any friends and no previous dating experience. She was never particularly close to her parents. He rejoiced in the fact that he was Nimkii\u2019s only support system. Not only was she beautiful, she was modest. Adam loved that no other man would look at her, despite her striking beauty. Nimkii often wore long pants and floor length skirts and dresses. \n        He watched her as she danced in the middle of a group. It was the most outgoing he had ever seen her. His new wife was normally quite conservative, small, and easily swayed. She was clay in Adam\u2019s hands, like the perfect medium. She gave no resistance to him. He knew he could easily mold her. Something about the way she danced made him feel deeply unsettled. She looked graceful, powerful, and bold. It was a side that he had never seen of her before.\n        Nimkii quickly stopped, and she was back to her regular docile self. Adam just shook his head and chalked it up to her getting swept up in the moment. The rest of the reception was fine, it didn\u2019t particularly matter to him. Adam was over the moon to be able to let his mask slip as soon as they were away from the prying eyes of their guests. \n        This would be the beginning of his perfect life. Moving forward, he would hold all the cards in the marriage. She would be his sweet little wifey, and nothing else. He\u2019d make sure her only ambitions would be to make him happy. \n        Adam grinned in earnest for the first time as he closed the door to their honeymoon suite behind his new wife. He plopped down on the bed, throwing his suit jacket on the floor and loosening his tie. He kicked back on the bed while Nimkii wandered around the suite. \n        \u201cWow! This bathroom is huge! I don\u2019t even want to know how much we spent on this!\u201d \n        Adam chucked to himself and responded, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry about stuff like that anymore. I\u2019ll be controlling our finances from here on out. You know\u2026 I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d \n        There was a moment of silence from the bathroom. He just continued. \u201cHow about you come in here and help me take off my shoes?\u201d \n        Her sweet voice responded from the bathroom door. \u201cOf course, dear! That sounds like a great idea. My feet are killing me from dancing in these high heels.\u201d\n        He closed his eyes, content with his situation, and waited for Nimkii to come out. The delicate clicks of her heels on the title floor stopped as she opened the door to the bathroom and started to walk quietly on the carpet. \n        Adam watched her eagerly as she started toward him. Her long satin dress pooled on the floor around her feet, and with each step her smile grew wider and wider in anticipation. Adam smirked. He relished in her beauty and the way that her hips moved when she walked towards him. He was transfixed, watching the outline of her svelte legs through the form-fitting wedding dress. With each step closer, the satin bunched up just a little bit around Nimkii\u2019s feet, until Adam noticed a glimmer of something dark and lacquered. \n        \u201cHey, I thought you said you took your shoes off.\u201d \n        \u201cOh yeah, I couldn\u2019t stand to be in those things a moment longer. See?\u201d Nimkii lifted her dress slightly to show off her feet and ankles. Where her feet should have been there were a pair of cloven hooves, and her ankles were hairy and tawny like those of a doe. Adam felt a bolt of panic shoot straight through his body, and he scrambled to sit upright again. He managed to sputter out.\n        \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d \n        \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I thought we were both getting comfortable now that we\u2019re married.\u201d Nimkii cut him off with a cold voice. Her once-innocent eyes were wide, wild and dark like two bottomless pits. She grinned at her new husband with a gentle, measured, perfect smile."}

Writing is an expression of themselves, and of the person they cannot be to the world. On paper, they reveal themselves. So many people, so many hours writing away. How much is always hidden? I\u2019m sure, dear reader, you would like to know who they are, wouldn\u2019t you? That is the interesting point. If you met them out in the world, would you feel the same?\n        It is just Meryl who picks up their pen and writes. That is, if their dog hasn\u2019t run away with the pen. Sometimes Meryl loses their pen. Yes, they usually type on a computer, but they still need to map their ideas out on a pad of paper. Sometimes, it is nice to have a connection to the world where pen meets paper. \n        Meryl picks up their pen and writes because they have to. Sometimes, they don't know what else they would do. How else would they fill the hours? Who would they be without writing? A friend to their dog? A friend to their friends? The one who is always there to help? The one who remains silent about themself? \n        Interestingly enough, most people want Meryl\u2019s help. Yet, they don't want to be with the real Meryl. They require them to hide themselves. So, when Meryl is with them, their family or acquaintances, they have learned to speak differently and pretend they don't read what they do, and that they don't think about the things they care about. To keep other people happy, they manage to do things without actually doing them. For instance, Meryl cooks without cooking, so the \"chefs\" in their family don't feel challenged. \n        Should Meryl do or say anything of import, people would get upset. Hence, their best friend is their dog. Their dog is happy with them and loves when they read. Cuddle time! In front of their dog, Meryl can be themself. They can say what they mean, and not worry that people will say things like: \u201cOh, you think you are so smart because you went to college,\u201d or \u201cYou think because you read all those books you are better than us, well you have no common sense,\u201d or more recently \u201cYes, but I can run a household, budget, and shop.\u201d\n        Really, I wonder how they think it was possible for Meryl to survive all these years without being able to budget for themselves, and grocery shop. I also wonder what common sense Meryl is lacking. Perhaps, common sense is just a term to catch those choices of Meryl\u2019s that don\u2019t mesh with theirs? Thus, Meryl is trained by experience not to let their guard down. Not ever. It does not go well. \n        They did it once though, gloriously for themself. While defending their dissertation, the initial defense was finished and they, along with the other graduate students who attended these events, waited outside the examination room. Meryl\u2019s friends tried to encourage her by telling her the defense was brilliant and assured her that soon they would come out to tell her that she has passed. {1}\n        This is common practice amongst graduated students. They all attend other defenses, not just to learn from the experience, but to support the defender. The process is brutal. \n        Moments later, Meryl was called back in. It\u2019s not unusual for the committee to sometimes call the defender back into the room alone for clarification on various points. The committee said they would allow Meryl to pass, but they wanted one phrase removed from the work, \u201csilence implies consent.\u201d {1}\n        Meryl had already stipulated in the introduction that people can be silent on important topics for many reasons, but that does not change the fact that they may be morally culpable for said silence. The committee didn\u2019t think this was enough. {1}\n        Meryl heard themself say, as through a long tunnel, \u201cHaving spoken to many survivors, and read many testimonies, it would be an egregious ethical failure to negate the impact that silence has had on the lives of the victims.\u201d {1}\n        They were sent back out of the room, and everyone outside wanted to know what happened. Meryl\u2019s throat closed and tears welled up in their eyes. The tears started to fall. The other students, and their friends, were incredulous when they heard what had just happened. The unified response was, \u201cAll you had to do was agree with them to pass, you have worked on this for years!\u201d {1}\n        Newsflash, Meryl knew this better than anyone at the moment. The work of Meryl's lifetime seemed to be spiraling away into the abyss. \n        Amongst the chaos of exclamations from their friends and random graduate students, Meryl begins to hear the song they played on repeat that morning to help relieve the anxiety. {2} It was Whitney Houston\u2019s One Moment in Time. \n        The chorus, \u201cGive me one moment in time when I\u2019m more than I thought I could be, when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away and the answers are all up to me,\u201d played in their head. This was their moment. They took it, and would deal with the consequences. It was not enough to pass. They needed to pass as themself, for what they believed in. This was their moment in time.  \n        Meryl was called back into the room. They walked in and sat down. Meryl felt as if she was on a listing boat. The room was shifting under their feet. The committee looked at them in silence. \n        Finally, their mentor said, \u201cWe have agreed that if you put the same citation that you did in your introduction next to each instance you use the phrase, that will be fine. Congratulations, Doctor!\u201d\n        In a perfect world, Meryl would always be as they were in that one moment of time. Alas, life does not work that way, and thus sometimes, they pretend to be less than they are to get along with people who judge them for being themselves. It is not because they are an actual threat to others, but because others cannot accept that it is alright for someone to choose a different life path than the one they have. Even in those hurtful moments, Meryl hears the echoes of the song giving them strength: \u201cThen in that one moment of time, I will be, I will be, I will be free!\u201d "}

He let out a loud yawn, then looked back, trying to see how many inches Tortoise had crept forward. To his surprise, Tortoise was not there at all. Hare blinked, considered the impossible, then turned his gaze to the portion of the track still ahead of him.\n        Surrounded by cheering friends was Tortoise, standing well past the finish line with a smug grin on his face. At the very least, Hare assumed it was smug\u2014really, Tortoise was just smiling with the same droopy, amphibious face he always had.\n        Gawking, Hare sprang to his feet, hopping over the scant half-foot of track he hadn\u2019t crossed before napping. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d He called out, fuzzy brown brow furrowed. \u201cDid you cheat? Did someone carry you?\u201d\n        Tortoise began to open his mouth. Hare stood up on his hind legs, scowling, waiting for his rival to speak. A leaf, bleached yellow by the encroaching tides of fall, swished through the air, back and forth, until touching the ground.\n        \u201cNo,\u201d Tortoise said.\n        \u201cThen what happened?\u201d Hare snapped. \u201cHow\u2019d you win? I was only asleep for ten minutes!\u201d\n        Tortoise was still in the process of closing his mouth after his last word. Hare began tapping his foot on the ground impatiently.\n        A voice from the crowd spoke out, \u201cYou were asleep for several hours, Hare.\u201d \n        Hare looked over to see Squirrel fidgeting and repeatedly rotating an acorn in his hands.\n        \u201cI mean, you were out like a light,\u201d Squirrel said. \u201cTortoise only made it past the finish line a few minutes ago, to be honest.\u201d\n        Flabbergasted, Hare started sputtering like a canister of fireworks emitting sparks. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s absurd! I didn\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t\u2014I would never\u2014! Sleep? I don\u2019t even sleep! Ever!\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Squirrel said. \u201cYou sleep like the rest of us.\u201d\n        \u201cA lot, apparently,\u201d Fox agreed, standing at the back of the audience. \u201cShould probably be more cautious.\u201d\n        \u201cGood\u2026 game,\u201d Tortoise enunciated.\n        Hare turned back to look at Tortoise, utterly aghast. \u201cI\u2026 This\u2026\u201d He huffed, stamping both feet on the ground. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d He shrieked before turning tail and running away.\n\n        To some degree, Hare wished he could say that he could never go outside again, that he was the laughingstock of the forest, and even showing his face outside the cover of bush or grass would have him be mocked relentlessly for losing a race to Tortoise. In reality, however, no one even seemed to care. There had been a few jokes for a day or two, but then the rest of the forest lost interest. It was yesterday\u2019s news, a yesterday that Hare was still living..\n        Ever since he was a kit, he\u2019d always been the fastest. He had challenged every single animal in the forest to a race, and he\u2019d won every single one. He\u2019d left Squirrel in the dust, sprinted out ahead of Deer, and absolutely escaped Fox that one time she tried to eat him. But to not just lose, but lose to Tortoise of all animals, was the worst insult Hare could imagine.\n        He couldn\u2019t eat, sleep, or think about anything other than beating Tortoise. Everyone thought he was the fastest, and he had to keep that image no matter what. That was who he was, and who he had to be. \n        It couldn\u2019t just be a normal victory, either; he had to win so thoroughly and completely that there was never any doubt again that he was the fastest. Would he run one hundred laps while Tortoise ran one? He could compete using just one leg, or maybe blindfolded.\n        Hare continued brainstorming ideas as he trained his body, hopping in place for hours on end with a wild look in his eyes.\n\n        The next day, bereft of food and sleep and much of his sanity, Hare approached Tortoise, hopping agitatedly. \u201cTortoise!\u201d He snarled out. \n        Tortoise, a smile on his face, began to open his mouth.\n        Hare bounced in front of the reptile, awaiting a response.\n        \u201cHello,\u201d Tortoise said.\n        \u201cI demand a rematch!\u201d Hare declared. \u201cYou only won last time by a fluke! I\u2019ll beat you this time!\u201d\n        Tortoise began to open his mouth for a response, but Hare just continued talking.\n        \u201cI\u2019m faster than you, and we both know it!\u201d Hare started hopping circles around Tortoise, glaring daggers into his shell. \u201cI\u2019m faster than everyone! Everyone in the whole forest! No one beats me in a race!\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2026 know,\u201d Tortoise stated.\n        \u201cKnow what?\u201d Hare snapped.\n        The sound of a nearby babbling brook flowed between the two, filling the air where there was otherwise silence.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 faster,\u201d Tortoise said.\n        Hare just scowled, continuing to hop in place. His feet had not stayed on the ground for more than a second since he approached Tortoise. \u201cOf course I am! But you won! So what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n        It was early in the morning. The dew on the grass was fresh and clean. The sun shone through the forest roof like clean water trickling down tall rocks worn smooth by the current.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 okay,\u201d Tortoise said.\n        \u201cOkay to what?\u201d Hare growled.\n        The chilly wind of a new fall day wrapped frosted blankets of cold around the two creatures, embracing them with the internal warmth the cold weather brought. The grass bent, but didn\u2019t break beneath Hare\u2019s feet as the wind whistled patiently for Tortoise\u2019s response.\n        Tortoise smiled. \u201cTo\u2026 lose.\u201d\n        Hare stopped and stood.\n        \"No, it\u2019s not,\" he retorted immediately. He began walking in a circle around Tortoise, paws on his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay to lose. I can\u2019t lose because I\u2019m faster than you, and you\u2026 I mean, you know that, but, I mean, I still\u2026\u201d He stopped in front of Tortoise, looking him in the eyes. The reptile\u2019s expression was calm and serene as he stood completely still, unmoving in the wake of Hare\u2019s frantic rambling.\n        Hare huffed. He paced for another moment, and another still. He wrapped his arms around himself, wrapping the blanket of cold tighter.\n        \u201cMaybe\u2026 you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, resigned. He flopped over, leaning against Tortoise. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful being the fastest.\u201d He climbed up, lying down on the Tortoise\u2019s back. \u201cI always felt like I had to prove myself, but really\u2026 I just wanted to nap.\u201d\n        \u201cNap,\u201d Tortoise stated.\n        Hare nodded in agreement. \u201cNap.\u201d\n        The two animals closed their eyes and fell into a deep sleep.\n\n"}

While he and Dmitri had not been seeing each other for very long\u2014only a few months, in fact\u2014Mark had developed a deep love for the Russian scientist. But he also knew that he must confront Dmitri about his suspicions. A relationship could not be built without trust, and Mark\u2019s trust in Dmitri had begun to shake over the last few weeks. \n        Mark walked quickly across the pathway between buildings ten and eleven at the British Research Station on Deception Island, just north of the Antarctic Circle. The island, named after its seemingly safe harbor, was actually a horseshoe-shaped landmass whose center bay contained an active volcanic caldera. This oppositional combination of fire and ice had made the island a geological wonder. Black sand and glacial ice covered the landscape. Odd pools of steaming water, heated by volcanic activities, held rare and brightly colored algae only seen on this island. Colonies of chinstrap penguins squawked just north of the base, waddling across the frozen pyrotechnic flows that cut through the glaciers. \n        Deception Island sits in an archipelago known as the South Shetland Islands, just north of the Antarctic Peninsula. Discovered in 1821 by the Brits and not long afterward by the Russians, it quickly became a hub for whalers. By the early 1900s, the island was dotted with a cluster of whaling teams from multiple nations. These teams would drag the whales into the bay after killing them, tie them to the docks, and process the animals on the edge of the water. At the height of whaling in the region in the early part of the twentieth century, the bay docks were host to over three thousand rotting whale carcasses. This industry had died out by World War II, giving way to its new purpose, international research and US\/Soviet grandstanding.\n        Mark continued his walk down the salted pathway. The last time he and Dmitri took this walkway to the residence hall, Dmitri claimed that he could still smell a faint hint of decaying flesh on the island. Mark just laughed. Mark was a man of science and felt that sometimes Dmitri\u2019s Russian roots compelled him more towards superstitions than reality.\n        The British base of operations on the island was one of several. Argentina\u2019s base was only a few miles away, and the American base was just across the bay. The Soviet base where Dmitri stayed was a brisk fifteen-minute walk from Mark\u2019s residence. The collection of research stations on the island and the international assortment of scientists that dwelled at these stations created a sense of optimistic camaraderie. But the various teams of armed soldiers that sometimes milled around outside these stations reminded Mark that the year was 1966, and not all scientists, namely the Soviet Union\u2019s research team, were to be trusted.  \n        Even though it was the height of summer, which in Antarctica meant December, the temperature never got above thirty-six degrees Fahrenheit. Mark had arrived on the island with his research team from Oxford University in England at the tail end of winter in September. Stepping off of the British naval vessel and onto the docks, Mark felt a wind that cut through him, right into his bones. In winter, the temperature fell down to negative twenty degrees Fahrenheit. He was warned by the British sailors who transported the research team to the base to keep his hands and other extremities covered at all times when outside. Frostbite could develop in minutes, and tissue death could begin within an hour of exposure. Mark had told Dmitri that he had never in his life felt so cold as on that day when he first arrived.\n        Now that it was summer, life was a little more bearable in terms of temperature, though no one went outside without full protective gear. Mark was even getting used to the hazy, eternal sun that never quite dipped below the horizon at this time of year.\n        Mark entered the residence hall building and turned into his room. Sparsely furnished, it contained a double bed, a small writing desk, an office chair, and the trunk of belongings he had brought from England for his months-long stay in the Antarctic. Dmitri was awaiting him in the room. While Mark was given free rein for the most part by the British sailors stationed on the island, the Soviets kept a much tighter watch on the comings and goings of their scientists. Dmitri had learned long ago to be careful when moving between the two bases. For the first two months of their relationship, Dmitri would wait until late at night during the shift change at the Russian station to head over to Mark\u2019s place. Even when being cautious, Dmitri would only make these trips once or twice per week.  Yet in recent days his carefulness had begun to slip. Dmitri had started walking over to the British base nightly. While Mark\u2019s heart told him this carelessness was really love sickness, Mark\u2019s head told him something else was going on with Dmitri.\n        As soon as Mark saw Dmitri\u2019s handsome, chiseled jawline and deep, brown eyes, he felt instantly elated but also ill. He did not want to confront Dmitri at all. But he couldn\u2019t ignore Dmitri\u2019s behavior anymore. For the last four weeks, he had noticed that Dmitri was frequently late for their rendezvous in the evenings. When he did arrive, things seemed normal, but Dmitri acted distant. It was as if the Antarctic chill had also chilled the connection between the two of them. Mark thought that he was just being paranoid about the first healthy relationship that he\u2019d had in years. \n        But that paranoia became justified the previous week. His friend Sally, a fellow British scientist who knew about Mark\u2019s relationship with Dmitri, had been moving between the buildings late one night and saw Dmitri out on the ice. Sally said that Dmitri was staring blankly at the docks used by the British navy to bring in supplies and troops on a weekly basis to the island. Sally had told Mark that this type of behavior made her concerned that Dmitri could be more than just a scientist, and that perhaps he was a Soviet informant. Mark knew that he had to give Dmitri the chance to confess and explain himself. After that, Mark would have some important decisions to make.\n        Mark sat on the bed next to Dmitri. Dmitri reached out and lovingly caressed Mark\u2019s cheek. In his own beautiful and broken English, he said, \u201cI am glad you asked me to come here tonight. I have been meaning to talk to you for a while now. I just don\u2019t want to keep up this facade any longer.\u201d\n        Mark sighed out loud and nodded. Dmitri had even started to look different. He had lost weight, and his skin was pale. It was as if guilt was transforming him from the inside out.\n        Dmitri continued, \u201cI have been hiding a secret from you. My love for you is deep and genuine. But I am not who you think I am.\u201d\n        Mark reached out and grabbed Dmitri\u2019s hand, hoping to give him the courage to continue.\n        \u201cYou see, I am not from Russia. I am from somewhere else, somewhere deeper. People around the world have given us different names; the Chinese call us Hai Ho Shang, and the South Americans refer to us as the Ipupiara. Dmitri, if he were still alive, would have probably called me a vodyanoy.\"\n        Mark drew his hand away, trembling, and clutched it to his chest. \u201cWhat do you mean, if Dmitri was still alive?\u201d\n        \u201cMy dearest Mark,\u201d the creature impersonating Dmitri said. \u201cDmitri loved you greatly, but so do I. Merpeople fall in love so easily, and it is both a terrible and a beautiful thing. I watched you from beneath the waves when you first arrived three months ago. And I knew I had to have you. Our siren songs are real, but they are not songs. Human beings are not so easily fooled. The fact that you fell in love with Dmitri not long after your arrival made my work all the easier. To gain a human\u2019s trust, merpeople occupy the skins of the loved ones of those they wish to wed. Dmitri\u2019s skin is an awkward fit, but after tonight I won\u2019t need the skin anymore. \n        Mark felt lightning-fast ribbons of anxiety course through his spine. Even though he was indoors, a chill ran through him to his very core. \n        \u201cWhat happens after tonight?\u201d Mark said this with a quiver in his voice.\n        Dmitri smiled big, revealing an extra row of razor-sharp teeth just above his gum line.\n        \u201cWhy, we go home, of course. Down into the deep, where we will dwell together for the rest of our lives. Well, for the rest of your life, at least.\u201d \n        And with that, Dmitri wrapped his arms in a loving embrace around Mark\u2019s neck; an embrace that grew tighter and tighter, squeezing Mark\u2019s airway shut and pushing him towards unconsciousness. Before he blacked out, Mark caught a glimpse of a third, iridescent and scaly eyelid just below Dmitri\u2019s own eyelids. \n        Mark had thought that the day he arrived on Deception Island, it was the coldest he had ever felt or would ever feel. \n        He was wrong.

She pressed her lips together, blotted them with a tissue, and then assessed her reflection. \n        Happy with what she saw, Bonnie put the lid back on her lipstick and grabbed her backpack from her bedroom floor. As she headed down the hallway to the kitchen, her little brother, Benji, emerged from his room, sleepily rubbing his eyes. \n        \u201cBon Bon!\u201d he shouted gleefully, clapping his hands. Bonnie smiled down at him, ruffling his chestnut-brown hair. Benji reached for her, and Bonnie picked him up, grinning and kissing his cheeks until he was breathless with giggles. \n        Bonnie carried Benji to the kitchen and set him down in his booster seat, strapping him in and kissing his forehead. Bonnie\u2019s mom set a bowl of dry cereal and a plate of orange slices in front of him. \n        Kissing Bonnie on the cheek, she said, \u201cThank you for bringing Benji in. What\u2019s on the agenda for today?\u201d \n        Bonnie grabbed an apple from the bowl on the counter, biting into it. \u201cI have a student council leadership meeting during homeroom and then cheer practice after school. If it\u2019s okay with you, the rest of the cheer squad wanted to grab dinner at Burrito Express after practice.\u201d Bonnie looked at her mom, hopefully. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry, hun, I picked up an extra shift tonight. I need you home to watch Benji.\u201d\n        Bonnie nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d \n        She kissed her mom on the cheek, ruffled her baby brother\u2019s hair again, and headed outside. Her boyfriend, Rick, was at the curb waiting to drive her to school. She threw her bag in the backseat and climbed into the front seat, kissing Rick quickly before buckling her seatbelt. \n        When they arrived at Clarksville High School, they headed inside in search of their friends. As the head cheerleader and captain of the football team, Bonnie and Rick were #couplegoals and the envy of most of their classmates. Everyone said Bonnie and Rick would be together forever, but Bonnie had her doubts. Rick had his sights set on a major university on the other side of the country, but Bonnie had to stay local so she could help her mom with Benji and live at home. They were only juniors, however, so Bonnie tried not to dwell on the future too much.\n        \u201cHey, girl!\u201d Her fellow cheerleader, Cherice, called out to her, waving. Bonnie waved back, pulling Rick over to the cafeteria table where their friends were gathered. \n        \u201cHey, y\u2019all,\u201d Bonnie said, taking a seat next to Cherice. She reached into the bag of donut holes sitting on the table and popped one into her mouth. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t go to Burrito Express tonight,\u201d she told them. \n        The girls groaned, whining. \n        \u201cWhy not?\u201d Cindy, Bonnie\u2019s least favorite on the squad, asked. \n        \u201cMy mom signed me up to volunteer at a homeless shelter in Cobey,\u201d she lied. \u201cIt\u2019ll look good on my college applications.\u201d \n        Cindy looked at her suspiciously, but didn\u2019t say anything. \n        \u201cOkay, well what about this weekend? Maybe we could all go get pedicures,\u201d another cheerleader, Samantha, suggested. \n        \u201cOh, I can\u2019t this weekend. I have SAT prep,\u201d Bonnie replied. In reality, she had a double shift at the Big Burger Diner in Cobey. It was a bit of a drive, but Bonnie couldn\u2019t risk running into any of her friends or classmates. She had been working at Big Burger since she turned sixteen last fall and had been using all of her earnings to pay for cheerleading, dinners with her friends, trendy clothes, and everything else she needed to fit in. She knew her mom would buy her these things if she could afford it, but even working as a full-time bookkeeper every weekday and picking up shifts at the Main Street Diner a couple of nights a week, she was still barely able to pay their bills. Bonnie couldn\u2019t imagine asking her mom for a cent of her hard-earned money to cover the frivolous trappings of high school popularity. However, Bonnie also couldn\u2019t imagine going through high school as a loser and an outcast. So, she worked at Big Burger every weekend and tutored a couple of kids in her AP Chemistry class twice a week.\n        \u201cYou have SAT prep every weekend,\u201d Rick whined. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the smartest girls in our class, why do you need so much help?\u201d\n        Bonnie just shrugged, popping another donut hole into her mouth to avoid answering. She had been having this fight with Rick at least once a week since they started dating last fall, and she was exhausted from it. She wished she could just tell Rick about her financial situation, but she knew that he would dump her if he knew she was poor.\n        Bonnie didn\u2019t particularly care about losing Rick, but she did care about keeping up appearances, and dating the captain of the football team was on-brand for the head cheerleader. Not to mention, if Rick knew about her finances, everyone else at school would know, too. Bonnie had sworn to herself when they had moved to Clarksville at the beginning of her eighth grade year that she would not be \u201cPoor Fatherless Bonnie\u201d here. She had done a great job of reinventing herself and creating a world where she was envied, sought after, praised. So, if she had to keep dating Rick and lying to her friends, that is exactly what she would do. \n        The following weekend, as Bonnie was getting ready for her shift at Big Burger, her phone rang. Incoming video call from Rick flashed across the screen. She groaned and checked her watch. She didn\u2019t have time for this. She tossed a hoodie on to cover her uniform polo and answered the call. \n        \u201cBabe, blow off SAT class and come to the mall with us!\u201d Rick shouted into the phone. It was noisy on his end. From the looks of it, he was in the backseat of a car. Bonnie could hear girls\u2019 voices in the background. \n        \u201cWho is \u2018us\u2019?\u201d she asked. \n        \u201cMe, Bobby, Joey, Cindy, and Krystal!\u201d he replied. \n        Ah, so the girl voices belonged to Bonnie\u2019s cheer squad frenemy and her bestie. Cool.\n        \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t. Have fun. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d Bonnie hung up the phone and tossed it into her satchel, along with her history textbook and a copy of Jane Eyre. If it was a slow night at the diner, she wanted to catch up on her homework so she didn\u2019t have to listen to Rick\u2019s complaints about her doing schoolwork during their date again. \n        She said goodbye to her mom, kissed Benji, and headed out the door. She checked her watch again: 11:35. Crap. Her shift was scheduled for noon, and it was at least a thirty-minute drive, and that was if there wasn\u2019t any traffic. She threw the car into gear and reversed out of the driveway. \n        Bonnie arrived at the diner a few minutes after twelve. She rushed in, tossing her bag into her locker. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said to her manager as she tied an apron around her waist. Her manager frowned, looking down at his watch. \n        \u201cBonnie\u2026\u201d he warned. \n        \u201cI know, it won\u2019t happen again!\u201d \n        Bonnie grabbed a pitcher of ice water and rushed over to serve her first table. \n        \u201cOh!\u201d she shrieked, dropping the pitcher of water to the floor. Cold water splashed her pants, chilling her legs and soaking her socks. The group of teens sitting at the table looked up at her in alarm. \n        \u201cOh. My. God. Bonnie?!\u201d Cindy and Krystal grinned wickedly at her, nudging each other under the table. Bonnie\u2019s face flushed, her cheeks matching her cherry-red lips. She avoided eye contact with Rick as she bent to wipe the spilled water from the floor. \n        \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were prepping for the SATs! Do you work here?\u201d Rick was standing over her, his expression unreadable. \n        Bonnie left the wet rags and ice cubes on the floor, and rushed to the employee bathroom, tears rolling down her face. She had worked so hard for the past four years to hide this part of her life from everyone and now here it was, splayed out in front of them. And of all the people to see her working at a diner, it had to be Cindy. Bonnie knew the entire school would know about her situation before the day was over. \n        She convinced one of the other waitresses to take Rick\u2019s table, and she hid in the employee bathroom until her boyfriend and classmates left the restaurant. When Rick had invited her to go to the mall with them, she had assumed he meant the mall in West Clairemont, not the rinky-dink rundown mall in Cobey.\n        When Bonnie got off work, she drove home in silence, fretting about how she was supposed to face the rest of the cheer squad and her other friends on Monday. Maybe she could just skip school next week. Or be homeschooled. Or move.\n        When she pulled into the driveway at home, she was surprised to see several of the other girls\u2019 cars parked at the curb in front of her house. Apparently, she wouldn\u2019t have to wait until Monday to hear everyone\u2019s snide remarks about her deceitful behavior and cutting insults about her financial situation. She took a deep breath and opened the car door. \n        When she walked into the house, she was surprised to see the girls crowded around her dining room table with her mom and Benji. Everyone was laughing, sipping sodas, and nibbling on cookies from the half-full plate in the middle of the table.\n        \u201cUm, hey,\u201d Bonnie said timidly. \n        The girls all looked up at her, and, it seemed to Bonnie, they were happy to see her. Maybe Cindy hadn\u2019t ratted her out after all. But then, why were they all at her house? She had never invited the squad over, for fear that they would see the generic groceries in the pantry or the discount box of laundry detergent in the cupboard. \n        Cherice was the first one to speak. \u201cBonnie, how could you keep your situation from us? You know we all love you! We don\u2019t care if you have five dollars or five thousand dollars. We love you, not your things!\u201d She stood up and embraced Bonnie. The rest of the girls followed suit, and soon, they were all hugging tightly in the middle of the kitchen, tears streaming down Bonnie\u2019s face. All this time, she had kept this secret and hidden this part of herself. Now, she was realizing that it had been completely unnecessary. These girls were her true and actual friends, and they loved her, even if she wasn\u2019t perfect. \n        \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing Cindy told all of you?\u201d Bonnie finally asked. \n        Samantha snorted. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t create a group chat without you fast enough. Unluckily for her, none of us gave a rat\u2019s patootie and her little scheme to ruin you was a failure.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah,\u201d Katie agreed. \u201cAnyone who actually knows you loves you, Bon, and anyone who cares about your money isn\u2019t a real friend anyway.\u201d \n        \u201cWell, I think Rick cares,\u201d Bonnie said. The girls laughed. \n        \u201cAnd who cares about Rick?\u201d they all shouted in unison."}

They rode through the streets on the back of a chariot drawn by four horses. The masses cheered and exalted the godlike leader. A slave stood behind the triumphant general, holding a crown above his head.  As they paraded through the roaring crowd, the slave would continuously lean in and whisper in the hero\u2019s ear, \u201cRespice post te. Hominem te esse memento. Memento mori.\u201d It was a humble reminder, \u201cLook behind. Remember thou art mortal. Remember you must die.\u201d\n        Emily was only dead for fifteen minutes. It was the perfect morning for her to receive a nudge from the universe, memento mori.\n        There was nothing Emily hated more than being busy. Every night, she set her alarm for five o\u2019clock, imagining how much she would accomplish if she got up an hour earlier. This particular morning, she snoozed until six-thirty. The dark cloud of dread consumed her as she thought about the day ahead: the meeting for the committee she volunteered for and immediately regretted, a working lunch, a business happy hour that was pitched as a great networking opportunity. She groaned and dragged herself out of bed and put on that busy badge of honor. Busy was how success was defined, so she put on that mask every morning so as not to disappoint.\n        The line for coffee was longer than usual. The dreaded orange barrels added twenty minutes to her already forty-five minute commute. Because she was late, she had to park a block away from work. In the thirty minutes she had missed of her workday, there were already ten marketing emergencies. Without a doubt, society would collapse if the posters with the new corporate logo could not be printed until Thursday. \n        Emily entirely missed what were almost the last moments of her life. Her response was critical to settle a heated debate. Which filter was best for their morning social media post? She was so busy tapping and swiping her phone, She never saw the tan midsize sedan that ran the red light and hit her.  \n        The muffled sounds of sirens and screams awoke Emily. That, and the feeling of her energy pull her from her body. A crowd of onlookers had formed, and she hovered above, trying to see what they were gasping and gawking at. The sea of people parted, and she saw the paramedics rush her into the back of an ambulance. \n        How could that be? She was awake. She could hear the quietest of sounds, see the slightest details, and smell the faintest aromas drifting in the air. It was like everything she had experienced in life was a clouded dream. Her heightened senses made this moment more real than reality.\n        Emily continued to float higher and higher. She drifted into a vast darkness that seemed to go on infinitely. She wasn\u2019t afraid. Rather, she felt like she was in a safe embrace. A brilliant light appeared. As she was drawn to the light, it soon enveloped her. She felt a love she did not have to earn through promises or deeds. She could let down the people-pleasing facade and be loved for her authentic self. \n        A tunnel of light swallowed her, and moments of her life surged through her. She experienced her niece\u2019s disappointment when Emily didn\u2019t show up for her first dance recital because of a work \u201cemergency.\u201d The joy of the impromptu weekend trip she and her husband took to go horseback riding in the mountains flooded over her. She felt so much peace in nature, yet that trip four years ago was the last time she had left the city. From just this morning, Emily felt her beloved golden retriever, Bo\u2019s, excitement drain to sadness. He dropped his favorite ball in front of her for her to throw. She completely ignored him as she tapped and swiped the almighty screen. An overwhelming feeling of regret broke through the light as she realized how little life she lived because she was so busy.\n        As Emily approached the end of the tunnel, the light delivered one last message, \u201cYou are enough.\u201d \n        With that, Emily tumbled back through the tunnel and landed in her body with a crash. \n        Machines beeped, metal clanked, and shoes squeaked as doctors and nurses bustled around Emily. \u201cWe have a pulse!\u201d Emily heard as she struggled to open her eyes. \n        Emily was in the hospital for a month. Civilization did not collapse because the new posters were not printed on time. Her first weekend out of the hospital, she, her husband, and Bo loaded up in the car and went to the mountains. These trips would become regular events rather than passing thoughts. \n        As they walked along the hiking trail, Bo dropped his ball at Emily\u2019s feet. Just then, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She picked up the ball and threw it far down the path. Bo zoomed after it. Emily ignored the phone. After all, she was busy. \n        Imagine how different the world would be if we all had someone continuously reminding us of our certain fate. As we sit in rush hour traffic, stare at screens, and order packages of stuff to fill the void, listen for the whisper: \n        Respice post te. Hominem te esse memento. Memento mori."}

I\u2019m tired of this struggle to survive, this need to succeed.\u201d Jacob was having one of his doubting episodes again and exclaiming loudly in the garage. Lily sat back and sighed as she listened from the living room. She wondered what triggered him this time; she could only hope that it would pass quickly so that he could get back to finishing his latest project. \n        Jacob, a disabled veteran, had spent the better part of his existence outside of the military trying to create the next big thing that would set them up for life. After all, it was the only thing left he could do in this job market. When he came back from the war, he had to take on a new life without both of his legs, which had to be amputated after barely surviving a bombing. You would think society would be a little more caring towards their soldiers that went to war to keep them safe, but that was not the case. Confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, the transferable skills from the military that he could use in civilian society, were physical not mental. All Jacob could do was try to find a way to help his wife provide for them, since jobs were few and far between. \n        Lily came into the garage and looked on as Jacob, filled with frustration and exhaustion, worked before saying, \u201cJacob, how about you take a break to clear your head.\u201d Jacob looked over at his wife in defeat; he didn\u2019t want to take a break, but he knew that if he didn\u2019t, she would give him an earful. It was best to not have to go through that because once she got going it would be hard for her to stop. \n        Jacob huffed and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take a break. But only because I have to go to the bathroom, not because you asked.\u201d Lily shook her head and rolled her eyes. She already knew he was taking a break because she asked him to. He just wanted to make light of the situation to hide his frustration. As Jacob went to the bathroom, Lily went into the garage to see what triggered his earlier outburst. On the workbench was his computer and his latest project. Looking at the computer, she saw the rejection letter from one of the many banks Jacob had applied to for a business loan. \n        Jacob came out of the bathroom and looked over at Lily sitting on the couch. He already knew she would go into the garage to see what was wrong, so he said, \u201cI assume you know what\u2019s wrong. I thought for sure this would be the one, but lo and behold, rejected again. I\u2019m so sorry, Lily. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be the man you fell in love with, who can provide for you. I will accept it if you want to leave me now. I\u2019m worthless.\u201d\n        Lily got up, went over to Jacob, and got on her knees in front of him and said, \u201cJacob, I love you with all my heart and there is nothing that will change that. Why do you always push me away when you are down? Why don\u2019t you ever let me help you? Yes, ever since you came back from the war, it has been hard for the both of us, but I stayed because I made a vow to love you for better or for worse. We can do this, honey, stop thinking that you have to do it alone.\u201d \n        Jacob looked down at his wife, he loved how strong she was even when he felt so weak. Lily got up and kissed him on the forehead, and then asked, \u201cwould you like some help getting back?\u201d He nodded and then Lily proceeded to roll him back to the garage. There, Jacob began to explain what he was working on. \n        \u201cHere\u2019s my latest project: I want to create a program that will allow veterans like me to bounce back into civilian life without having to go through the constant rejection that many of us go through when people see an amputee. The only thing is that I need a way to make some capital in order to fund this program. I\u2019m trying to figure out a useful thing that I can create and sell. The last thing I thought to create seemed like a dumb idea, so I abandoned it. I don\u2019t know what to do now.\u201d \n        \u201cLet me see what you made before you completely abandon it.\u201d Lily said. Begrudgingly Jacob handed her the object. It looked like a long pipe, with the sides cut open to insert something. After inspecting the object, Jacob handed over the plans he had drawn out. In the plans, Lily saw different components that Jacob hadn\u2019t created yet. Then she asked, \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d \n        \u201cWell honey, it is supposed to iron your clothes while they are in the dryer,\u201d Jacob said to Lily with a smile. \n        \u201cWow, that would definitely be useful! Plus, that would be one less thing I have to do when it comes to the chores around here.\u201d Lily said jokingly, even though Jacob knew she was dead serious. She hated ironing, it took too much time, and sometimes complained about the creases being in the wrong places. Jacob had thought of her when he came up with this idea, he would do anything to care for his wife. Especially since she had sacrificed everything to care for him when he should have been caring for her. But this was starting to feel like a lost cause after he put all his heart into making it.\n        Lily continued to look at the plans and the objects Jacob had already completed, then she took the pen from behind Jacob\u2019s ear and began to draw on the plans. As she was drawing she said, \u201cJacob my dear, it is not working because you forgot to add the most important part; of course it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d \n        Jacob took the plans from Lily, looked them over and burst into laughter. In between laughing fits, he said, \u201cWas that all I had to do? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I love and hate you at the same time. Come here.\u201d Jacob motioned for Lily to sit on his lap as he commenced kissing and hugging her. \n        \u201cI have a surprise for you Jacob, wait here,\u201d Lily went into the house to get a letter that had come that day. She handed it to Jacob, so he could take a look at it. \n        \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jacob asked, looking at the return address, which read Truce Bank. Opening the letter, he read that Lily had applied for a business loan and had been approved. The letter even read that the bank would be honored to support his business, even mentioning its name \u201cCapableWarriors\u201d, a name he had created with Lily. Tears welled up in his eyes because his dreams were finally going to come true, especially after he was ready to give up. He had given everything to this venture, and to think that all he needed to do was have faith in his wife and work together. \u201cI love you, Lily, thank you so much for being my lifeline and having faith in me.\u201d \n"}

Everyone has been trying to get him to slow down, but I don\u2019t think he is actually listening to anyone. Do you remember Dr. Genoa, the head of microbiology?

Can you imagine a more brutal irony than watching your wife die of the exact disease that you have spent your whole life studying? He thinks that it is his responsibility to save her.\n        It is awful for all of us, but he is taking it especially hard. I think he is struggling even more than Mom is. I don't know what to say to him. \n        This is a lot to ask, but I\u2019m wondering if you can try to get through to him.

The midwives calculated the moment of my birth down to the millisecond and identified which planets ruled which aspects of my personality. They then fed the data to the predictive algorithms favored by the privileged classes; algorithms that were and still are used for determining the ideal life path for a person before they\u2019d spent an hour outside the womb. Variations were allowed, of course, but only within a strict band of what was considered \u201cacceptable differentiation.\u201d\n        And the auguries were clear: I was best fit to be a priestess of Allaxia, goddess of bounty and kindness. My parents, pleased by this news, and grateful I wasn\u2019t called to be a knight protector of the empire, immediately set plans in motion. They planned my upbringing and my education, and recorded details such as the acceptable color palette of my room and in which order I would receive my birth-day gifts. They were so very careful to present these things as choices, as though I could exercise free will to determine the course of my life. \n        Younglings, when shown a narrow road and certain doom to either side, then told to follow the path laid out in front of them, will mostly do one of two things: they will rebel, or they will obey. \n        Is it any wonder, Archivist, that I threw myself into the life laid out for me by people who constantly reassured me that they loved me and wanted only the best for me?\n        As the years passed, I absorbed the goal determined by my planets and our machine intelligences for my own. I received the name Kylla on the eight anniversary of my birth, an adult name, meaning \u201cgiving\u201d - as in, the act of selfless giving for the benefit of others. \n        My younger sister was born four years after me, an acceptable span of time according to the rules of our class. She had been identified for the role of steward. An honorable role, to be sure, and rare. Stewards ruled not just their families\u2019 lands but the cities they were born to. She was a terror at first, my sister. When someone is told constantly that they\u2019re born to lead, the lesson takes root like a stubborn weed. \n        But my role as elder sister was clear. Until the day I left our house to become Allaxia\u2019s priestess, I would need to moderate my younger sister\u2019s impulses. After all, a steward cannot rule solely by demand; there are too many moving parts in the mechanism of a city, human and otherwise, that would resist or suffer from unreasonable orders. \n        From the day of my naming, it took five long years of patience, giving, and love, but in the end, my sister matured enough to receive her name: Olatlisan. Her name meant \u201cjoy of Olat,\u201d chosen to identify her as a future steward of our city, Olat.\n        Traditionally, after our naming day, we must spend ten years in preparation for our role. For priests and stewards, the standard is different due to the nature of our roles. In the case of those dedicated to a god or goddess, we must learn the gods-magics alongside more typical priestly duties. And for those meant to rule, they take more time, so they understand the workings of a city and how best to balance the needs of all the people of a city, both of the privileged and common classes.\n        I must record this, Archivist, for it does play a role: the common classes are those without a bloodline descended from the gods of our world, while the privileged classes can show their ancestry back to the mortal blessed by a particular god. Such things are tracked by both machines and genealogists, and mostly the privileged are bound by law and custom to make things better for everyone around them, as the gods did and do.\n        My training would demand sixteen years of my time, four of those at the Mother Temple. Olatlisan\u2019s training would take her sixteen years as well.\n        My sister demonstrated her readiness in twelve years.\n        Our parents were very proud of her, and truth be told, I was as well. She had matured far from the tyranny of her childhood, and Olat\u2019s previous steward was content to step aside and retire to an estate outside the walls.\n        I was sent to the Mother Temple after twelve years of training, to learn in seclusion and ready myself to serve in Olat\u2019s temple to Allaxia. Ours is not a way of quiet contemplation, for bounty of any form is to be shared and kindness cannot be demonstrated to an empty room. But as a priestess, I would need to know more than this, and so I learned computers and economics, astrology and history. Knowledge that would make the tasks of a priestess easier, beyond just the gods-magics.\n        Four things, Archivist. Four things broke me and made me what I am today, the day before my banishment.\n        When I turned twenty-four, I returned to Olat after four years, ready to take on the duties of a junior priestess of Allaxia. I discovered that my fellows were either venial and self-absorbed or worked to exhaustion trying to balance what the temple should be doing. The head priestess was one of the former; she said there was no reason for Allaxia\u2019s bounty to flow only outward. I became one of the latter, draining myself to the dregs to make sure that those who needed bounty \u2013 whether food, magic, money, resources, or some mixture of these \u2013 would receive it.\n        When I was twenty-six, Olatlisan had been in her position for a year, and the city seemed stable enough. But I was on the verge of\u2026 something. I do not know what. I would never abandon Allaxia, but I felt I could not continue as I had been. \n        Then my goddess, with crop-gold hair and buxom figure, came to me, in the waking world, in the midst of a temple meeting. Radiant and gentle, she spoke to me and said, \u201cA dry well gives no water, my priestess. We gods are inexhaustible, but you mortals are not.\u201d All there heard her, and all there knew her message was meant for me, and not only for me. Yet I was the one who received the honorary second-name of \u201cGoddess-Blessed.\u201d\n        Can you imagine, Archivist, what it is to be the target of a goddess\u2019 attention? Her words were a balm to my soul, yes. But her presence? It was a hammer to a clay pot. More cracks were forming in my sense of self, even as I rededicated myself to being the best priestess I could.\n        Reforms began almost immediately. The venial priests were humbled and began fulfilling their duties, while the rest of us learned to take better care of ourselves. Within a year, our temple began functioning as it was meant to, but it also became a place of pilgrimage. Of all the temples to Allaxia, of all the priests and priestesses, she came here to Olat, to me. \n        More pilgrims brought more prosperity to our city. But in the two years that followed Allaxia\u2019s visitation, the lives of the poor and struggling did not seem to improve. I watched, first in curiosity, then uncertainty, then horror, as the wealth coming to our city flowed to the center. Taxes that made no sense, regulations that resulted in fees and fines, even the funds that normally went to the temples for support began to dry up.\n        When I was twenty-eight, I went to see my sister. Even though I was merely a priestess, and she was the steward of Olat, she granted me the boon of her time without requiring an appointment.\n        \u201cDear sister,\u201d she said when I entered the room. I stared in despair at her surroundings. Here was where all the wealth had gone: expensive furnishings, foods from distant lands, and more servants than a steward could properly need. I knew how to mask what I thought and felt, but my sister had watched me from the time she was born. She knew.\n        \u201cIt seems like you take issue with how I rule?\u201d She asked this sweetly, and I saw the trap for what it was. But I could not care. My world had broken just a bit more.\n        She continued, \u201cYour lessons were well taken, my sister. But all you taught me was how to lie well enough that no one, not even you, could see what was in my heart. Take comfort, though. I am sated for now, and wealth will begin flowing outward again.\u201d She paused. \u201cNot so much as before, but enough.\u201d\n        I wanted to say something. I wanted to scream at her. But I also recognized that my drive to become a priestess had affected my sister and my city. I bowed, ready to leave, and Olatlisan granted me access to the Birth Archives for two hours.\n        \u201cJust so you see how your chart led you to this place,\u201d she smirked. Those were the last words she spoke to me.\n        Two hours in the Birth Archives. Two hours when I put the Mother Temple\u2019s teachings to good use, skills my sister could not know I had learned. Where I discovered the last thing that shattered me. \n        My chart was clearly marked with signs of Allaxia\u2019s attention, but this was not what broke me. \n        My sister\u2019s chart was simply wrong. Whether the midwife had deliberately falsified the data, or simply mis-entered it, the hour of my sister\u2019s birth was incorrect. On the original chart, the second moon sat in the house of leadership, in the segment of authority. But I knew the hour of her birth well, having been there, and her chart should have shown that her second moon sat in the segment of tyranny. Had the data been entered accurately, she would never have been chosen as a steward.\n        As I sat there, stunned, my goddess spoke to me for the second time. \u201cYour memory is correct, and the truth must come forward.\u201d \n        So here I sit, Archivist, in the hours before my banishment. My drive to become a priestess, even though the path was clearly mine, meant that my sister had been able to hide her tyranny. But my duties as a priestess were clear. I corrected the data to ensure the system would confirm my accusations, then I told everyone in Olat what had been done, what my sister was capable of. \n        Within hours, she was removed and banished to the Southern Wastes, and the previous steward installed. There would be a very long wait for the next steward, but Olatmadel would restore the city in that time. The midwife was discovered to have falsified the information on the instruction of my parents, and all three were imprisoned.\n        Olatmadel was as gentle as he could be to me, but I would still be banished for the crime of altering the Birth Records. \u201cI wish it were otherwise, but the laws are clear,\u201d he said sadly in our meeting. \u201cThe best I can do is to give you freedom beyond the walls, but you cannot stay here in Olat.\u201d\n        The Mother Temple cannot take me. No city will have me within its walls, for fear that I will bring the goddess a third time. Perhaps I will establish a simple shrine, in a safe and temperate place. To teach the lesson that having a goal is good, but that one cannot ignore the impact of that goal on others.\n"}

Make it about a man, born in 1955 in Delbert, Texas, whose mother died in childbirth with him. He learns from his father that the mother wanted him to become a preacher, and he believes that this is his destiny. We get some back story about the loss of his mother in his childhood. Specifically, his siblings blame him. The only exception is his sister who is five years older and closest to him in age. The first-person narrator has worked his way through college with the help of the sister and her husband, a car dealer. The narrator has attended some seminary but has not yet completed his degree. Facts about the origins of his scriptural text have shaken his faith. However, he is the fill-in pastor at a small church for the summer and must find a way to minister to people even though he is no longer sure of his beliefs and now questions if all the work was worth it. A family with a sick little girl needs him to help them cope. ","targets":"        My mama, Emma Louise, died in childbirth with me. 1955. Delbert, Texas. We didn\u2019t have a hospital close by, and it all came on so suddenly. My aunt Arlene was helping Mama with me like she had helped with all my siblings before me, but there wasn\u2019t a thing Arlene or anybody else could do for her. The doctor finally got to the house, but Mama had lost too much blood. My older brothers and sisters hated me for it. They told me it was my fault, that I took their mama away from them. As if she wasn\u2019t my mama too. Daddy didn\u2019t love me all that much either, but he loved our mama, and so he tolerated me. Some of the time, anyway.\n        Every once in a while, he would talk about her when I was little, mostly at night. I had to be under six when he told me because Stepmother wasn\u2019t with us yet. She didn\u2019t like hearing about her competition, I guess, so he didn\u2019t talk about our mama much more after that.\n        \u201cShe loved goin\u2019 to church, loved singin\u2019 the hymns. She wanted one of y\u2019all boys to be a preacher. Your two brothers are older and joined the Air Force, so it has to be you, son.\u201d\n        It was true. I think they thought Mama couldn\u2019t have any more babies, but then there she was, pregnant with me. My sister Loudean is the closest to me in age, and she was five when I was born. She remembered Mama the least, so she was the nicest one to me. Loudean more or less raised me, truth be told. I\u2019m twenty-three now, and she still buys me clothes when Tim\u2019s Men\u2019s Store in town has a sale. Charlie, her husband, owns a used car lot and doesn\u2019t mind her soft spot for me. He let me work there in the summers, so I could go to college. I cleaned and polished cars, swept up around the shop, helped Sam the parts man when he needed me to fetch things. I studied business at school, and Charlie even started letting me do some of the books for him once I got up into college.\n        A thing happens when you tell a little boy that his dead mama\u2019s wish was for him to grow up to be some certain thing. It takes root. It becomes a part of him. Or at least it did for me. I never questioned my future after that. I was a stubborn little fella, and I decided that I would figure out how to be a preacher and then be one. One thing I had going for me was that I was good in school, as I found out not long after Daddy told me about Mama\u2019s wish.\n        I was in the second grade when I stopped to talk to our preacher one Sunday after service when he was shaking hands with everybody as they left.\n        \u201cBrother James, sir. Could you tell me something?\u201d\n        \u201cWhat is it, son?\u201d He was a kindly man, much gentler than my daddy, to be honest.\n        \u201cHow do you get to be a preacher?\u201d\n        \u201cWell, Marty, you gotta love the Lord, and I know you do.\u201d I nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve gotta go to college these days, so you can go to seminary. You can\u2019t just get ordained. You need real training on how to run a church and minister to people.\u201d\n        That sounded daunting, but I pressed on anyway. \u201cWhat\u2019s a seminary?\u201d\n        \u201cOh, that\u2019s a special school where you study the Good Book and learn how to give sermons and talk to people when life\u2019s got them down.\u201d\n        And that\u2019s how I ended up where I am now, at Greens Chapel in Cowtown, Texas, population 788. It\u2019s a summer fill-in job while they find a new preacher. Brother James never told me what seminary was gonna be like. He never went, I guess. I\u2019ve been there one year, and I've learned so much about the Good Book, like he told me I would. But he didn\u2019t know what they teach at the seminary. I learned about all the translations, the different manuscripts, and the parts that some committee in the Middle Ages decided not to include. I never thought about how our holy book came to be; I guess I just thought it fell out of the sky. But it turns out, it was written down by people.\n        All of that got me questioning, though. I wonder what kinda deity would start a little boy off in life with no mama, or let my mama die when she had five kids, three of them still at home. It\u2019s a big universe, and I was just a little boy. I don\u2019t know what I believe anymore, to be honest. And here I am supposed to be the preacher for the summer, to tell these people something about living their lives right.\n        They set me up in a little room in old Miss Markum\u2019s house. She\u2019s a retired teacher and a longtime member of the church. On my first day, alone in the tiny church office, I got a call from a Mr. Davis, whose little girl is bad sick with some kind of blood cancer. I don\u2019t know what omnipotent being would let a baby girl suffer like that, but they called me. \n        I don\u2019t know what I believe anymore, to tell you the truth. But they need me to pray over little Anna, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. The universe is too big for a sick little girl, and she needs me to make it smaller for her. And if I don\u2019t give her that comfort, who will?\n        I know what I\u2019m here to do now.\n"}
{"example_id":"example_024","inputs":"Write about a dung beetle who has dedicated everything in their life towards rolling a ball of dung up a hill and now questions if it was worth it. The dung beetle's nickname is Gus, and he was just married to another dung beetle. His love for his new wife drives him to work extra hard to please her. This results in him dedicating his life to rolling a ball of dung up a huge hill, so his wife could have a spectacular view at the top. His Sisyphean struggle included having the dung roll back on him at least twice. By the time he rolled the dung to the top of the hill, it had become so cold that him and his wife had to bury the dung ball before he could see a single sunrise from the top. The story must be at least 1400 words long.","targets":"        Mr. Onthophagus Taurus, or Gus for short, took his new wife dung hunting. They were bound and determined to find the perfect abode to start their new life together. Mrs.Taurus could be considered an exceptionally demanding beetle, but to Gus she was the sun and moon. He loved the way that the starlight sparkled off her exoskeleton on clear nights, and he swore to himself he would do whatever it took to make her the happiest beetle in the whole wide world. \n        He just blissfully scuttled next to his wife while she perused the heaping piles of elephant dung. \n        She stopped in front of a particularly large mound and said, \u201cDarling, this looks promising.\u201d She pointed out one perfectly round ball wedged close to the summit. It looked majestic with the evening sun shining through the cloud of gnats that danced around the dung. \n        \u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the one I want! Oh Gus, won\u2019t it just make the most perfect home to start a big family in?\u201d \n        \u201cIt looks wonderful!\u201d he responded, but if he was honest, it looked like any other ball of dung. This is the one that Mrs. Taurus wanted, so he began his arduous climb up the mound to dislodge their new lodgings. It took him a couple of hours to reach the top of the pile, and it took a couple of days to push it off the summit. \n        Finally, Gus watched as it plummeted to the earth, his wife waiting eagerly at the bottom. At the moment of the free fall, he panicked and prayed to the Scarab Beetles in the Sky that it didn\u2019t break apart the moment it hit the ground. By their grace, the ball stayed intact, rolling just a bit as Mrs. Taurus flitted around it gushing over its nutrient density, how beautiful the shade of brown is, and how the size of it was perfect for growing their family. \n        Gus awkwardly stumbled back down, half climbing and half flailing, until he landed with a great thud on his back, kicking up dust as he tried desperately to right himself. He called out desperately to his wife. \n        \u201cDarling! Can you help me up? I\u2019m stuck!\u201d \n        It took a couple of shouts before she tore herself away from the lovely visage of their new home. \n        \u201cOkay, okay\u2026 I\u2019m coming. Don\u2019t get your horn in a knot,\u201d she said. Mrs. Taurus ambled over to him and pushed Gus back over with her back legs. \u201cThere, all better. Now let\u2019s start looking for the perfect spot to settle down.\u201d  \n        Gus balked for a brief moment, but he recovered quickly. \n        \u201cWhat do you mean the \u2018perfect spot\u2019? I thought we would just push it over to that tree. I mean, we are burying it after all.\u201d \n        He pointed his foreleg towards the base of a massive tree just a few feet away. \u201cI figured that the tree would also provide us a bit more protection too.\u201d \n        Mrs. Taurus scoffed and said, \u201cCome on now, Gus. Who needs a tree, when there\u2019s such a big, strong beetle here to protect them?\u201d He blushed about as hard as a dung beetle could blush, and puffed up as much as his exoskeleton would allow. \n        \u201cYou know what? You are absolutely right, who needs a stinkin\u2019 tree? I\u2019ll protect you and all our offspring!\u201d he said.\n        \u201cWonderful! I have the perfect spot in mind for our home.\u201d Mrs. Taurus immediately perked up and pointed toward the tallest and steepest hill he had ever seen in his entire life. She could barely curb her enthusiasm as she explained her reasoning, \n        \u201cThe view from the top of the hill will be breathtaking! I mean, just imagine watching the sunrise from our dung ball every day! Wouldn\u2019t that be a dream-come-true?\u201d \n        Gus struggled to hide the trepidation on his face. His antenna twitched in slight annoyance as he sized up all the steep drops and large rocks that dotted the side of the hill. \n        \u201cUmm, sure. But it\u2019s pretty far from here, and I\u2019m not sure if I can roll it up there before it starts getting cold.\u201d \n        His wife responded, \u201cYou can do it! I have nothing but faith in you.\u201d He still eyed the hill with uncertainty \n        \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get started.\u201d\n        He rubbed his poor aching legs in the shadows, while they relaxed at the bottom of the hill. It took Gus a full week of non-stop rolling to make it there. The hill suddenly looked much more like a mountain, the rocks he eyed up a week ago magically transformed into boulders. But they had come too far to turn back. Mrs. Taurus was anxious to get back on the ball. Her dream life was so close yet so far away, and the annoyance was beginning to creep into her voice. \n        \u201cCome on! We can\u2019t afford to waste much time. The temperature will drop soon,\u201d she said. \n        Gus sighed and began to roll the ball of dung up the steep embankment. His wife hopped up on the top to look straight ahead while he struggled under the weight of their future life together.\n        For the next six months, Gus pushed his ball of dung and his wife up the side of the mountain. He often stumbled and fell backwards several yards. He lost count of how many times he almost gave up. In those moments, he was exhausted, and his legs shook like grass rattling in a strong wind. The only thing that kept him going was his wife\u2019s shouts of encouragement, and the promise of the sunrise he will see from the summit. \n        Twice, Gus was just an inch away from the top hill when his trembling body gave out on him. He was a beetle on fire. His whole body screamed out for him to stop, but when he refused to give up, his body gave up for him. \n        Yet again, he was crushed under the weight of his load - and failure. If a beetle could sob, he would have drowned himself in tears ten times over. These two incidents put them back two months each. \n        Slowly, the sunrise in his mind became more and more spectacular. The more effort he put into pushing this dung up the hill, the more beautiful he imagined the summit sunrise would be, but time was running out, and every passing night grew colder and colder. Gus knew that if they didn\u2019t reach the top soon, they would freeze to death before they could even start their life together. \n        Once again, Gus found himself inches away from the summit of the mountain. He could see the rays of the setting sun hit the ground in front of him. His wife, who was in her usual spot, began to shield her eyes against the sudden light and exclaimed wildly. \n        \u201cGus, you are almost there! Oh my Beetles! I can see the top! The view is incredible! You can\u2019t give up now!\u201d\n        He gathered what little strength he had left. Gus strained every muscle in his body, if he had teeth, he would be bearing down on them with jaw breaking force. With a Herculean push, the ball of dung cleared the last ledge and Mrs. Taurus jumped down on the level ground in complete ecstasy. Gus simply slumped over on his back, unable to catch his breath. He laid there in shock until the light of the day disappeared completely on the horizon. He struggled to recover when Mrs. Taurus walked over to him and said. \n        \u201cOkay, now that we are here, let\u2019s start burying this thing.\u201d \n        Gus bolted back to his feet. \u201cWhat do you mean? What about the view! What about the sunrise? I spent almost half my life pushing this turd up a mountain. I\u2019m going to see this spectacular sunrise.\u201d\n        Mrs. Taurus simply shook her head. \u201cNo, we have to bury it tonight. It\u2019s too cold to stand around out here, plus I\u2019ve waited so long to start our family. I won\u2019t wait a moment longer.\u201d She huffed off and muttered under her breath, \u201cPlus, if you hadn\u2019t taken so long to push it up the hill, then maybe we could have watched a couple of sunrises together.\u201d \n        Gus watched her scuttle off towards their home. The stars were slowly emerging in the sky, and surfaced from the inky depth of Mrs. Taurus\u2019 exoskeleton. A smear of light streaked across her back, but he had no wishes left to make. \n        He stopped briefly and wondered how his life would have turned out, had he been a stag beetle. But he wasn\u2019t a stag, and he had spent half his life working to get to this place. He wasn\u2019t getting any younger, and the cold night was beginning to slow his movements. \n        With a sigh, Gus turned to the hole Mrs. Taurus was starting to dig, and he joined in.\n"}

I just had a very difficult conversation with a relative who thinks I spend too much time working and studying, and not enough time with the family. I have heard this conversation in many forms, from many people, throughout my adult life. It always happens when I go home and then everyone wants a piece of my time. There is only so much to give, and then I get the lecture when someone feels slighted. \n        Meanwhile, the reason I can\u2019t see certain people is that they are working, and work comes first. I\u2019m sure you can see the problem here. If I point this out, it only makes matters worse. Believe me, I fantasize about pointing out the hypocrisy to them. But, it would only end in the inevitable, \u201cOh, you think you\u2019re so smart because you are in graduate school\u201d talk.\n        These lectures, while I am used to them, are salt on an open wound presently. So, back to the song I was playing at the start of this conversation, to illuminate my feelings, and the situation for you a little bit. The song, What I Did for Love, is about an \u201colder\u201d dancer starting again in the chorus line because her relationship did not work out and it impacted her career. The stress on the relationship was in part because of her career. Love for the dancer is both love of a person, and love of her career. She is at a crossroads in life and is reflecting upon her choices, as am I. \n        For the moment, my focus is on the career side. You see, I have just graduated. Like today was the day. I\u2019m staring at my diploma, my get out of jail, or congratulations, you survived graduate school certificate. I should be happy, excited about the future. I am not.\n        I started the day off excited, but the joy fell off a cliff with an unfortunate call from a family member. Why did I pick up the phone? After all, no good was going to come from the conversation. But I always have hope. Hope that was wasted on this call, let me tell you.\n        This call, like most other family calls, ends in me freaking out about things the moment I hang up. They know how to push my buttons, and cause self-doubt to swirl around me like sharks around a school of fish. Given that this is my graduation day, it hits me harder than usual. I feel  like I just dove head first into icy water.\n        I wonder why today, of all days, they couldn\u2019t just say \u201cCongratulations!\u201d But no, they had to say \u201cWell I hope it was worth it, what are you going to do with that?\u201d Like it is any of their business. Do they pay my bills? No.\n        Nevertheless, I can\u2019t help but wonder, is the love of my career worth it? So many sacrifices are made to be successful. The lonely hours of reading, researching, writing, editing, and repeating this process are endless. Then there is the day job to support myself. The negative feedback in graduate school is soul crushing. After all of this, I emerge from the melee into the scorn of my family who think what I do is useless at best.\n        What am I going to do with that, I repeat in a falsetto voice. I sob. Happy graduation day to me! \n        I slowly become aware of the song playing from my phone, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to worry about me \u2018cause I\u2019m alright, I don\u2019t need you to tell me it\u2019s time to come home,\u201d Oh, Billy Joel, you always know what to say to a girl. I dry my eyes and begin to dance around the house to My Life. My dog is going crazy, running around and squeaking her toy. She is looking at me with eyes that say \u201cTime to paaaaaaaaaaarty!\u201d As I continue to sing, I realize this is my life, this moment with my music and my dog. It is happening here and now because of the path I choose to walk. It is enough.\n        I think back briefly to the unfortunate call and realize that, regarding my family, I have no regrets. My relationship with them does not suffer because of the time I spend on my career path, it suffers because they can\u2019t accept the path I choose. It took me a long time to come to this realization. I mean, in the end, strictly speaking, it only took a mini breakdown and some Billy Joel to sort it. \n        My family and I will always have the same conversation, but my life is my life. Most of the pain of the family situation has settled for me. What remains is just a sense of resignation, and the voice of Billy Joel singing, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say anymore this is my life, go ahead with your own life, leave me alone.\u201d\n        As for my career, my graduate studies make me who I am. It informs the way I think, and how I understand my place in the world. To go totally clich\u00e9 with you, the experience was the best of times and the worst of times. Ok, sorry, I had to get that out of my system, no more coffee for me, ha! \n        However, clich\u00e9 the saying, it is true. That is why my playlist has so many bittersweet songs on it. They reflect my experiences. Sorrow mixed with joy, determination, a desire to learn, and to grow as an individual. I love my life and all it entails, even the hardships. As I look at my diploma with my name inked in black, I think of the ending of the song, What I Did for Love, \u201cI can\u2019t regret, won\u2019t regret, what I did for love.\u201d"}

Pure white, smooth, and free of blemishes, Keran was a fine example of an egg. As he prepared himself for the cold phase, he turned in his seat to face his fearless leader.\n        \u201cSir?\u201d Keran said. \u201cThat\u2019s two more gone today. Including us, that leaves six soldiers left to deploy.\u201d\n        Sitting across from Keran, in the top left corner of the egg carton, was Tamago. Tamago was an older egg, with a seam running across his underside that bordered on being a crack. He let out a huff, shifting around in his seat to face Keran.\n        \u201cTwo? Interesting.\u201d As Tamago spoke, Keran could see the breath exiting his lips turn to vapor as their vessel entered the cold box. \u201cIt was three yesterday. Perhaps it was too heavy of a meal? Or there\u2019s one less mouth to feed today.\u201d\n        Keran frowned. \u201cWhat does it matter, sir?\u201d\n        The door to the cold box shut. The world went dark.\n        \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Tamago repeated, incredulous. \u201cHow could you possibly say that?\u201d\n        \u201cI just don\u2019t see how it matters how many of us they eat at a time, sir.\u201d\n        Had he been some abomination of an egg bestowed with hands, Tamago would have slapped Keran across the face. Instead, he shuffled angrily in his cardboard throne. \u201cYou don\u2019t see how it matters? Have you lost your mind, Keran? What else in life matters for us? Nothing! Have you forgotten our purpose?\u201d\n        \u201cI remember, sir,\u201d Keran said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve read the scriptures, just as you have.\u201d\n        Tamago turned to face the etchings on the walls of their cardboard tomb, words that served as a solvent to the soul of a lost egg. \n        \u201cTo be consumed by the great flesh beings and rejoin our brethren in the afterlife,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt is a beautiful fate, is it not?\u201d He looked back at Keran, scowling. \u201cHow could you abandon your studies so, Keran? We both exited the same hen. We\u2019re practically brothers.\u201d\n        \u201cI think that means we\u2019re literally brothers.\u201d\n        \u201cTechnicalities.\u201d\n        Keran shook his head. \u201cSir, I just...

About worse fates that can befall an egg.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd woe be upon the egg who is cracked or splintered,\u201d Tamago recited, \u201cfor he shall be denied the finality of the cardboard vessel and instead be tossed aside, cracked and splintered upon the ground.

Should you not have this memorized?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2026\u201d Keran shook his head. \u201cYou know that I have been as devout as you, sir.

Where does it go?\u201d\n        Tamago said nothing, lips pursed.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s tossed out into a landfill,\u201d Keran said. \u201cIt\u2019s abandoned and left to seep into the earth, or it\u2019s used as\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cFertilizer,\u201d Tamago whispered.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie, sir,\u201d Keran said. \u201cNone of this matters.

Surrounded by beautiful things and modern conveniences, he suddenly felt out of place. His dark skin, cracked with wrinkled lines from a decade of working in the logging fields of the Amazon, had not softened with his wealth and status. His jet-black hair was now streaked with white, and at the age of sixty, he was finally feeling the weight of those years.  In fact, he felt more tired now than he had on his longest days of hacking at tree trunks or stripping bark. All of his life\u2019s work had led him to this place and time. But though El Fuerte had accomplished all of his life goals, he was no longer sure if he wanted this life anymore. El Fuerte was even more disturbed by his clear understanding that it had all been a sham. And that thought, for the first time in decades, made him intensely afraid. \n        His people called him El Fuerte which means \u201cthe strong\u201d in Spanish. But he had not begun his life strong. He was born with the name Pakal into an impoverished family on the periphery of the shrinking rainforest in the tiny South American nation of Macondo. He had lived a largely traditional Indigenous upbringing, learning the uses of all plant and animal life, and learning how to balance that use with a respect for the forest.\n        Pakal learned these practices from his mother. Pakal\u2019s mother was an Indigenous woman who had never once left her community. His father was a Catholic priest and missionary from Brazil who had stayed in the region to continue converting the local population after meeting Pakal\u2019s mother. But as a man of the cloth, Pakal\u2019s father never officially acknowledged Pakal or his relationship with his mother. His father later succumbed to typhoid fever in 1949, when Pakal was only six years old. His mother died of an unknown wasting disease not long after he turned sixteen. He left the rainforest village he had called home this same year, joining a group of loggers who traveled along the edges of the forest working for various international companies harvesting lumber. \n        In the logging camps of the region, Pakal became El Fuerte. He walked out of the camp one night and did not return for eight days. The loggers sent out a search party into the forest, but could not find him. He returned at midnight on the eighth day of the camp, and proclaimed to the loggers that he had a vision while wandering through the jungle.\n       In this vision, he saw the rainforest burning. He saw Indigenous peoples walking out from under the forest canopy dressed in painted faces, not of mourning, but of wartime. The ground smoked, and the earth split. From this split in the earth, the Virgin Mary emerged. She spoke to Pakal and told him that the only way to save his people was to burn down their past. He alone could conquer the chaos, and to do so, he had to conquer the earth itself.\n       Pakal emerged from this vision a changed man. He began holding religious meetings in the logging camps. Within three years, he had a following of over 2,000. Within six years, he was considered the head of the Church of Pakal, a hybridization of Amazonian Indigenous traditional beliefs paired with Catholic iconography. By the age of thirty, Pakal led multiple communities on the periphery of the rainforest, and he had crafted a militant subdivision of his most zealous followers.\n       The religion spread like wildfire across Macondo, thanks in part to Pakal\u2019s sermons, which were written down and spoken far and wide via his followers. To powers such as the United States and Europe, Pakal seemed like a bizarre cult leader from the jungle. But to believers, Pakal was a savior. \n       Pakal had decided long ago that to defeat the external forces that so often caused chaos in his country, his people must completely transform their approach to the environment. Rather than focusing on conservation and stewardship, Pakal called for self-preservation through consumption. Pakal nominated his Indigenous followers to head harvesting teams. They set up processing plants for lumber along the edges of the jungle and began to hack down every tree of value they could find. Pakal gave his hunters special titles that he claimed were handed to him by God. These hunters then went deep into the rainforest to capture or kill any animals deemed useful for food or for selling on the black market. The government of Macondo at the time was imploding with corruption and petty competitions for power between various politicians. Mired in their own selfish pursuits, no one saw Pakal for the threat he truly was. \n        In 1974, when Pakal was in his early thirties, he decided that the time was right to bring salvation to the rest of Macondo. In a sweeping coup, he used his paramilitary group to strong-arm their way into the capital with little violence in what would later be known as the \u201cOrchid Revolution.\u201d Pakal allowed the government leaders to flee the country or go into hiding. He avoided violence as much as he could, arguing that the dirt under their feet was what his followers should conquer. It was during this coup that the name Pakal fell by the wayside, and \u201cEl Fuerte '' became the supreme leader of the nation of Macondo. \n       Macondo shut down the borders of the country, and the nation fell into shadow for all outsiders. El Fuerte focused all of his efforts on proselytizing to the population. He knew that no cult could be successful without utter devotion. El Fuerte moved to the capital and into the Governor\u2019s Palace. He spent the next three decades building up his support base, exiling his political rivals, and making his image into one of a godlike leader to be loved and feared simultaneously. \n        Now, as El Fuerte glanced at his sixty-year old reflection in his gilded mirror, he thought about his legacy. There had not been political violence or a revolution since he came to power. The religion he founded, known as Pakalism, had spread like wildfire over the years. El Fuerte had no real idea who were true believers and who were not, as all citizens were mandated to attend church weekly or face fines or imprisonment. Military service was also mandated for both men and women, creating a devotion to the state as well as the church. In addition, El Fuerte had recently overseen the creation of an elaborate and large border wall. Constructed of rainforest hardwoods and natural thorny jungle vines, he believed it was a symbolic and effective deterrent to both immigration into and out of his country.\n       El Fuerte had given over the rainforest wholeheartedly to his followers, many of whom were Indigenous, and they in turn continued to profit immensely from its destruction. Logging still boomed across the jungle, but so did a burgeoning pharmaceutical industry. While tourists were not allowed into the country, researchers were given visas at a record-setting pace. The upper echelon of El Fuerte\u2019s followers, through this access to pharmaceutical development, in turn amassed a wealth they never could have imagined for themselves before Pakalism came into their lives. \n       But then, last night, El Fuerte\u2019s mother came to him in a dream. She was crying, and when he asked her what was wrong, she held out empty hands. That emptiness woke him in the dead of night. He could not forget such a vacant feeling. \n        El Fuerte had achieved something few dictators had in world history: a stable government that did not perpetuate itself through violence. At least, not violence alone. El Fuerte chose not to receive reports from his ministry of enforcement, as he did not want to know about the methods they used on those deemed a threat to his power. But El Fuerte did know that his people had no choices in this life.\n        In his quest to eliminate the chaos that had plagued his childhood and the childhoods of his Indigenous brethren, he had taken away all autonomy from the citizens of Macondo. He had committed himself to this goal, foregoing marriage and children to give the image of utter devotion to his followers. The rainforest that birthed him was in shambles. Western scientists railed against him in newspapers across the globe, calling him the planet killer as he burned a trail of destruction across one of Earth\u2019s most important natural resources. He had always contended that they wanted to take power over these resources from the people of Macondo. But he saw that the bulk of the profits from the pharmaceutical companies flowed directly back to the CEOs in the United States and Europe.\n        It was his religion that bothered him most of all. He had committed himself to its construction, meticulously going over the narrative of his special vision decades ago in the forest. He had told himself that the lie would bring peace, and that peace by any means was validated.. But that peace had come at a costly price for all, including himself. The old man wondered if, at some point, El Fuerte had become more real than Pakal. After all, if the fiction is believed for long enough, won\u2019t belief, with time, transform fiction into fact?\n"}

She stopped to check her list: confirm Cassie\u2019s cap and gown delivery. She would have to do that later, when the shop opened. She moved on to the next thing, ordering Jake\u2019s varsity baseball gear.\n        \u201cMom!

You need to leave for school in five minutes! Where is your shirt?\u201d \n        Her son grinned at her. \u201cChill out, mom, it\u2019s in the dryer,\u201d he said. He grabbed his shirt and cleats from the laundry room and raced back upstairs to finish getting ready. \n        Penelope finished the grocery order and then walked to the base of the stairs. \n        \u201cJake! Cassie! It\u2019s time to go!\u201d \n        Her children appeared at the top of the stairs, backpacks in hand.\n        \u201cDid you sign my permission slip?\u201d Cassie asked. \n        \u201cCan we give Billy a ride to the game Saturday?\u201d Jake asked. \n        \u201cYes and yes,\u201d Penelope responded. She handed each of them a granola bar, kissed them on the cheek, and waved goodbye as they climbed into Cassie\u2019s early-graduation gift, a cherry-red convertible. The kids waved goodbye as they reversed out of the driveway.\n        Once they were gone, Penelope went back into the house. She reheated her now-cold cup of coffee and took a seat at the kitchen island. She scrolled through emails as she sipped her drink. \n        Dylan came out of his office and set his mug on the counter. \n        \u201cCan you put that in the dishwasher?\u201d Penelope asked, gesturing toward the mug. \n        \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d he responded, not looking up from his phone. He grabbed a bagel from the tray on the counter and walked back to his office, closing the door behind him.\n        Penelope sighed, picking up her phone to call and confirm Cassie\u2019s graduation dinner reservations for the following weekend. She couldn\u2019t believe that her baby girl was graduating from high school in less than two weeks. She tried not to think about it, as she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to function if she gave it too much thought. Instead, she buried herself in tasks and to-do lists.\n        A few hours later, as she was preparing herself a sandwich for lunch, Dylan came out of his office again. \n        \u201cDid my assistant drop off my flight information for next week?\u201d he asked. \n        Penelope stared at him. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \n        \u201cI need to meet with a few clients in San Bernardino. I\u2019m flying out Wednesday, and I\u2019ll be back Sunday afternoon.\u201d \n        Penelope\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cUm, Dylan, did you check the dates for this trip? Your daughter graduates from high school that Saturday. You can\u2019t be on a business trip during her high school graduation!\u201d\n        Dylan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll celebrate with her when I return on Sunday. Cassie will understand. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d \n        Penelope\u2019s mouth fell open, and she worked to control her voice. \u201cNo big deal? Cassie graduating from high school isn\u2019t a big deal to you?\u201d \n        \u201cPenelope, you\u2019re overreacting. This is my job. I have to go.\u201d \n        \u201cOverreacting? Your job? Are you serious right now? This is your child!\u201d \n        \u201cI told you when you wanted to get pregnant that I wouldn\u2019t be around much.

You knew that was part of the deal.\u201d\n        \"Yeah, and I\u2019ve been raising these kids alone ever since! I have taken them on \u2018family\u2019 vacations; I have attended all of their concerts, awards ceremonies, and sporting events. This is our child\u2019s high school graduation, Dylan.\u201d \n        \u201cGet a grip, Penelope. You know this is important to me. I\u2019ve been with this firm since I graduated from college. I was the youngest partner there! I can\u2019t lose that momentum if I want to make senior partner this year.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Are you going to miss their college graduations? What about their weddings? Are you going to be there when our kids start having kids of their own? How long do I have to wait until you are a present and involved person in my life and in their lives?\u201d\n        Dylan rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going back to my office. If Delilah drops off the papers, just leave them on the table.\u201d\n        \u201cYou need to get your priorities in order before you lose everything!\u201d Penelope shouted at his retreating back. Dylan didn\u2019t acknowledge that he heard her; he just went back into his office and shut the door behind him. \n        When the kids arrived home from school that afternoon, Penelope debated not telling Cassie that her dad would be absent (yet again) from a major event in her life. She had always been the one to break the news, and it never got any easier. She should make Dylan tell her. But, knowing her daughter, Cassie would just tell Dylan it was okay and that she understood, and Dylan would get to walk away feeling justified in his decisions, like always. But Penelope knew it wasn\u2019t okay. She knew that Cassie and Jake noticed their father\u2019s absence from every baseball game and piano concert, and she knew that Cassie would feel this absence too. She sighed and knocked on her daughter\u2019s bedroom door. \n        \u201cYeah?\u201d Cassie responded. \n        Penelope slipped the door open a crack. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d she asked. \n        \u201cOf course,\u201d Cassie replied. She was sitting at her desk, her AP Physics textbook open next to the notebook she was scribbling furiously in. \n        \u201cCan you put the homework away for a minute?\u201d Penelope asked. \n        Cassie looked up at her, her expression a mixture of curiosity and worry.\n        Penelope took a deep breath. \u201cYour dad has to go out of town next week,\u201d she said carefully. She watched as Cassie\u2019s expression changed, realizing the impact of what her mom was saying. \n        \u201cYou mean he\u2019s going to miss my graduation,\u201d she finally said. \n        Penelope nodded. She patted the bed beside her, and Cassie came over and sat down. She put her head on her mom\u2019s shoulder. Penelope stroked Cassie\u2019s hair as they sat there silently. Finally, Cassie lifted her head, and Penelope saw that her face was streaked with tears. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. You\u2019ll be there. You\u2019re always there.\u201d Cassie wiped her face and stood up. \u201cCan I get back to my science homework?\u201d \n        Penelope nodded and slipped out of the room. As she walked away from her daughter\u2019s bedroom, her anger grew. How could Dylan miss her graduation? It was unfathomable. It was appalling. It was unforgivable.\n        Penelope strode into Dylan\u2019s office, not bothering to knock. \n        \u201cPen, I\u2019m on a conference call. Can this wait?\u201d Dylan said irritably. \n        \u201cIt most certainly cannot wait. We have to talk. Now.\u201d \n        Dylan excused himself from the call, turning to stare at Penelope, his arms crossed over his chest. \n        \u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \n        \u201cCancel the trip next week,\u201d she said. \n        Dylan pressed his lips together, frowning. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had this discussion, Penelope. I\u2019m going to San Bernardino. I will take Cassie out to celebrate when I get back.\u201d \n        \u201cNo. You will be here for this milestone in your daughter\u2019s life.\u201d\n        \u201cNo, I won\u2019t. Now, I need to get back to the call,\u201d Dylan said, turning around and picking up his cell phone. \n        \u201cThen get out,\u201d Penelope said, her voice low and threatening. \n        Dylan spun back around. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \n        \u201cYou heard me. These kids are more important than your job, and I will not have you choose your career over them. Not one more time. So, if you insist on taking that trip, then you need to move out. Go to a hotel, go to your brother\u2019s, I don\u2019t care. But get out of this house.\u201d \n        \u201cI paid for this house with that career you hate so much,\u201d Dylan retorted, standing to face Penelope.\n        Penelope kept her voice low and even. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about any of it. Our kids deserve to come first. If you can\u2019t do that, then leave. Now.\u201d She turned and exited the office. \n        Penelope grabbed her keys off the hook by the door and called up the stairs. \u201cJake, Cassie, I\u2019m going to get froyo. If you want to come, I\u2019m leaving in two minutes!\u201d \n        When they returned from FrostBite, Dylan\u2019s car wasn\u2019t in the garage, and his suitcase wasn\u2019t in the closet. Penelope sighed. She had hoped that Dylan would make a different decision, but she had feared that he would choose poorly. She sat down on the bed and dropped her head into her hands, sobbing. Penelope didn\u2019t understand who he had become. She didn\u2019t know how they had turned into this, whatever this was. She cried for several minutes before taking a deep breath, wiping the tears from her cheeks, and putting on a brave face for Cassie and Jake. \n        Penelope told the kids that their dad had an impromptu work trip that called him away. She wasn\u2019t ready to discuss the situation with them until she knew what the situation was. Was Dylan prepared to divorce her over this? Was he okay with losing his wife, kids, and home? She had thought not, but now she wasn\u2019t so sure. She knew he valued his career, but she never really thought he valued it more than the three of them. \n        Over the course of the next week, life went as usual. They were used to Dylan being gone for work, so things around the house didn\u2019t really feel all that different. But, Penelope felt different. She knew that Dylan had become singularly focused over the last twenty years, but he was still the man she had fallen in love with during their sophomore year of college. She tossed and turned at night, missing his presence. It felt different. When he was gone on business, Penelope always knew it was temporary, so she relished the empty bed and extra space. But, knowing that Dylan might be gone forever, the extra space no longer felt like a luxury.\n        Finally, too soon as far as Penelope was concerned, it was the night of Cassie\u2019s graduation dinner. They had invited a few family members and a small group of Cassie\u2019s friends to a local Mexican restaurant the Friday before graduation. Cassie would have a bigger party with more friends and family after graduation, but this was an intimate gathering with just their closest people. \n        \u201cCassie! Jake! We need to leave soon! The reservation is at seven!\u201d Penelope called from her bathroom, where she was putting the final touches on her outfit. She heard her bedroom door open and assumed it was Cassie, coming to borrow a necklace or some perfume. When she turned around, she was surprised to see her husband standing in their bedroom doorway. \n        \u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were in San Bernardino.\u201d \n        Dylan walked over and clasped her hands in his. He dropped to his knees and kissed her hands, tears falling down his cheeks. \n        \u201cPenny, I am so sorry. I have been an absolutely terrible husband and father. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t kick me out sooner,\u201d he sobbed. Penelope reached down, pulling him to his feet. She led him over to the bench at the foot of their bed and sat down with him. \n        Dylan looked at her with tear-soaked eyes, squeezing her hands. \u201cI have just been so focused on work and becoming senior partner. I lost track of everything. And you were so good with the kids, I never felt like they were missing out on anything. But this past week has been dreadful. Sleeping alone, not being able to laugh with you, not being able to call you when I was feeling frustrated or lonely. I went to San Bernardino, and all I could do the entire time was think about you and the kids and wonder what you were doing. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. So, I canceled my last meeting, took an earlier flight home, and resigned from the firm.\u201d\n        Penelope gasped. \u201cYou\u2026quit your job?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy would you quit? Doesn\u2019t that seem\u2026 I don\u2019t know, drastic?\u201d \n        Dylan sighed. \u201cMcDougal, Smith, and Preston wouldn\u2019t agree to cutting back my hours. I tried to stay on there and just make adjustments, but the senior partners wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d \n        He took Penelope\u2019s hands in his own. \u201cI\u2019ve been a lawyer for eighteen years, and I\u2019m a good one. I\u2019ll find a new job. But, I won\u2019t accept any position unless they agree that I don\u2019t work more than forty-five hours a week and I won\u2019t travel more than four days a month. I needed to make this change, Penny, so I could be present for you and the kids. I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t been.\u201d\n        Penelope couldn\u2019t believe her ears. She was almost mad at herself for not giving him this ultimatum a decade earlier. But, none of that mattered now. Dylan had seen that she was serious, and he was going to make an effort to change. Tears slipped from her eyes as she embraced her husband. \n        As they sat in the restaurant that night, Dylan sandwiched between Cassie and Jake, Penelope couldn\u2019t help but watch her husband interact with their kids. He cracked silly jokes that made Cassie groan, and he asked Jake questions about his varsity baseball tryouts the previous spring. The conversation was stilted and a little awkward, but she could see the effort that he was making, and it pleased her. Penelope knew it was possible that he could fall back into his workaholic ways, but she was hopeful that he really had turned over a new leaf and was going to dedicate himself to his family from now on."}

The ending should not be happy.","targets":"        The cold wind pierced Robert\u2019s exposed skin like hundreds of bee stings. Sprawled on his stomach on the solid, frozen ground, he felt chilled to his core. The light from the sun reflected off the endless stretch of ice. He struggled to open his eyes in the glare. \n        Robert sat up and tried to regain his bearings. Although he was still foggy from the leap, he knew he must hasten to find shelter from the relentless cold. \n        \u201cHow could I be so ill prepared?\u201d he berated himself aloud.\n        The most he had ever traveled in time was forward seven months. He couldn\u2019t control the date and time of his destination, but surely he had not time-jumped beyond civilization. Robert stood up and steadied himself on the ice. He looked around at the vast white wilderness and shook his head. This was the moment. The moment he acted out in his backyard as a child. The moment he had given up sleep to study entanglement and wormholes for. The moment for which he had sacrificed everything. He always imagined more pomp and circumstance and less uncertainty.\n        Robert tightened the hood of his sweatshirt over his head and pulled his hands into his sleeves. With no buildings in sight, he decided his best bet was to walk along the nearby riverbed to find a crevice or overhang that could provide shelter. The ground was hard and slick with a light dusting of snow. Sediment and rocks frozen on the surface helped provide some traction. A large dark mass appeared in the distance. As he neared the enormous object, the stench of rotten meat with the slightest note of sweetness grew stronger. \n        \u201cNo, no. It can\u2019t be.\u201d Robert audibly gasped. \n       Before him lay the ravaged carcass of a young wooly mammoth. Thoughts began to race and Robert grew dizzy. He fell to his knees before the massive tusks and began to dry heave. A combination of the putrid smell and the realization that he had actually traveled twenty thousand years into the past overwhelmed his mind and body. What had he gotten himself into? \n       Survival kicked in. He felt in his pocket for the hunting knife his grandfather gave him when he was a child. It had only ever been used to cut string or open packages. It had never been used on an actual animal. As rancid as the beast was, the fur would provide some protection from the biting cold. The skin was already a bit loose, and he cut through the ligaments to remove the pelt. He wrapped one piece around and felt immediate relief. He took another large piece to provide protection later. \n       Time travel took a huge toll on the body as it required a massive amount of energy. Pure adrenaline pushed Robert at this point. He must find shelter soon so that he could set up camp before sunset. There appeared to be a crevice in the rock beneath an overhang in the river bed. It was small but gave Robert enough room to stretch out. Not that he wanted to. All he wanted to do now was curl up under the pelt. He used large rocks to hold the second hide in place as a curtain in front of the opening. \n       He ventured only a few feet from his camp to gather branches from a fallen tree. A fire was critical, not only for warmth. It would hopefully keep away whatever had attacked that mammoth. He piled some wood near the crevice opening. He arranged some small sticks for tinder. Though he never got his fire making badge as a boy scout, he did use his glasses to burn ants when he was a child. Always playing God. What a fine mess that landed him in now. \n        He shivered from the cold but held his hand as steady as he could. The sun focused a beam of light on the tinder. A small trail of smoke appeared, and he blew on the glowing embers. Flames ignited, and Robert sobbed. He understood the exaltation the first human to discover fire must have felt.\n       The adrenaline was wearing off and reality began to set in. He sat in the shelter, hunched over with his arms wrapped around his legs. He stroked the wooly mammoth fur. When he had dreamed of time travel, he imagined watching the pyramids being built or leaping forward to see flying cars. Exhaustion finally overtook Robert, and he drifted off to sleep. \n       The fire had begun to smolder. Roberts' eyes popped open. Disoriented, he sat up, desperately searching for clues. Although he was completely surrounded by the blackness of night, the chill that ran through him reminded him of his reality. Outside the shelter, he heard a clicking on the ice. It stopped for a minute. Then it happened again. \n        A little louder and a little closer. Another pause. More tapping. The curtain moved and a sliver of moonlight shone through the opening. The light bounced off a long sharp fang, and Robert felt a hot breath on his arm. The creature let out a low growl. \n        Robert closed his eyes tightly and prepared for the final leap into the unknown."}

As much as he loved his folks, he was dying to get out of his childhood suburban home and start his \u201creal life.\u201d But every time he was close to finding a reasonable place that wouldn\u2019t require him to sell any organs to make rent, something went wrong.\n        There was the loft with the good lighting, but an hour before he was supposed to sign the lease, the landlord texted him that it had already been rented to someone else. The overpriced studio looked charming on the website, but when he went for a tour, a mouse ran out of the kitchen and into a hole in the wall. So, he was delighted when he found a tidy one-bedroom that was within his budget. The location was great, and it even had an in-unit washer and dryer. \n        While moving in, Dave met his new neighbor in the hallway. He was one of the oldest people Dave had ever seen. The bags around the old man\u2019s eyes looked so heavy that he had a hard time looking at them. But the man had a surprisingly booming voice and a big smile that showed off his very white dentures. \n        \u201cYou must be the new tenant. That\u2019s Betsy\u2019s old place,\u201d the old man said, shaking Dave\u2019s hand.\n        The neighbor introduced himself as Harry. They had a casual chat about the building, and Dave learned that his apartment had been previously occupied by Betsy, a friendly old lady who'd lived there for decades. Everyone in the building had loved Betsy. \n        Then, Harry casually let it slip that Betsy had died in the apartment about a year ago, and that the landlord had been having a difficult time finding anyone to rent the place for more than a few months.\n        \u201cBut this apartment is such a steal. Why couldn\u2019t they find renters?\u201d Dave asked.\n        \u201cIt is because Betsy keeps showing up and scaring people,\u201d Harry replied, smiling with a teasing look in his eye.\n        \u201cSo the apartment is haunted?\u201d Dave asked skeptically.\n        \u201cJust by Betsy. She is a sweet old bird. Don\u2019t let her bother you.\u201d\n        Dave had always been a skeptic when it came to the supernatural. He laughed off this strange encounter and continued to unpack.\n        That first night, he was awakened by the sound of water running in the kitchen. He went in and found the kitchen tap on. He made a mental note to talk to his landlord about the plumbing the next day. However, an hour later, he woke up again. This time, he heard the distinct sounds of footsteps walking down his hall. He jumped out of bed and started creeping back towards the kitchen, but was startled by a loud beep. He turned around and noticed that his washing machine had suddenly been turned on. \n        A cold drop of sweat dripped down his back as he searched around the rest of the apartment. He found his clothes spinning in his new washing machine and tried to calm his nerves.\n        For the next week, he kept waking up in the middle of the night to strange noises. A few nights later, he heard the gas on the stove top clicking. He raced to the kitchen and turned off the burner in a panic.\n        Breaking his lease was financially unfeasible. Going back home felt like a failure. He decided that his only option was to stay and attempt to shake off the fear that gripped him.\n        Two weeks later, as he was sitting on his couch watching Thursday Night Football, the channel suddenly changed from the Bears to Wheel Of Fortune.\n        Dave changed the channel back to the game. A few moments later, it switched again.\n        \u201cFine, Betsy! You want to watch your show? I\u2019m leaving!\u201d Dave stormed out of the apartment and went to watch the game at a sports bar a few blocks away.\n        When he got back to his apartment later that night, he gasped as he walked in the door. He had left his apartment in its usual state of casual disarray. There had been a few beer cans on the floor and a scattering of dirty clothes spilling into his hallway. But now, the entire apartment was immaculate. All the dishes were washed and stacked next to the sink. The cans were in the recycling, and, most shockingly, his dryer beeped. All of his dirty clothes were there, clean, ready to be folded.\n        \u201cWow. You didn\u2019t have to do that. Thanks, Betsy!\u201d\n        Over the next month, Dave's spectral roommate proved to be quite helpful. Most mornings when he woke up, she\u2019d already cleaned the dishes, put in a load of laundry, and even wiped the toothpaste out of the sink. Dave had never lived in such a spotless place. His parents had always been on him about tidying up his room, but he\u2019d let himself develop some pretty messy habits. \n        Ever since the night of the Bears\u2019 game, Dave had stopped fearing Betsy and had actually begun to appreciate her. But then Betsy started overstepping a bit. A few weeks before Christmas, Dave woke up and found that she\u2019d decorated the apartment by hanging an old-fashioned garland around the front door. A few days later, he realized that one of his pictures of the 2013 Blackhawks team had been replaced with a watercolor landscape painting. \n        \u201cWhere are you getting this stuff from?\u201d Dave asked Betsy. She responded by opening the closet door. When he looked in the closet, he saw that there was a small storage bin that he\u2019d never seen before. It was full of knickknacks.\n        The next day, he woke early. His blackout blind had been replaced with vintage lace curtains. When he went to brush his teeth, he found a miniature porcelain figure of Elvis Presley on his bathroom shelf next to his mouthwash. A few days later, his standard glass salt and pepper shakers were missing, and in their place was a Mickey and Minnie Mouse set. \n        It all happened so slowly that Dave hardly even noticed, but bit by bit, over the next year, the sloppy bachelor pad he had haphazardly decorated transformed into the kitschy, homey, well-lived apartment of an elderly woman.\n        Most nights, Dave and Betsy would watch Wheel of Fortune together. He avoided bringing people back to his place, partly because he was embarrassed about his home decor and partly to avoid upsetting Betsy. Before he knew it, his one-year lease was up. If he wanted to, he could be free from all of this. He was a young single man living on his own in a cool city. He didn\u2019t need to live with an invisible, dead woman. But looking around the apartment at the cozy world that Betsy had made her own, he felt that he was home."}

I just don\u2019t, but it still happened to me.\n        It\u2019s the job that led me to settle in New Orleans, and every house, indeed every building in the city that stood through the hurricane has a story. They\u2019re all just stories, right? But there\u2019s a heaviness to certain places, even a party destination like NOLA. I can\u2019t explain it, and no, I still don\u2019t believe it, even though it happened to me.\n        \u201cThis one has a basement. That\u2019s rare around here, but the Garden District is on a bit of a bluff, so nothing flooded too badly with Katrina. It\u2019s been resealed several times since then with no leakage,\u201d the real estate agent said. \n        \u201cNot bad.\u201d I looked around the kitchen. \"The counters needed replacing, and this old intercom panel needs to be taken out, but otherwise it looks okay.\u201d I pointed towards a door next to the pantry. \u201cDoes that go to the basement?\u201d\n        \u201cYes. It\u2019s completely finished and adds another five hundred feet of floor space.\u201d Clyde, the real estate agent, wore a dark green polo shirt and nondescript khaki pants. He opened the door to the basement and gestured for me to enter. \u201cI\u2019ll let you explore.\u201d\n        I hit the light at the top of the stairs and ventured down, careful to keep my hand on the rail. The steps felt pretty solid for basement stairs and creaked only a little. I clicked the second light switch on a panel when I reached the bottom. A weak light illuminated the main basement room, a bare space with a utility sink and a concrete floor. Two other doors led to other rooms. One hung wide open and appeared to be a workshop. I ventured inside to find a workbench and shelves lining one wall. A couple of metal shelving units stood against the opposite wall, housing only a couple of small jars of screws and nails.\n        The other door off the main basement room was cracked. I crossed the space and moved to push the door open. It swung open. The room appeared empty, just more concrete floors and bare walls. An old intercom panel jutted slightly out of the wall next to the light switch. I moved to cross the threshold, and it felt as if I was being pushed away. Again, I attempted to enter, but it felt almost like a hand pressed against my chest, keeping me out of the room. My breath caught, but more out of surprise than fear.\n        I tried again, and I almost felt a rebound effect, like I was pushed backwards. I felt a cold wave pass through my body, and the hair stood up on my arms.\n        \u201cHey,\u201d I called up the stairs to Clyde, \u201cis there some kind of heating problem down here? I just got a chill.\u201d\n        The agent cleared his throat, almost a nervous sound. \u201cUhh, I believe everything is in working order, but we can add an HVAC allowance if you want to make an offer.\u201d\n        The normalcy of his words reassured me momentarily, and I moved to enter the room again, and this time I pushed past the weird shoving sensation and entered the room. The space itself appeared just like the rest of the basement, an empty room with recently painted off-white walls and a concrete floor. \n        That\u2019s when I heard it. \n        No, I mean, no. I heard nothing because I don\u2019t believe in supernatural nonsense. But I heard it all the same.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here all alone. Please don\u2019t leave.\u201d A faint, small voice, possibly a child. As soon as I heard it, I questioned whether I had heard anything at all. It came out of nowhere and was just as suddenly gone.\n        I exited the room and walked up the stairs calmly, as if nothing had happened.\n        Clyde looked a little overly enthusiastic about selling me the place. \u201cSo, what\u2019d ya think? Do you want to make an offer?\u201d\n        \u201cLet\u2019s keep looking. This place is a \u2018no\u2019 for me.\u201d \n        That\u2019s when I heard it again, faintly. \u201cStay with me.\u201d It was like a whisper in the walls. I couldn\u2019t tell if Clyde heard it or not. If he did, he didn\u2019t acknowledge it. After that, I was more than happy to leave the house.\n        Outside, the light of the late afternoon of the dreary October day had started to fade, and I reconsidered the prospect of looking at more houses.\n        \u201cSorry, I do want to keep looking at places, but it\u2019s probably better if we get a fresh start tomorrow. Do you have more places to show me?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got lots. You sure you\u2019re not interested in this house?\u201d He seemed eager, which made me even less interested in the place. I felt the same chill as I had in the basement, but I was outside now, so I thought little of the shivery cold that passed through my body.\n        I felt it again when I got in my car, so I readjusted my scarf and tucked it into the collar of my jacket.\n        Back at my hotel, one of those extended-stay places near downtown, I took off my shoes and jacket and settled down to watch some news and check my phone for messages. \n        One of my texts came from \u201cUnknown Number\u201d and said, \u201cThanks for taking me with you. They never let me go out.\u201d\n        I shuddered. No, it couldn\u2019t be. I responded simply, \u201cSorry, wrong number.\u201d\n        My heart jolted when the three dots appeared on my screen, indicating that someone was typing a message.\n        \u201cI\u2019m here. You brought me with you. Thanks. They never let me go anywhere.\u201d\n        Someone was obviously messing with me. I tapped annoyedly into my phone, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n        The unknown messenger responded again. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Millie. Can we go to the movies? I want to see the one about the girl from Kansas who goes to the place with the wizard!\u201d\n        I tapped at the screen again and said, \u201cOkay, whoever this is can stop now. Is this some kind of joke?\u201d\n        The dots appeared again, and the words \u201cNo. Let\u2019s go to the cinema. Please?\u201d\n        I turned off my messaging app\u2014all of my messaging apps, as a matter of fact, but the word \u201cplease\u201d showed up on my screen, repeated in three separate messages. I turned off notifications.\n        The next day, before meeting Clyde again, I went to a phone store and showed them my messages, which now included ten unread messages from the same unknown caller. The phone company rep was baffled. \u201cThere\u2019s no number for the other party. I can\u2019t trace it, not even an IP address. They must be using some really sophisticated spoofing software.\u201d\n        I called Clyde to ask where we\u2019d be meeting to start our day of real estate viewings, and I had to ask.\n        \u201cSo this is going to sound weird, but is there something strange about that last house we looked at yesterday? Something about a kid, maybe?\u201d\n        Clyde let out an audible sigh over the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll level with you. That place has been in my inventory for a year. My sales record is great, but you\u2019re right. The place is strange. Nobody comes up out of that basement wanting to buy the house.\u201d\n        \u201cI certainly can understand that. What do you know about the room downstairs\u2014not the workshop, the other one?\u201d I felt the chill pass through me again.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s nothing in there. Nobody goes in it. They all say it\u2019s cold, kinda like you did. The disclosure only goes back fifty years, but I heard that the daughter of the original owners had some kind of immune thing. They couldn\u2019t touch her. Just brought her newspapers, books, and food. She died young, I think. She used the intercom to communicate with the family a lot, later the phone too.\u201d\n        But I went into the room. Everything in me told me not to go in there, but I pushed past it and went in anyway. The next day, I tried getting a new phone, even a new number, but Millie had gotten into the cloud, I guess.\n        No, I don\u2019t believe any of this. I felt ridiculous when I went back to my hotel on my last night in New Orleans and set up my phone with the camera facing the TV. Even more ridiculous when I pulled up the movie about the green wizard and the girl from Kansas and let it play. For her.\n        As the credits rolled, my phone messages went active again. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve always wanted to see it. My brother told me all about it, but I never got to.

It was the only light for miles on the stretch of Texas Highway 118 between Terlingua and Alpine. The siren released a short blast, startling Maria and Luna.\n        \u201cCrap! I was only going five miles over the limit,\u201d Maria said as she pulled over to the dusty shoulder of the highway. She turned off the engine and fumbled through the glove compartment for her registration and insurance. \n        Luna laughed. \u201cMy speeding ticket doesn\u2019t look so bad now.\u201d Maria shot a glance to her seventeen year-old daughter. Luna quieted down. \n        The spotlight from the cruiser illuminated Maria\u2019s car. She looked in the rearview mirror and saw the dark silhouette of the trooper walking towards them. Maria rolled down her window, and the trooper shone his flashlight into the car. Maria and Luna squinted, taking a moment for their eyes to adjust to the light. \n        The officer tipped his cowboy hat. \u201cLicense and registration.\u201d\n        He seemed to stare past Maria and Luna with dead, black eyes. His face and hands were alarmingly smooth and almost translucent. Though you might expect to see the blue lines of veins, there was a complete absence of color. His paleness was shocking, especially for someone that worked out in the West Texas sun. \n        \u201cWh- why are you pulling me over?\u201d Maria asked as she handed the documentation to the trooper. Her finger brushed against his freezing cold hand. The chill was so intense that it felt almost electric. It sent a shiver down her spine. \n        The trooper remained silent as he examined her license. He looked back up at Maria. \u201cPlease step out of the car.\u201d\n        \u201cI- i- is there s-something wrong?\u201d Maria asked as she obeyed the officer\u2019s orders. \n        He motioned with his hand for Maria to follow him to his cruiser. She looked back at Luna, mouth agape, in the passenger seat. \u201cMom,\u201d she said, tears filling her eyes.\n        \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, mija, Just stay put\u201d Maria said, putting on a front of calmness to assure her daughter. Inside, her stomach tied in knots. Her brain screamed at her to jump back in the car and speed away. However, she ignored this primal warning.\n        Without the spotlight shining in the mirror, Maria could make out the trooper\u2019s car. It was an older model sedan that looked like a boat, not one of the newer SUVs that patrolled the highways now. He opened the backdoor of the cruiser and motioned for her to get in. \n        Maria looked back at her car. Luna peered over the seat. She could see her talking on her phone and gesturing wildly. Maria turned back to the trooper. \u201cLook, I just want to know what I did wrong? I\u2019ve never broken the law, not even littered. Please, let me check on my daughter,\u201d she pleaded.\n        Her voice cracked. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n        The officer was unmoved and stood emotionless as he gestured again to the back seat. Defeated, she took a deep breath and composed herself.\n        Her leg bounced with nervous energy as she watched the officer in the front seat. He flipped through her insurance and registration. The noise of the police scanner broke the silence, and Maria jumped. The trooper pulled out a notepad and pen and began to write something. Maria stretched her neck to try to see what he was doing. \n        Once he finished writing, he sat for a minute. It felt like an hour to Maria. He stepped out of the car and opened the back door. \n        He motioned for Maria to exit. Shaking, she stood up. He ripped the paper from the notepad and handed it to her. She took the paper with a trembling hand. Before she could read it, the trooper got back in his vehicle and took off. She watched the taillights as the cruiser sped off. They looked like they disappeared into nothingness. \n        Maria ran back to her car. Luna burst into tears, and her mother hugged her tightly. Once calmed down, they sat for a moment, trying to process what just happened. Luna sniffed, and Maria turned on the interior light so that she could read the paper the trooper had given her. \n        She tilted her head. \u201c A ticket for a broken taillight?\u201d\n        Maria got out of the car and walked to the back. Both taillights were in perfect, working condition. She got back in the car. The cruise control was set to five miles under the speed limit, and they drove in stunned silence the rest of the way home.\n        The next morning, Maria called the Brewster County DPS office.\n        \u201cHmm. I don\u2019t see it in the system. Can you read the ticket number to me again?\u201d asked the man on the other line. \n        \u201cSure,\u201d said Maria. \"The handwriting is kinda hard to read.\"\n        \u201cHandwriting?\u201d He asked. \u201cBut we use computers for our tickets now.\u201d\n        \"Yes, sir,\" Maria replied. \u201cIt\u2019s handwritten.\u201d\n        The man let out a hearty laugh. \u201cIs the ticket for a broken taillight?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, sir. It is,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cSergeant Allen\u2019s at it again!\u201d He laughed once more.\n        \u201cUmm, yeah, that\u2019s the name on the ticket. What do I need to do?\u201d\n        \u201cYou can disregard it,\u201d the man said. \u201cSergeant Allen died in the line of duty ten years ago. Doesn\u2019t seem to know he can rest now.

He knew he should be tired of these songs after listening to them nearly nonstop for the past eleven months, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to listen to anything else.\n        While the playlist restarted with Ed Sheeran crooning \u201cWhen your legs don't work like they used to before\u201d, Brady reached for his phone and began his ritual of scrolling through his photo album simply titled \u201cV.\u201d He clicked on a video of them from last Halloween. \n        In it, Victoria, dressed as a zombie bride and grinning, says, \u201cWould you want me as your bride, even if I was gonna eat your brains?\u201d \n        Brady, from off-screen, replies, \u201cI would want you as my bride in whatever form you come, babe.\u201d \n        He dropped the phone onto the coffee table, suddenly unable to stop the sobs that were ripped from his chest. His crying was interrupted by a pounding at the door. He didn\u2019t need to get up to know it would be his neighbor-and-best-friend, Colin. He heard the spare key turn in the lock, but he couldn\u2019t muster the energy to wipe the tears from his face or turn the playlist off.\n        \u201cDude, come on. It\u2019s Monday. You have to go to work,\u201d Colin said, hauling Brady up by the arms. \n        Colin looked around the apartment, wrinkling his nose. \u201cDid you sleep on the couch again? I thought you said you were going to try to move back to your bedroom this weekend.\u201d \n        Brady burst into tears again. \u201cI tried. I can\u2019t, Col. The bed still smells like her.\u201d \n        Colin patted his friend on the back. \u201cDude, and I say this with all the love in the world, there is no way you can smell Victoria anywhere in this apartment. It smells like... old takeout and body odor.\u201d\n        Brady shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, dude. Cori never left you.\u201d \n        Colin snorted. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve never had my heart broken? I can assure you I have. You know what I haven\u2019t done, though? Let that heartbreak define me and ruin my life.\u201d He gave his friend a gentle shove toward the bathroom. \u201cNow, get dressed and brush your teeth. I\u2019ll wait and walk down with you.\u201d\n        After work that night, Brady reluctantly agreed to grab dinner with Colin and his girlfriend at the local pizza place. Throughout the entire meal, Brady nodded at their stories and gave vague, generic answers to their questions. While they talked, he let his mind drift to the dozens of times he and Victoria had eaten in this same restaurant, in this same booth. Brady knew Colin didn\u2019t bring him here specifically to torture him; if they avoided all the places that reminded him of Victoria, Brady would never go anywhere but work. Even home wasn\u2019t safe. \n        When he had reached his limit of pretending to be okay, he thanked them for dinner and bolted for his apartment. Safely inside and alone once again, Brady turned on the playlist and sang along as Christina Perri promised to love him for a thousand years.\n        While he listened to the love songs of The Beatles, Michael Bubl\u00e9, and Taylor Swift, Brady scrolled through Victoria\u2019s various social media accounts. She had personal ones that he was blocked from viewing, but she couldn\u2019t make her business pages private, so he used those to check on her. He looked through images of the wedding and graduation that she had photographed the previous weekend, picturing her in her unofficial uniform of black overalls and a black felt boater, her camera slung around her neck by the pink-and-green personalized strap Brady had gifted her the first Christmas they were together.\n        The following day was a Tuesday, and Brady did what he had done every Tuesday for the last three years. He went to Elevate, the restaurant where Victoria was a part-time bartender. Her dream, Brady knew, was to make photography her full-time gig, but until that was feasible, she had to tend bar to make ends meet. When they were dating, Brady would sit at the bar and keep her company during her shift. But ever since their breakup, Brady didn\u2019t go inside. He just glimpsed her through the window and then walked home.\n        When they had first broken up, Victoria had been gentle and understanding about Brady\u2019s inability to move on. But, nearly a year later, her patience was growing thin. Brady was pretty sure she had blocked his phone number months ago, but he still texted her pictures and memories from their time together. \n        In the beginning, Brady had made efforts. He deleted Victoria\u2019s phone number, removed her from his social media accounts, and set up an online dating profile. But, after months of trying, he had given up and gave himself permission to wallow and sink into his despair.\n        Several months after their breakup, Brady had sent her a bouquet with sixteen yellow roses (her favorite), one for every month they had spent together. He had come home from work to find those same roses dumped on his welcome mat. He didn\u2019t send her any more gifts after that. \n        The following weekend, after days of listening to their playlist and scrolling through their photos together, there was a knock at his door. Brady rolled over on the couch, covering his face with the pillow. He had been up way too late, watching Victoria\u2019s favorite movies, and he was exhausted. \n        \u201cCome back later!\u201d he yelled, his voice thick with sleep. He heard the key turning in the lock. He never should\u2019ve given Colin that blasted key. \n        \u201cCome on. Cori and I are going to the outlets to look for Thanksgiving decor. Come with us,\u201d Colin said. \n        Brady sat up, pulling the blanket tightly around his shoulders. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said. \n        Colin rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat are your plans for today?\u201d \n        \u201cWell, I was going to think about Victoria, and then cry about Victoria, and then maybe call Victoria and beg for her to take me back.\u201d Brady smiled wryly at his friend. He knew he was being impossible, but why did Colin insist on going through this routine every weekend?\n        There was another knock at the door, this one gentler. Brady knew it would be Cori coming to help convince Brady to join them. \n        Brady sighed. He had to go to his dad and stepmom\u2019s house the following week for Thanksgiving, so maybe he should join them and look for a hostess gift for his stepmom.\n        \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll go with you. Let me get changed,\u201d Brady said, standing up from the couch. While he was in the bathroom, Colin and Cori scooped up his bedding and dirty clothes from the floor, tossing them into the hamper. Colin cleared the empty beer bottles and takeout containers from the coffee table, while Cori wiped down the counters and loaded the dishwasher. When Brady emerged, his apartment looked somewhat livable again. \n        \u201cYou guys, you know I can take care of myself,\u201d he groaned, mostly from his own embarrassment at being cleaned up after. \n        \u201cWe know, Brady,\u201d Cori said gently. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to support you.\u201d\n        \u201cYou know,\u201d Colin said, looking around, \u201cyou\u2019d probably feel more comfortable here if you got rid of all the reminders of her.\u201d He picked a photo off the shelf. \u201cMaybe pack a few of these away?\u201d \n        Brady snatched the picture out of his hands. \u201cCut it out,\u201d he said sharply, holding the picture to his chest. \n        Colin put his hands up in defense. \u201cSorry, man. I\u2019m just saying, get rid of the throw pillows and the photos, put some different art on the walls\u2026\u201d \n        \u201cI\u2019ll redecorate when I feel like it,\u201d Brady said, placing the framed photo back on the shelf. \n        \u201cMaybe you could start by changing your relationship status to \u2018single.\u2019 Your social media accounts all say \u2018in a relationship\u2019 still, Colin suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ve been broken up for a year, dude.\u201d \n        \u201cIt\u2019s been eleven months,\u201d Brady said, frowning. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Cori gave Colin a look that said he\u2019d pushed enough, and Colin nodded in agreement. \n        When they returned from the outlets, Brady with a pumpkin-shaped serving dish and a box of leftovers, he thanked Colin for inviting him. \n        \u201cI\u2019m going to work on getting over Victoria,\u201d he promised them as he shut the door. \n        Once he was alone again, he slumped down to the floor, tears spilling down his cheeks. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. He had just spent the day with two of his favorite people, shopping and enjoying a delicious lunch at The Tavern, but all he could think about was how much better the day would\u2019ve been with Victoria there. She would\u2019ve loved the quirky tsotchke shop, Bits \u2018n Pieces. And she would\u2019ve shared the chicken pot pie with him at lunch, so he didn\u2019t have to bring half of it home and eat it, sad and alone, in his sweatpants. \n        Brady got up on his own on Monday and got ready for work without Colin\u2019s persistent nagging. He even managed to take a shower, which he hadn\u2019t done in an embarrassingly long time. Proud of himself, he stopped at the local donut shop for a cruller and a latte. He walked into work feeling more himself than he had in quite a while. \n        As he waited for the elevator, he hummed a song he had heard on the radio driving in. He had surprised himself by not putting on their playlist this morning, and he felt like maybe he was finally seeing an end to his misery.\n        When he got to his desk, there was a sticky note on his monitor that said \u201cMcKinley\u2019s office when you arrive.\u201d Mr. McKinley was the head of Brady\u2019s IT department and Brady\u2019s boss. He set his coffee down next to his computer and headed down the hall. \n        He knocked hesitantly on his boss\u2019 door. \n        \u201cCome in,\u201d his boss said gruffly. \n        Brady entered the office, shutting the door behind him. McKinley gestured toward the chair across from him. \n        \u201cBrady. You\u2019ve been on thin ice for a while now,\u201d McKinley said, looking at him directly. \u201cFor the past three quarters, you\u2019ve been showing up late, missing deadlines, and not focusing on your job.\u201d \n        Brady gulped, nodding. \"Yes, sir,\u201d he said. \n        \u201cThis is your last chance,\u201d McKinley said, sliding a performance improvement plan across the desk to him. Brady picked it up, reading the valid and accurate accusations against him.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid,\u201d McKinley said, sighing and folding his hands in front of him. \u201cBut we have a business to run here. And if your head\u2019s not in the game, you need to make a change.\u201d\n        Brady felt mute, his stomach muscles clenching as he nodded. \n        \u201cOkay, that\u2019s all. Sign that form by the end of the work day and leave it with my receptionist,\u201d McKinley said, waving his hand to dismiss Brady from his office. \n        Brady collected the paperwork and left McKinley\u2019s office, hurrying to a bathroom stall before breaking down. He knew he had been letting things fall apart this year, but he hadn\u2019t seriously considered the repercussions. If he were fired from this job, he\u2019d have to move back to his mom and stepfather\u2019s house, and that was just not an option. He liked his stepfather just fine, but he was too old to be given a curfew and restrictions. He sat on the toilet seat in the empty bathroom, regulating his breathing. \n        Once he felt more stable, Brady went back to his desk. He signed the form from his boss and then pulled up his email. He was sure that Victoria had blocked his email account ages ago, but he needed to let her know that he was finally going to leave her alone. He created a new, anonymous email address and started writing.\n        Victoria, \n        I promise this will be my last communication with you. I understand how much I have bothered, annoyed, and frustrated you in the past eleven months. I know that I have been difficult. I am going to turn things around. This is not a plea to get you back; it is merely a farewell. Colin will be mailing you a box with some of the things you left at the apartment\u2014keep them, toss them, whatever. I just have to get them out of my apartment. I need to move on from you, and this is the first step. \n        Thank you for being so patient and understanding this past year. I wish you all the best.\n                                                                Sincerely, Brady \n        He hit \u201csend\u201d and then called Colin. \u201cHey, do me a favor? Go into my apartment and remove everything that is Victoria\u2019s. Put it into a box and ship it to her.\u201d Colin agreed happily, and they hung up. \n        Once he had finished those tasks, Brady went into all of his social media accounts to block her personal and business pages, change his relationship status to \u2018single\u2019, and remove all the social media apps from his phone. Once he was done, he went into his music app and deleted the playlist. \n        Brady took a deep breath. He had needed to do those things for nearly a year, and it felt good to accomplish them. He knew he would probably always have a place in his heart for Victoria, but he also knew that their time together was over, and he needed to get on with living his life.\n"}

I was in fact \u201cborne away by the waves.\u201d But, the tale does not end at this moment.\n        My creator, Victor, is dying aboard a frigid ship in the Arctic Ocean, with only me beside him. The crew fled the ship before it wrecked, and Victor was left behind. No one knew that I was hiding in the shadows, watching them as they flee. \n        I emerge from my hiding space to be by his side, during his final moments. Why is Victor in this state, you ask? He was trying to escape me; I followed him. Who else do I have in this cursed life, after all? \n        There is nothing left for me now. The meaning in my life slips away as fast as Victor\u2019s existence drains from his pale body. I am haunted by the darkness in my mind. Images of what I have done, and who I am, pierce the blackness of my thoughts like lightning in a violent storm. I am a monster. It haunts me that my creator will die from an illness borne from the freezing cold, as he was trying to flee from me. Abject loneliness, and regret, are my entire existence. So, I sink willingly into the cold bleak emptiness of the Arctic Ocean. \n        As I float through the blackness, spiraling down, my body goes numb, and all that is left of me are my thoughts. I want to be more than a monster, but how is that possible? I am shunned by society and gruesome to behold. Is it even possible for me to be an individual? How is it possible to find oneself, to become an individual, when one is completely alone? I wait for the darkness to overtake me.\n        The deep night falls, but not in the way I expected. It recedes and there is daylight.  I open my eyes, and blink trying to make sense of where I am. The waves crash upon the shore as birds caw in the distance. I am freezing. Sitting up is a great endeavor, but I finally manage it and look around. I am on a rocky beach. To one side of me is a very small village, to the other, a bit further off in the distance, is a lighthouse. \n        There are no people milling about, and all seems quiet. I see laundry hanging in one of the distant yards. Perhaps there is something I can use to warm myself. Trying to stand makes the ground tilt beneath my feet. It takes several minutes before I can steady myself. I know I need to get warm. How crazy this sudden desire to live when just recently, I craved oblivion. \n         My walk is unsteady, but I make it to the yard. I see clothes that look like they might fit me. I quickly grab a shirt, sweater, woolen skirt, knee-high socks, and a blanket off the line. With my loot pressed against my chest, I run inside a nearby shed that has a large wooden door that is slightly ajar.\n        Once inside, I put on the dry clothes. They fit surprisingly well. I slide down against the wall of the shed and cover myself with the coarse woolen blanket. My limbs feel like needles are piercing them, but I am beginning to warm up. My eyes are beginning to flutter, and I take deep breaths to try and keep myself awake. I must stay awake, because it is not safe for me to stay here. Just a few more minutes to warm up.\n        I awake to an ear-piercing scream. I scramble up the wall trying desperately to stand, but I am so discombobulated. I try to speak, but no words come out. A tear runs down my cheek. The woman just stares at me. I know I look hideous. My very appearance inspires terror.\n        \u201cWhat are you doing in my shed?\u201d she demands.\n        \u201cI washed up upon the shore,\u201d I replied.\n        \u201cWere you in a shipwreck?\u201d she asks?\n        I pause before I answer.  A shipwreck, that idea is the light in my darkness. I decide to turn the idea of a disaster into my salvation. I will begin my new life with a lie, perhaps not the most auspicious beginning, but still a foundation. From this moment forward, I am going to be a stranger from a distant land, who was in a shipwreck, and understandably has amnesia. My appearance now, the scars everywhere, are explicable as injuries at sea. I have actual wounds too, it turns out. No one will know the difference in the end. I will look hideous, but they will not know that I am a monster. Hopefully, they will not discover the truth about me at any rate. Life is so uncertain.\n        \u201cYes, a shipwreck,\u201d I reply, \"but, I can\u2019t remember where I am from or where I am supposed to be going.\u201d\n        \u201cYou poor thing, wrecks are common in this area during the winter.\u201d\n        I begin to calm down. After all, she is not chasing me with a pitchfork.         \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry I took your clothes. I was cold and wet. I was afraid to knock on anyone\u2019s door, because well, look at me.\u201d\n        \u201cEveryone has scars,\u201d she said, \u201csome are visible, others are not.\u201d\n        I let out a deep breath. It\u2019s strange that I didn\u2019t notice that I was holding it. Breathing is not as automatic as we are led to believe.\n        \u201cMy name is Beth,\u201d she said, extending her hand to me.\n        I realize in that moment, that I have no name but, monster. A name is required for a new start in life. It\u2019s difficult to pick something so important, individuating, without time to think. I decide to name myself after my creator. I have no better option, and it\u2019s fitting because he will always be a part of my story.\n        \u201cMy name is Frank,\u201d I reply. \u201cFrank Victor Stein.\u201d\n        \u201cWell,\u201d said Beth, \u201cI have stew on the stove. Why don\u2019t you come in for lunch, and we can talk about what to do. I have some ideas. Maybe fate has been kind to both of us on this day, and we can help each other.\u201d\n        It turns out that Beth\u2019s husband is lost at sea. It has been over two months with no word about the ship. She has not lost hope, but she needs help. Beth, you see, has two very young children: a newborn, and a two-year-old. She also sews clothes for people in the village to earn extra money for the family.\n        Her husband runs the lighthouse. It\u2019s how they make their primary living. The cottage she is living in, is paid for by tending to the lighthouse. It\u2019s a good, solid living. They have what they need, especially with her sewing on the side. However, trying to keep the lighthouse going, alone, with two small children, is an almost impossible task for her. \n        The cottage they live in is about two miles from the lighthouse. They live in the cottage to be in the village because Beth likes to be around other people, especially with the children. Two miles is not far until you have to run for a doctor in the pouring rain or snow. Moreover, the lighthouse was really built for one person to live in, possibly two. There is one bedroom, a small library, bathroom, and a tiny kitchen with a table for two. It\u2019s very quaint, but not great for a family. Plus, running up the stairs with two children to light the flame, especially in a storm, can be hazardous, and it\u2019s not always possible to leave them behind. \n        We talk for a long time, and then agree that I will live in the lighthouse, and tend to the duties of lighting the lantern each night, and keep watch for inbound ships during the day. There is a bell to ring if one should come in. I will tend to the grounds, and check the docks to make sure they remain in good order. If something needs repair, I am to let Beth know, and she will get one of the villagers to fix it. \n        For these duties, I will be able to live there, and Beth will bring me food a couple times each week. She has also given me some of her husband\u2019s clothes, in addition to the ones I took. It turns out that I am wearing a kilt. It seems I have much to learn about the ways of society, including the dress code. I can\u2019t help but shake my head, me the monster, wearing a kilt and loving it.\n        The library in the lighthouse is amazing, and Beth agreed to give me reading lessons when she brings me the food. Generations of lighthouse keepers have added to the collection of books over the years, there is much to learn about humanity from these works. Perhaps one day, when I understand the ways of the world more, I will be brave enough to go into the village with Beth. \n        Until then, I will excise the ghosts that haunt my mind by becoming a person, an individual. Maybe a part of me will always be a monster, that was how I was created. But, I now believe I can be more than that. I have Beth, a purpose, and the books.  I am no longer alone. It\u2019s more than I have ever had before. I have a beginning, a new chapter in my life. \n        I look over the sea that almost engulfed me. The clouds look like ghosts from my past. What would Victor think if he could see me now? Would he run away? No, he probably would puff up hubristically, and chortle that he has done it; that he created life that isn\u2019t a monster. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d I hear, echoing in my head. These were the first words I ever heard, but perhaps, the monster is, after all, dead."}

They created an autumnal veil in front of the stone facade of her new home. The small cottage nestled on the edge of a vast forest overlooking a small pond. The rays of the setting sun washed over the surface of the water, setting it ablaze with light. It was a view that Freyja knew she could grow to love. She felt a brief flicker of hope that this could be somewhere that felt like home. Since she left Asgard and the large gilded halls of Sessr\u00famnir, she could not shake her feelings of perpetual displacement. \n        Freyja\u2019s limbs felt like lead, and she wanted nothing more than to simply slump to the ground and sleep. She was exhausted, in a way that a good night\u2019s sleep could never fix. She was tired \u2014 tired of Asgardian politics, tired of being a pawn in Loki\u2019s schemes, tired of begging her husband to stay with her, and tired of being alone. Freyja was bound and determined to escape her old life. The only thing that stood in her way was her responsibility. She was bound to half the souls who died in battle in her grand hall, Sessr\u00famnir. She got the half that didn\u2019t make it to Valhalla, so she suffered for eternity listening to them complain about being stuck with her. They followed her everywhere she went. \n        This time would be different. Freyja was sure the warding spells she cast were strong enough to keep the spirits at bay long enough to hide herself from them. Her two daughters were grown up with their own families; her husband was on another one of his \u201cadventures.\u201d\n        This time, she would not scour this realm and the next crying for him to come back. The memories of countless nights she sobbed her golden tears while searching for her absentee husband all came flooding back to her. Freyja shuddered at the shame of it all \u2014 the goddess of love, war and magic pining after a guy who couldn\u2019t be bothered to stay with his wife and daughters for more than a couple of years at a time. \n        The meows of her two cats pulled her out of the dark, deep well of her memories. With a sigh, Freyja gracefully enchanted all of her possessions and watched as they floated up out of the chariot and piled themselves next to the front door. The metal hinges groaned under the weight of the heavy wooden door as Freyja slowly swung it open. \n        She hesitated for a moment in the threshold, taking in the sight before her. The house was covered in a layer of dust that swirled around her like old memories stirred up. They caught the light and glimmered in the evening sun. She crossed over into her future, struggling to hold back the ghosts of her past. She longed to hear the patter of her daughters\u2019 feet on the hardwood floors and their laughter bouncing off the soft yellow walls. Odr running after them, his own booming laughter harmonizing with theirs. \n        She picked up a bundle of bedding and entered. Freyja dispelled the dust and her lingering loneliness a bit more with every window she threw open. She went from room to room, bringing in her belongings and opening the windows. She worked diligently for hours until everything was moved in, and the brisk night air had swept the house clean of dust and loneliness until all that was left was the faint smell of autumn leaves on the cool night air. \n        Freyja spent the next month making the space her home. She made small repairs to the house, covered the floors in soft warm rugs, planted her herbs in clay pots that lined the windows. Her cats claimed the sunniest spot in the house for their naps. Freyja\u2019s home was always warm from an enchanted fire perpetually crackling in the hearth, but she could not shake the cold grip of isolation; it gnawed on her heart, always. \n        Her kitchen, that morning, was bathed in soft light spilling from windows over the table. Freyja sat at the head of the long, empty table. A hunk of fresh bread sat on a pewter plate in front of her. She sipped on a cup of steaming hot tea that filled the room with a faint smell of lavender, sage and rosemary. \n        Suddenly, Freyja felt a disturbance in her warding spell, which snapped her out of the blank stare she had been giving to her meal. An apparition appeared in the chair across from her, and Freyja knew she had foolishly let her guard down. \n        She heaved a great sigh and looked up at the semi-transparent form of a hulking young man with an ax sprouting out of the top of his head. She had known that it would only be a matter of time before the myriad of fallen warriors would start showing up. Freyja had hoped that the recent move would have bought her just a bit more time. But at that point, she was tired of trying to hide from them. \n        She simply sighed, looked the man in his eyes, and said, \u201cWelcome to Sessr\u00famnir, brave warrior.\u201d {1} She gestured to the little kitchen with bundles of herbs drying from an exposed beam, a tea kettle thrummed on the stove. \n        \u201cThis is the eternal reward for your exceptional bravery and prowess on the battlefield.\u201d \n        The young man could not keep the confusion and disappointment off his face as he remarked, \u201cSessr\u00famnir?\u201d \n        By then, Freyja was used to the look of disappointment on their faces when the ghosts of Norse warriors realized they hadn\u2019t been chosen to join the banquet in Valhalla. But, it still stung every time she saw their existential dissatisfaction. She just stood up with her dirty dishes and called him to the sink. \n        \u201cHere, if you are staying with me, you\u2019ll need to earn your keep.\u201d \n        Freyja led the ghost over to the antique sink, filled it with warm water and soap and showed him how to wash dishes by hand, and where to put them in the drying rack. She turned back to the stove with the hot kettle on it and said, \n        \u201cWhile you do that, I\u2019ll go ahead and make us some tea.\u201d \n        The warrior, fully engrossed in his new task, smiled and nodded in response. Freyja pulled large handfuls of dried herbs and set to making a huge batch of a relaxing tea blend. She knew that once the first soul showed up, many were soon to follow. She had spent close to a century moving from home to home trying to escape the dead warriors. The inevitability of it all sunk deep in the pit of Freyja\u2019s stomach. She watched the ghost with his translucent arms in the suds, and she finally accepted that Sessr\u00famnir was not a singular place, it was any dwelling that she made her home.\n        By the end of the day, Freyja\u2019s quiet home was filled with the ghosts of warriors covered in gruesome wounds. The kitchen was packed with translucent bodies bumping into one another, laughing and talking. A couple would occasionally drift up to the rafters to grab a handful of dried herbs. Every single ghost had a task: some were setting the long table in preparation for dinner, others stood over a large pot of boiling soup, taking turns taste-testing their culinary creation. A whole group of Valkyries were busy outside planting tulip, hyacinth, and crocus bulbs for the upcoming Spring. \n        Freyja shooed a group of ghosts away from the oven, so she could safely pull out a couple of loaves of sourdough bread she had baked with her poltergeist guests. They followed her in a big group as she carried the bread straight to the kitchen table. Their eyes were wide with wonder as they marveled at the fruits of their labor. She had forgotten how much she enjoyed this part of her strange life. \n        The warriors who died in battle often came to her broken and perpetually trapped in a state of fear that lingered from the last of their mortal moments. Freyja felt a pang of guilt as she watched them excitedly placing plates of food on the table and filling up each other\u2019s mugs with mead. She felt ashamed for becoming so wrapped up in her own sadness that she lost sight of her place in the world. She\u2019d forgotten how much she enjoyed giving them peace in their afterlife. Freyja had grown to resent having to teach them the skills they had forgotten in death: cooking, cleaning, gardening, sewing and knitting.\n        She\u2019d forgotten the magic in watching these warriors slowly forget the horrors of war. Freyja called everyone to the long kitchen table, they all sat down in mismatched chairs in front of mismatched table settings, and marveled at the huge dinner spread laid out before them. She stood at the head of the table. For the first time in a long time, Freyja felt the warmth of the fire in her hearth and all the wonderful smells washed over her in a wave. She felt content. Her two cats rubbed up against her leg as she took in the sight of her strange dinner party, and Freyja decided that this would be her home until the end of time."}

The narrator is a trans woman with regrets about her life, who has also been haunted by an apparition in a green dress. The story should have a happy ending, and be between 1900 and 2000 words long.","targets":"        It was June of 2088, my classes were done, finals were graded, and with nearly three months of relative freedom, it was time to work on my other project \u2014 the one that would\u2019ve probably gotten me in trouble or, at minimum, severely mocked. If my colleagues had known that I was experimenting with transmitting information backward in time, they\u2019d have probably felt the need to stage an intervention.\n        It wasn\u2019t that I disagreed with them, exactly.\n        But for decades, I\u2019d been haunted by two things: an apparition and a missed opportunity.\n        A woman in a forest green dress had appeared throughout my life, from when I was six until maybe three or so years ago. I\u2019d always been alone when she appeared, and while her face was visually hazy, that green dress was so vivid that I couldn\u2019t just assume I was having odd hallucinations. But even with her most recent appearance, I had honestly dismissed those events as not relevant to my life. After all, it wasn\u2019t like she interacted with me.\n        The opportunity happened a bit over forty years ago. When I was getting my master\u2019s in physics, I had a golden moment when all the factors aligned, and I could have started my transition. I knew the data, knew that men in physics were taken more seriously than women, but the person that I was then wasn\u2019t sure if I should keep telling the world I was male when I knew I was female.\n        I made the decision to not transition yet and continued telling the world I was a man, when that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It was all in the pursuit of the idea that I\u2019d get taken more seriously as a man, get better job opportunities, and get to a point where I could transition safely enough.\n        Thirty-seven years later, I threw up my hands and started transitioning anyway. The academic field wasn\u2019t going to get any more accepting. I\u2019d been in a stable, if quiet, job for most of my post-Ph.D. career, and the social consequences of transitioning hadn\u2019t gotten any worse since the mid 2040s.\n        Shortly after that decision, the woman in the green dress stopped appearing. It made me wonder if, deep down, my subconscious had been responsible for the hauntings.\n        I think that of the two hauntings in my life, regret is worse. It\u2019s all hindsight, of course, but at least the woman in the forest green dress never seemed threatening or harmful. Regret, on the other hand, felt like a near-infinite weight, dragging me down. \n        I lived alone in my house. I hadn\u2019t ever worked up the courage to try to make friends, much less date. I had only just started connecting with the LGBTQIA community this year, the third since I made the decision to start transitioning, and only then because my therapist insisted. I felt like there were so many missed opportunities in my life because of that one choice I made in my twenties.\n        Time travel in the science fiction books I loved generally fell into three categories: go back in time and make the present worse, go back in time and start a new timeline, or go back in time and nothing really changes. And most of the stories assume the ability to physically send yourself back in time, which if my calculations were right, would take more energy than actually exists in the universe.\n        My method was far more limited. Information was carried in light, encoded in particles with no mass, and therefore it required far less energy to move into the past. And you could only send that information to yourself. I\u2019d used the term \u201centwinement\u201d in my notes to describe the phenomenon of all people having a continuous link to the past, thus allowing for the transmission of information like that. It was a one way message; I hadn\u2019t figured out any way of making two-way communication feasible.\n        And I knew that it worked because last week my future self sent the information I needed, the final piece of the equation that I would (and did) make everything work.\n        Today, the high energy lab was deserted. Today, practically the entire campus was emptied for the two-week break between spring and summer semesters. Today, I was going to make history, and hopefully change my history.\n        My first attempt was intended to be simple: I had to close the causality loop with the correct form of the equation. I\u2019d built a \u201cprojection box\u201d \u2013 really, just an easily assembled, shower-stall sized assembly of PVC pipes, cameras, and microphones \u2013 and written the equation as clearly as possible for my past self. And after all the work I\u2019d put in, it was simple enough to have the computer run the program, gather the information from the projection box, and send it to the right moment in the past.\n        What I hadn\u2019t expected was an intense feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu a few seconds later. I had been there before, even though I hadn\u2019t, because this was the first time I\u2019d tried this. Dizzy, I said out loud, \u201cNote to self. Information sent to myself in the past may generate d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu type sensations in the present.\u201d\n        The next experiments were me, standing in the projection box, recording images for ten to twenty seconds, and instructing the computer to send those images backward to my past. I needed to calibrate the system, and ensure that I could narrow the transmission window to the exact moment I needed. I had to be alone, in my bedroom in my shared apartment, looking at the paperwork. I mostly knew the time \u2014 It had been forty years.\n        Each transmission session led to the same sensations that I\u2019d been there before, but not really. Some were intense, some were faint, but every single time, my vision would blur a bit, and the moment would seem both completely new but utterly familiar.\n        After twenty transmissions, the computer reported a strong candidate time and location for the final message. Strong, as in the computer reported a certainty of point nine repeating for twelve digits. There was a certainty that my past self would be in a position with the necessary characteristics to ensure that I\u2019d receive that message forty years before now.\n        Trembling, I placed the monitor with my prepared speech in front of the projection box. It should correspond (according to the computer) with me looking mostly at my past self, telling that younger me to take the opportunity, to not let life pass her by.\n        I brushed down my dress nervously, stepped into the space defined by the boundaries of the PVC piping, and began.\n        \u201cHello. To forestall the obvious, I\u2019m you, forty years in the future, and this is a one-way message. This is what you\u2019ll be like if you decide not to take advantage of this opportunity. Yes, eventually I will transition, but not for another thirty-seven years. Long, difficult years of hiding in the closet, hiding from everyone around me, and cutting off the world so that nobody could find out my secret. Our secret.\n        \u201cI\u2019m begging you, my past self. Please take this chance. I\u2019m slowly crawling out of my self-imposed shell now, but it\u2019s hard. Too hard. Hard enough that the physics of informational time travel seem less impossible than trying to make a friend.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s taken me years to start to learn to love myself. I\u2019m sending this because I really and truly hope that you can learn this sooner than I did.\n        \u201cI have no idea whether this will lead to a parallel universe forming. I do know that in all the time I\u2019ve been researching this, that doesn\u2019t seem likely, but never say never, I suppose. If it does, then I hope that you end up in a happier universe than I did.\n        \u201cI chose the name Jane, for our aunt who was so wonderful. Please pick a name that makes you happy. Please take the chance on this opportunity. I think we\u2019ve only got the one life, and I want you to live the best one you possibly can. And yes, I\u2019d like to benefit, but I hope, at the absolute least, you do.\u201d\n        The computer beeped once I gave the cut-off signal. \u201cSignal recorded, estimated time for compression is two minutes. Transmission in three minutes, mark.\u201d \n        Shivering now with the weight of what I\u2019d done, I went to the most comfortable seat in the lab, a love seat that had been there since the dawn of the lab. If there was only one timeline, and I was right, I\u2026 didn\u2019t know what would happen. Would my past self even see my message? Would that younger me take future me seriously? And if so, what might my life be like right now?\n        \u201cT-minus two minutes to transmission and counting.\u201d\n        Nervously, I brushed down my dress. One of my favorites, a deep forest green that \u2013\n        A deep, forest green. Just like in all my hauntings. She was a woman of indistinct features, and I knew I hadn\u2019t calibrated the cameras aiming at my face until the last transmission.\n        I was six the first time I saw her. Saw me. I was riding my bike, and the shock made me lose my balance, fall, and break my left arm.\n        The last time I saw her, I would have sworn she waved at me, and my mind immediately correlated that to test ten, when I started adding in simple motions to test complexity in the encoding.\n        \u201cT-minus one minute. Encoding complete. Information density within expected parameters.\u201d\n        All the times I\u2019d been haunted by this apparition in a forest green dress, and it was just me, testing my project. Stunned, I stared at the projection box, down at my dress, then up again. If all the memories I had of being haunted were just me, but I didn\u2019t remember this final message, did it even happen?\n        The computer announced, \u201cZero. Message transmitting.\u201d\n        For a heart stopping moment, nothing happened. And then the world went dark.\n        \u201cJane? Jane? Wake up, please?\u201d\n        Someone was shaking me \u2014 a pleasant voice, a woman. I forced my eyes open, and a woman I\u2019d never seen before was crouched in front of me. She had bright pink hair in a side shave, a couple of piercings in her ears, and one in her nose. \n        That the rush of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hit me again, and then I remembered her, my partner, Molly. I remembered the message I\u2019d just sent myself, and taking that one opportunity presented to me forty years ago. \n        I recalled meeting Molly a few years after I had sent that message. The party was at an LGBTQIA mixer hosted by the community center at the university. There was dating, awkwardness, and then love, marriage, and finally, contentment. And a physics career that looked only a little different from the now fading memories of that life where I had taken the other path.\n        \u201cIt worked!\u201d\n        \u201cOh, good,\u201d Molly laughed. \u201cI like us being together now. How many more tests or messages?\u201d\n        I thought back through my memories, noted two new ones, and smiled. \u201cTwo more, to ensure the continuity of things.\u201d \n        The first was me telling myself to say \u201cyes\u201d to the woman I love, and the second was a memory of me urging myself to take this job, because it would put me where I needed to be for all of this to happen. \n        \u201cNothing as bad as this run, but I\u2019ll still have the computer delay sending the messages, just in case. And honestly? Afterward, I\u2019m disassembling this and spending a long time pondering ethics,\u201d I said. \n        I needed to haunt myself twice more, to ensure I was never haunted by regret again."}

The cold pecked at her flesh and bones through her woolen jacket, like so many vultures feeding upon a corpse. At this time of day, the sun had just about finished tracing a path for its estranged lunar love. Katya only had a handful more minutes to reach Nana.\n        At the heart of the woods, in a hut carved out of a great tree, lived a woman that Katya understood to be her grandmother\u2019s grandmother\u2019s grandmother. Katya didn\u2019t know exactly how many generations ago the woman in the hut had been born, but she did know that she was ancient, and that she had requested to be called Nana.\n        Nana had supplied Katya with a specific set of instructions to follow when she came to visit. The hut would not be there if Katya visited in the day, but the woods were too dangerous to traverse at night, so Katya was to come in the in-between hours, just as the sun was gone, but not forgotten. There was a specific route Katya was to follow in order to reach the hut: in through the path, left on the first turn right, then through the trees, keeping the bushes on her left. After that, the hut would be just past the stream with the fallen log.\n        As Katya approached, she could faintly hear the sound of the running stream mingling in the air with all the other mischievous forest sounds. Another breath escaped her lips, turning to fog that wisped and twirled, looping about to point in the direction of Nana\u2019s home. Katya continued forward, walking towards the tree that split the sky.\n        She stopped in front of the door, carved into the side of the great oak, the faintest light escaping from beneath its outline. \n        Katya knocked twice, and only twice. \n        The door opened. \n        The scent of warm stew and chamomile candles purged the cold from Katya\u2019s body, and she stepped inside, shutting the door behind her. Katya let out a sigh, unzipping her jacket, placing it atop the reading chair she always borrowed. The home was larger on the inside than it appeared on the outside: a spacious room, wooden walls seemingly chiseled out by hand, with an enormous handcrafted table and a roaring fireplace. Atop the fireplace sat a pot, and at the table sat Nana.\n        \u201cLittle Katya,\u201d Nana said, smiling softly, \u201cit is so wonderful to see you again.\u201d\n        Nana was an old woman, wrinkled like a prune, long spindles of gray hair strewn down her shoulders. Every visit, Nana was wearing a sweater of a different color, despite the fact that Katya had not once found a closet or compartment in which Nana would keep her clothes. \n        Katya smiled in return. \u201cGood evening, Nana.\u201d\n        \u201cCome, come, sit down. Tell me how you have been.\u201d\n        Katya visited Nana every other week. Every time, all Nana wanted to know was what was going on in Katya\u2019s life. If nothing else, Nana was an excellent listener, so Katya always talked about her petty coworkers at the bank, about her little dog, and about her ever-gentle husband. Every time, no matter if Katya was ecstatic about her week or venting about her life, Nana sat and listened. Her ancient form sat motionless with an unwavering smile, whole and content.\n        \u201cHe keeps making dinner on the days I\u2019m supposed to,\u201d Katya commented. \u201cHe says he\u2019s worried he\u2019s not pulling his weight. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n        Still smiling, Nana just nodded slowly and said, \u201cHe is a kind man.\u201d\n        Katya grimaced. \u201cYeah. I just wish he\u2019d talk to me more about what was wrong.\u201d\n        \u201cGive him time, little Katya,\u201d Nana said. \u201cHe gifts you with a love that is kind and true, and you grant him the same. He will come to you when he is ready. Good bread dough needs time to rise before you can pop the bubble.\u201d\n        After pausing to understand the metaphor, Katya giggled. \u201cI never knew you were a baker, Nana.\u201d\n        \u201cI have been alive for so many of your lifetimes,\u201d Nana said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken up more hobbies than you can imagine.\u201d\n        \u201cWriting?\u201d\n        \u201cPlenty.\u201d\n        \u201cKnitting?\u201d\n        \u201cI made all my own sweaters.\u201d\n        \u201cWater skiing?\u201d\n        Nana frowned. \u201c...Perhaps when my bones were younger.\u201d\n        They both laughed.\n        A moment passed, and Nana\u2019s eyes seemed to drift away. Katya knowingly waited, sitting and watching as Nana sat at attention, looking at a corner of the room Katya was not in. It only ever took a few moments for Nana to come back to reality, life returning to her expression.\n        \u201cAh, your mother is here,\u201d Nana said. \u201cShe says she loves you, as she always does.\u201d\n        Katya smiled ruefully. \u201cDid she say anything about my husband this time?\u201d\n        Nana shook her head. \u201cNot this time. I daresay she has begun to accept him.\u201d\n        \u201cNot that she can do anything about it now,\u201d Katya mumbled. \u201cTell her that I love her, too.\u201d\n        As Nana\u2019s gaze grew dim once again, Katya hunched over a bit, her lips turning to a frown. Nana returned, and Katya sat up straight again.\n        \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s mother is here as well,\u201d Nana said.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Anastasia?\u201d\n        \u201cCorrect,\u201d Nana said, smiling. \u201cShe said you grow more beautiful by the day. She also believes that you are pregnant.\u201d\n        Taken aback, Katya took a moment to respond. \u201cI\u2026 is she right? Can ghosts see that?\u201d\n        \u201cNo,\u201d Nana stated. \u201cShe is projecting because she wishes for that to be the case.\u201d\n        Katya let out a laugh. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not pregnant, as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d\n        Nana nodded. \u201cGood, good. You are still too young. You must enjoy being young and beautiful while you can, yes?\u201d\n        \u201cPeople don\u2019t stop being beautiful after having kids, though,\u201d Katya commented.\n        \u201cOh, little Katya, you are lucky your grandmother is not here today,\u201d Nana said. \u201cWhen she used to visit, she would go on and on about what happened to her body after your mother was born.\u201d\n        Katya scoffed. \u201cSounds about right.\u201d\n        \u201cNo scoffing. Respect your elders.\u201d\n        \u201cYes, Nana.\u201d\n        Nana paused, tilting her head. \u201cYou look troubled, child. Is there something you would like to ask?\u201d\n        Ever since Katya had learned of Nana, this immortal woman who had survived countless generations of her family, there had always been a question lingering on her lips. She\u2019d considered her wording on every trek through the woods, but it had never escaped the cage of her mind. Katya didn\u2019t want to know the answer, no matter how badly she needed to.\n        \u201c... Nana?\u201d\n        \u201cMm?\u201d\n        Katya pursed her lips. \u201cWhen\u2026 when I die, will I haunt you like the others?\u201d\n        Nana\u2019s face fell, and she quickly shook her head. \u201cOh, child\u2026 please do not describe it so,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is nothing so nefarious.\u201d\n        \u201cYou were cursed,\u201d Katya said.\n        \u201cI made a wish that I worded poorly, and it was granted,\u201d Nana corrected. Katya opened her lips to protest further, but Nana continued speaking. \u201cThe essence of what I wished for remains, even though it is not in the form I expected it to be. I am allowed to stay with the ones I love for all of eternity. That is all that matters to me.\u201d\n        \u201cSo\u2026 does that mean when I die, I\u2019ll\u2026?\u201d\n        Nana smiled sadly. \u201cYes, little Katya. I will survive you, and your children, and your children\u2019s children, and all their children after that.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cAnd when you pass, you will be able to visit me again, yes.\u201d\n        Katya sat, hands on the table, lips pursed and brow tensed. Within the silence that permeated the hut, Nana sat and waited. As always, she listened with a smile, whole and content.\n        \u201cI\u2019ll keep visiting, Nana.\u201d\n        \u201cI know you will.\u201d\n        \u201cI love you, Nana.\u201d\n        \u201cI love you, too.\u201d\n"}

I passed over the gravel road and watched as a Model T whizzed by, forcing me to shield my eyes with my hand to avoid the bits of gravel flung up from the car\u2019s wheels.         The year was 1912, and I had fished all morning in the creek to no avail. \n        The winter was going to be hard in the holler this year. At least that is what Ma Reedy told me earlier in the week. It was only September, but already the mountains looked wounded. Red and orange leaves dotted the valleys, and the tops of the peaks were covered in naked, skeletal trees. Ma Reedy had noted that the persimmon pits were oddly shaped this year and that spiders were spinning larger webs. All of these things, she said, gave a clear sign that the winter would be a tough one.\n        But these mountains were used to tough times, as was I. My family had moved into this hollar from somewhere in the Carolinas, or so the story goes. My great-grandfather found this secluded gap in the mountains, known as a \u201chollow\u201d or a \u201choller\u201d to Appalachian people, where he decided to settle. In the 1840s, he built the family a shotgun house characteristic of working class Southern homes of the time.  I had a small gabled front porch followed by a straight line of three rooms, a den, a bedroom, and a kitchen along with a back door facing the upslope of the mountain. \n        My great-grandfather had moved to the area to harvest lumber. He married my great-grandmother not long after that and quit working the woods to become a coal miner. The timber companies often employed people seasonally, but the mines were open twenty four hours a day and all year round, giving more steady work to the local population. Mining remained the main source of money flowing into the area. The mines continued to take our boys into their dark embrace, providing a barely-living wage while slowly killing the miners from the inside out. My great-grandfather died coughing up blackness when he was only forty-two.\n        I crossed over the gravel road and continued up the pathway. I saw the smoke curling out from my chimney in the distance like a cat\u2019s tail. The squirrels were furiously working, gathering the various nuts from the hardwoods that the timber men could not conquer before giving way to coal mining. I was grateful that my holler had not been touched by the mines, at least not yet. Only the gravel road and the scattering of cabins and houses across the mountainside gave hints that this age-old Appalachian corner of the world had been touched by man at all. \n        I passed by the opening to Nathlacofkee Cave on my right. Once, as a child, I went into the cave after Sunday services while all the adults were at my house eating dinner. I carefully stepped through the narrow cave opening, ducking my head under the limestone rocks.  It was pitch black inside and smelt of a deep dampness. I waited for my eyes to adjust, but they did not. It was as if the cave contained a blackness unknown and unrivaled anywhere else on earth. This void of light frightened me. I scrambled out of the cave in tears and ran all the way back to my house. When Daddy found out where I had been, I received a sound swatting with a hickory switch.\n        My Daddy had told me that women should never go into the caves. He said that women, as creators of life, were closer to God. Should a woman or a girl enter such a space, her presence could close the open veil between this world and the next. I had wondered why these veils should remain open in the first place. \n        Even back then, I was more scared of Daddy\u2019s switch than ghosts. I had already learned that the holler haunted people, not the other way around in this part of the country. The mountains often took people through disease, violence, or some combination of the two, and sometimes I wondered if the mountain did so to keep us close always. \n        I walked past Ma Reedy\u2019s place first. She was on her porch in her chair as usual, fiddling with some sort of tangle of herbs. Ma Reedy was always gathering something or another to put into a tonic or grind up into a medicinal powder. I gave her a cursory wave and quickly went up the trail into my own cabin. \n        I set down my fishing pole next to the front door and pushed open the rusted screen. Daddy was sitting by the hearth, as usual. His face was lined and sooty from the mines.\n        \u201cMa Reedy says a hard winter is coming. I best store up extra acorns for flour and make a few more trips into the woods to hunt turkey before the snow comes in,\u201d I said to Daddy.\n        \u201cMa Reedy is not to be trusted, and you know that,\u201d Daddy said in response.\n        \u201cWhy not? Because she is a woman?\u201d\n        \u201cNo,\u201d Daddy replied. \u201cBecause she is a witch.\u201d\n        \u201cWitch or no, you sure didn\u2019t complain when she used to give you free corn liquor in the summertime.\u201d\n        \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t. We ought to make a trip over to Knoxville this weekend. I get paid on Friday, and we could make a night of it on Gay Street and be back by church time on Sunday,\u201d Daddy said as he glanced at the fireplace.\n        \u201cDaddy, you know we can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n        \u201cWhy not?\u201d Daddy said.\n        I spoke softly to him, \u201cBecause you\u2019re dead.\u201d \n        Daddy said nothing and only looked down at his hands. They were still stripped of flesh in the center of his palms, right through to the bone. The fire that had broken out in 1902, only a decade ago, had caused an explosion deep in the nearby mine where Daddy worked. He and a few other men made it to the elevator before the mine collapsed. Three days later, when the rescuers finally dug down into the shaft and got to the elevator cart, they found Daddy and the other four men dead beneath the rocks. Daddy was still clutching the elevator rope in his hands. \n        With my father gone, I inherited our little shotgun house and the surrounding two acres of farmland. My mother had died in childbirth with me, and with Daddy gone and no siblings, I had the place to myself. Since then, I have technically been alone, but not entirely. The ghosts shifted in and out of the holler at will. Sometimes, I felt crowded by them as they traipsed through the creeks, occupied neighboring homes, or simply stood still in the forest. Sometimes, they disappeared for days and weeks at a time, leaving me all alone with the ghost of the mountain itself.\n        I walked out to the porch and sat on the steps, feeling the first nip of fall in the breeze. I could see Ma Reedy\u2019s back door down the path, slightly ajar. It appeared that she had been laying out deer jerky to cure on the clothesline out back. I had heard talk about Ma Reedy and her spells my whole life. But I felt more pity than fear when I saw her. Her family had immigrated to this area with a group of Scots-Irish people back in the 1690s. Ma Reedy grew up learning traditional medicine methods from her grandmother. Here in the holler, she became what was known back in the Old Country as a \u201ckeening woman.\u201d\n        But people in the mountains could be suspicious, and suspicion could sometimes grow into real danger. In 1745, Ma Reedy caught the eye of the local Anglican minister. He had her dragged to the nearby town square, a few miles south of our holler. He stood by as some of his most zealous followers strung her up and hanged her as a witch. Daddy had always told me that Ma Reedy had run afoul of the townspeople, but Grandpappy said she had probably just run afoul of one town person \u2014 the Anglican minister who had a problem with any woman who did not toe the line.\n        But Ma Reedy still lingered at her little house, nursing her unusual garden and giving out her tonics and remedies to all the local residents in the holler. She did not seem to notice, or perhaps didn\u2019t care, that her head lolled to one side on a sharply broken neck.\n        As I sat on the front step of the porch, I saw a man approaching through the blue, smoky haze that characterized the mountains in this part of the country. Grandpappy walked up the path, looking as handsome as he did in his portraits in his Civil War uniform. He appeared just as he had on the day he died in 1864 in that battle in Chickamauga at the age of twenty-six. At that time, he left behind his young wife, my grandmother, who was then carrying my Daddy in her belly in this very holler.\n        Grandpappy sat next to me on the steps of the porch. His steely blue eyes and chiseled jawline were jarring next to the gaping hole where the top right half of his head should have been. He had died during the battle when his unit charged into the enemy line and into a barrage of cannonball fire.\n        \u201cCan\u2019t you bring Mama with you sometimes, Grandpappy?\u201d I said it to him softly, the fall leaves blanketing the ground in front of us in an oddly comforting gesture. \n        \"Now, child, you know that ain\u2019t how this works. I can\u2019t control her coming back here or not coming back here, just like I couldn\u2019t control the way she left on the day you were born.\u201d Grandpappy looked out into the field as he said this, and his eyes locked onto a cluster of soldiers walking through the stilted cornstalks leftover from the end of the summer harvest.\n        Each soldier seemed to walk on a determined path, as if they knew exactly where they were going. Some wore Confederate gray, while others wore Union blue. Some were old and pale, while others were black and young. While some of the soldiers had severe wounds, such as missing limbs, others seemed to have died of internal injuries that made them look oddly alive. But I knew, in my gut, that all of them had been dead for quite some time. \n        I wondered if any of them would ever make it home. Did they reappear in some other person's holler, far and away? Was Mama walking through a creek bed up near Bald\u2019s Peak? Or somewhere too far yonder to be imagined, like California or China? \n        I reminded myself that, regardless of where or when my Mama was, I still needed to cook supper. I waved to Grandpappy as he joined the group of soldiers and marched off into the foggy, forgiving landscape of the Smoky Mountains."}

But then there was a knock at the door, in her mind she said \u201cWhy!\u201d \n        Rita dragged herself from her bed to check to see who it was, but when she got to the door, there was no one there. She looked around to see if anyone was around, but there was nothing. She wondered if anyone with kids had moved in while she was away. \n        Disregarding the thought she went back into her apartment and went back to her bed. She didn\u2019t care to remove her shoes or her coat, that was just how tired she was. Rita had been on the road for the past five months trying to drum up enough money and support to start her own restaurant. Currently, she had been operating out of a food truck that she had started a year ago. She went from city to city every week, trying to find the perfect place that garnered enough foot traffic and business. \n        After five months of going around the southwestern part of the United States, driving, cooking, serving, and advertising her business wherever she went, she decided that it was time to go back to home base and rest up a bit before she went back to the grind. It was three o\u2019clock in the morning when she finally got up to get a little more comfy. \n        She went into the kitchen where she had left her bags since it was the first place you reached once you entered the two-bedroom apartment. Rita didn\u2019t have the energy to drag them along with herself to her room at the back of the apartment. \n        Once she got to the kitchen she noticed that the flyers she had made for her food truck were scattered on the ground. She picked them up, but what she found on the flyers when she looked at them scared her. \n        Rita could have sworn she saw something moving in the flyer; she admitted the flyers had an intricate design that looked like an optical illusion but what she saw was not a part of the design. Taking a second look, she did not see what she thought she saw.  \n        \u201cNope nope nope, didn\u2019t see a thing.\u201d Rita decided that she just needed more rest after all it was three in the morning.\n        Back in her room, Rita settled to get back in bed when she heard the knocking, but this time it was coming from her bathroom. She was definitely freaking out now. She grabbed the closest thing she could use as a weapon. A wooden crate, with a faded beer label on it, was all there was in her line of sight. \n        She tiptoed her way to the bathroom, with the crate held above her head ready to strike anything that moves. She pushed the door open with her foot, and saw a man standing in her bathroom. She swung the crate, but it passed through the man, and she fell backwards. Seeing this, she wanted to close the door, but she couldn\u2019t since she had already fallen to the floor and was backing up from the entrance to the bathroom. \n        Gathering the courage to approach the bathroom again, Rita saw nothing but a note on her cheval mirror that read, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be afraid of me, I just want to help you.\u201d The bathroom was ice-cold all of a sudden. Still standing in the doorway, Rita saw the man again, and this time he waved. After the initial shock of seeing him the first time she just waved back. \n        Taking a deep breath in and exhaling, Rita said, \u201cOkay, how is it that you want to help me?\u201d She thought she was going crazy or something because she intently waited for this transparent being to communicate with her. She refused to admit it was a ghost, so she just waited. \n        Finally, the being began writing on the mirror again. It was freezing cold in the bathroom so the mirror appeared to have frost on it. He explained in writing, \u201cthis would go faster if you would allow me near you.\u201d \n        Reluctantly, she agreed, the man approached her, and she decided to close her eyes as if she could somehow pretend this wasn\u2019t happening. He touched her shoulder, all of a sudden Rita was hearing him in her mind. \n        \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jeff. I must say your cooking was the absolute best when I was alive.\u201d Shocked by his admission, Rita opened her eyes to look at him. \n        Jeff stood there with a smile on his face and continued, \u201cI had the pleasure of trying your southern fried cabbage the day I died. It was truly the most fitting last meal.\u201d \n        Amazed by his candor, Rita tried to remember when she may have seen this guy at one of the many locations she had been to in the last five months, but she couldn\u2019t place him. Giving her time to digest the information, Jeff continued, \u201cYou won\u2019t remember me because I wasn\u2019t the one that picked up the order, it was my wife. But anyway, let\u2019s get back to the point here. I want to help you with your food truck venture.\u201d\n        Rita took a minute and thought, \u201cHow would a dead man help me with this?\u201d Jeff smirked at her because he knew she was thinking this was crazy. She shrugged her shoulders and gave in, asking, \u201cOkay, how do you suppose you are going to help, because I don\u2019t think having a ghost doing tricks will attract people.\u201d \n        Jeff shook his head and just looked at Rita until she finished her muttering. \n        \u201cFirst and foremost, I don\u2019t do tricks. Second, you need an upgrade girlie girl. Who uses printed out flyers anymore in this technological world? Also, that little design you got on those flyers \u2014 scrap it. I got lost for hours in that thing, trying to get your attention.\u201d \n        Before Jeff could finish, Rita muttered under her breath, \u201cI knew I saw something on those flyers.\u201d\n        Jeff continued to speak, \u201cRita, you need to expand even more than what you have. I\u2019m not saying to expand your territory. I\u2019m saying to reach more people you need to get on those food delivery apps, or at least create a website that will allow people to place orders.\u201d Rita listened on, and she knew what Jeff was saying was true. She was stuck in a time long past when technology was not as widespread. \n        After Jeff finished what he had to say, Rita asked, \u201cSo, if I do all of this, will you let me sleep in peace and stop knocking on everything to get my attention? If you have something to say just leave a note on the mirror.\u201d \n        Laughing at Rita\u2019s acceptance of him and the things he set out for her to do. He gave her some people to contact about setting up some things as far as the delivery service went. Then he allowed her to go to sleep. \n        \u201cSee you later Jeff, we will continue this when I wake up.\u201d Rita said as she closed the door to her room and finally got into her bed and fell asleep.

She heard a faint hiss from beneath the scarf as she adjusted it, and she gave a faint shush in response. She put on her designer sunglasses and grabbed her laptop bag before walking out of her beautiful 3-bedroom brownstone on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. She had bought the property back in 2009, during the peak of the housing crisis, at a rock bottom price. The home had been ornately decorated in chic 1950s style by the previous owner, an elderly woman who had moved into a retirement facility upstate. Medusa kept the home exactly as it was. Sometimes, it felt like she was living in a time capsule there, but that was okay with her. She liked old things. \n        Medusa marched up Fifth Avenue and into the large glass skyscraper on the corner. Her office was located on the top floor, where she worked as the lead editor of a publishing house. Her company was one of the oldest publishing houses in the United States, as she founded it in 1907. Medusa had grown tired of life in Europe and its numerous wars at that point in her several thousand years of life, and so she decided to make a new start in the New World. As an expert in translating Greek mythology from its original language into English, she created a publishing empire in New York City that made her very wealthy.\n        Medusa reached her office and gave a cursory wave to her staff. They all knew not to say a word until she had her extra-strong Italian coffee. She sat down in her executive chair, her steaming cup resting on her desk. She took a long sip and untied her hair scarf with a sigh. A tangle of snakes, green and scaly, peered out, blinking slowly and sleepily. Her office staff promptly looked away from her office windows and down at their desks. They, along with the rest of the world, had learned long ago to avoid staring at Medusa.\n        Medusa looked out at the city. She watched the people dotted below, hurriedly walking to their destinations. They had such intention and purpose in their steps. Sometimes Medusa felt that she had no purpose in this world. Her two monstrous sisters, Stheno and Euryale, who still lived back in Greece, had told her last weekend when they video chatted that she should try harder to enjoy her life in New York City. She had wealth, power, money, and the odd romance now and then, usually with blind, attractive men. What more could she want in life?\n        But Medusa did want more. She still carried the sharp scar on her neck from Perseus\u2019 attempt on her life, from what seemed like many lifetimes ago. The story claimed that she was killed in the attack, prevented from petrifying Perseus by his silly, shiny shield. In actuality, she had petrified the would-be hero, unhinged her jaw, and swallowed him whole as a delicious after-dinner dessert. The myth of her demise that was carried into perpetuity was merely a rumor made up by the ancient Greek media. Fake news was such a problem back in those days. She used the rumor to her advantage, however, setting up a new life in Italy not long afterward. \n        Medusa sat back in her office chair, coffee still in hand, and thought about how her life had gone from mythical sea gorgon to modern woman in the span of many centuries. All this time, she refused to stagnate as a monster. She was, after all, the only mortal gorgon among her trio of sisters. She felt destined, unlike them, to follow the more human elements of her personality. In this regard, she knew that she must continue her path of self-exploration until some upstart hero successfully slayed her.\n        Medusa decided today would be the day that she would announce her retirement to the company board of executives so that she could focus her work on her true love in life: creating art. Her monthly meeting with the board would begin in just over an hour. She carefully tied her scarf back over her snakes, finished her coffee, and prepared for one last meeting as a publishing powerhouse.\n        One hour later, Medusa waltzed into the conference room. It was filled with middle-aged men, all exceedingly wealthy from working for         Medusa\u2019s lucrative company. Medusa sat at the front of the long table and began her prepared speech from a small index card that she pulled out of her front jacket pocket.\n        \u201cHello gentlemen. Today\u2019s meeting will be different from our usual discussions on sales numbers and benchmarks. Instead, I will be discussing my retirement from the company.\"\n        A gasp and a small slurry of whispers consumed the room as Medusa cleared her throat and continued.\n        \u201cGentlemen, I know this departure may seem sudden, but I will be leaving you in the hands of each other. You are all talented leaders in your own right. From now on, you will all be co-CEOs of this wonderful company. As of today, I will be transferring the helm to you as I begin my new career path as an artist. Art has always been a special part of my life that I have neglected for far too long. With my retirement, I can devote myself full-time to creating a wonderful collection to share with the world. I am sure you have some questions related to my departure and the business transition, so fire away.\u201d Medusa placed her hands in her lap and smiled, feeling free at last to pursue her dreams.\n        Voices then shouted out in a cacophony of questions. \n        \u201cAre you really going to leave us without a specific leader? Is that because there isn't another woman on the board to become CEO?\" said one executive.\n        \u201cDefinitely,\u201d replied the man sitting next to him. \u201cA woman will always pick another woman to take her place, if given the chance. It\u2019s science.\u201d\n        \u201cDo you even have any background in art or art history? You do know that being an artist is not a real job, right?\u201d said another executive, side-eying Medusa with crossed arms.\n        \u201cIs this because you are pregnant? You can tell us the truth! If so, I am so glad that you have finally answered your true calling to become a mother,\u201d said a third executive in an assured tone.\n        \"Oh, for the love of Zeus!\u201d Medusa could not stand this any longer. She rolled her eyes, stood abruptly from her chair, and ripped off her scarf. Her snakes uncoiled, and they stared, along with Medusa, into the eyes of the men in the room. In an instant, each of them froze, faces aghast and mouths gaping, petrified into solid white marble statues.\n        Medusa sat back down with a characteristic sigh and pressed a button on the conference room phone, transferring her call over to her assistant executive, Helen O. Troy. \n        \u201cHelen, call John over at my studio downtown. Get him to bring the appliance dolly and a few extra pairs of hands. I will need a little help cleaning out the conference room and my desk in the executive suite. Also, you are the new CEO of Gorgon Publishing, LLC. Congrats. You start tomorrow.\u201d\n        Medusa glanced across the room. The elaborate marble work glistened in the light that shone in through the large conference room windows. Medusa tied her scarf back on her head and smiled, saying in soft reverie, \u201cMy first day as an artist is already off to a great start.\u201d"}

The monster, Glassia, was a hideous, dog-like beast with sharp teeth, warm eyes, and a childlike curiosity. Behind him flew his spirit friend, Camio, a black thrush flying with a saber sheathed at his side. Camio had chanced upon one of Glassia\u2019s bi-nightly dumpster diving sessions and had followed the creature around ever since, offering guidance and words of wisdom when requested.\n        As the pair scampered about, Glassia couldn\u2019t help but keep a closer eye on the beings around him \u2014 the tall, bipedal predators he was trying to avoid. He stopped and stared at a pair of them, two adults, walking and holding hands with the giggling child they flanked protectively.\n        \u201cCamio?\u201d Glassia asked.\n        The bird, flying half asleep, awoke with a snort. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d\n        Glassia looked up at the translucent bird, then gestured with his snout towards the family of humans. \u201cHow do I get what they have?\u201d\n        Camio looked at Glassia, at the humans, then back at Glassia. \u201cWhat, a child? Trust me, you don\u2019t want one of those.\u201d \n        \u201cNo, not the child.\u201d\n        \u201cYou want to procreate?\u201d\n        Glassia scoffed, shaking his head. \u201cI want to be more human.\u201d He looked back at the humans, the heart within his barrel-shaped chest pounding with a sense of longing. \u201cI want to feel love, as they do.\u201d\n        Flapping his wings, Camio fluttered about, landing on top of Glassia\u2019s head. \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s easy! I know exactly how to become human!\u201d\n        \u201cYou do?\u201d\n        \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ve guided plenty of monsters on how to get what they want. It\u2019ll be tough, though. You sure you\u2019re up for it?\u201d\n        Glassia nodded eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything!\u201d\n        \u201cAlright, well, here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna start\u2026\u201d\n        \n        The first step was to secure their hideout.\n        It was simple enough. Glassia lived in a cave on the outskirts of the village, and all he needed to do was follow Camio\u2019s instructions to draw warding circles in a perimeter around it. It would keep intruders out, Camio explained, so that they could finish the ritual without interruption. It took Glassia a while to carve the precise circles with his enormous, bear-like claws, but within a day\u2019s time, he had finished.\n        During that time, Glassia watched Camio, staring at him and trying to evaluate his thoughts. Delving into the minds of others had always been one of his greatest weaknesses. His kind didn\u2019t have some kind of inherent mind-reading ability, but whenever Glassia thought he knew what another was thinking, he was always wrong.\n        When he was a younger monster, his horns still smooth nubs and his hair not so badly matted, he had thought the humans would welcome him. He had watched them from outside so long, and seen their smiling faces alight with love and laughter. When he approached, however, that love turned to fear, and that was the first time Glassia realized that he could not know what dwelled within the hearts of others.\n        After the circles were finished, Camio explained the next step: to bring a human child into the warding circles.\n\n        It wound up being a much simpler process than Glassia had anticipated. They had approached the edge of town, standing outside a window Camio had gone out to select earlier in the day. A child slept peacefully in his bed, even through the sound of the window creaking open. Camio flew inside, sat atop the child, and chanted some kind of hymn.\n        \u201cA charm of sleep,\u201d Camio explained, \u201cso we don\u2019t wake him up during the ritual.\u201d\n        Glassia nodded, then gently took the scruff of the child\u2019s collar between his teeth. He gingerly peeled the child from his blankets, holding him up in the air before turning around and walking back into the forest. He was only borrowing the child, he told himself. He\u2019d bring him back later.\n        When they returned to the cave, Glassia placed the child on the ground between the warding circles, looking up at Camio eagerly. \u201cWhat now?\u201d He asked. \u201cWe should be quick. We don\u2019t want his parents to know he\u2019s been gone.\u201d\n        Camio, now standing in the air atop webbed feet, not bothering to flap his wings, said, \u201cEat him.\u201d\n        Glassia took a step back, aghast. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n        \u201cEat the child, Glassia.\u201d\n        Looking between the sleeping child and Camio, Glassia shook his head. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d Camio explained. \u201cTo become a human, you must absorb the essence of a human. Eat the child.\u201d\n        Glassia stared at the sleeping child. He was resting peacefully, hands curled on his chest, the same way they had been curled in his parents\u2019 hands earlier in the day.\n        \u201cEat him.\u201d\n        Glassia took a step forward. A leaf crunched beneath his feet.\n        The child gasped, eyes going wide. \n        The two locked gazes. Glassia saw the child\u2019s pupils dilating, his breath quickening, the tension in his muscles as he moved to stand.\n        Camio spat a word from the old tongue, the one Glassia had not heard in many centuries, and the child froze, shocked still mid-motion. \u201cNow\u2019s your chance,\u201d Camio hissed. \u201cDevour him. Take what is yours.\u201d\n        Glassia looked at Camio and shook his head, speaking without hesitation. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d Camio asked, gobsmacked.\n        \u201cI just\u2014I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Glassia repeated.\n        \u201cWhy not?\u201d Camio snarled. \u201cYou already steal from them! You take their food, and you steal their sheep in the night. Why not take this step? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n        Glassia looked at the child. \u201cI\u2026 I can see him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s scared. Let him go.\u201d\n        With a scoff, Camio unfurled his wings, allowing the child to move again. With a frightened yelp, the child scrambled to his feet, fleeing into the trees.\n        \u201cYou happy?\u201d Camio asked. \u201cLook, he\u2019s leaving. Now you\u2019ll never become human.\u201d\n        Glassia stood and watched, feeling the child\u2019s fear still reverberating deep in his chest. He held the emotion of another within himself, clutching it tightly to his breast, allowing it to envelop his being.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Glassia said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d"}

They are written from the gossip about me that is swirling around high society in Paris. The lyrics that reference my unrequited love with Christine cut deep into my soul. However, music to me is not just melody, it is my very heart and soul. Thus, I think Gaston Leroux captures my state of being at this moment, when he says of me, \u201cHe stared dully at the desolate, cold road and the pale, dead night. Nothing was colder or more dead than his heart.\u201d\n        I watch Christine and Raoul disappear into the distance. With her gone, the music that I write falls silent, for she is my muse. What is a musician without a muse? I am devastated. My heart is breaking, and my soul feels like it is a shriveling grape upon a dying vine. I hear the mob coming to get me, approaching like a pack of hyenas intent on capturing their prey. Perhaps, I should let them catch me. After all, what is left for me in this life? \n        Yet, something deep inside me screams run! I disappear into the cavernous tunnels below the Opera House. No one knows these tunnels as I do. They have been my home since I ran away from the circus at thirteen. For thirteen years I was a circus attraction for people to gaze upon my hideously deformed face, to gasp in horror at the sight, and to laugh at the macabre delight before their eyes. They are getting closer to me. I run now as I ran back then, all those long years ago. \n        I continue on for what seems like hours. The time for me has melted together. I need to find a place to rest. Emerging slowly from the depths of the tunnels, I check to make sure that I am alone. It is dark and there is no one around. It must be very late. I race across the street into a small park and hide behind some bushes. As I catch my breath, I realize that I am lost. I am far from the opera house.\n        Again, I hear the music written about me echoing in my head, \u201cDown we plunge to the prison of my mind. Down that path into darkness deep as hell!\u201d \n        Hell, indeed, is the life that I am living. I sink further into the bushes. I remain hiding, until it starts to drizzle, and then I begin to move in the shadows, searching for a more sheltered place before the rain begins.\n        I hear music in the distance and follow it. There is a large house with the window open, and through it, I hear the pitiful sound of a violin played very well, but with no direction. The player curses. I hear a crash and then screaming. I approach the window to find a middle-aged person sobbing.\n        Quietly, ever so quietly, I whisper through the window, \u201cWhy, when you can play like that, do you cry? Music is a gift. Find the right piece to play.\u201d\n        I hear a faint reply, \u201cPlaying is not enough. I am expected to compose to keep my position as conductor. I can\u2019t imagine the notes. There is silence in my mind.\u201d\n        I realize that his silence is my answer \u2014 a way to start over far away from the opera house. \n        \u201cI can compose music for you. I need a place to stay, and a person to buy me writing supplies, clothing, food, candles, and books. You can never tell anyone that I am here, for I must hide. I have money saved to purchase things, so it is just living space I require.\u201d\n        I hear a shuffling as the person approaches the window. He replies, \u201cOn the third floor there is a large bedroom, study, and library. It has not been used since I lost my wife and my ability to write music. But, I must know, where are you from?\u201d\n        \u201cThe opera house,\u201d I reply, \"but while you have probably heard my music, you don\u2019t know of me. I live in the shadows.\u201d\n        \u201cYou are the opera ghost,\u201d he said in hushed tones. \n        I heard his intake of breath. He knows of me, which means he knows of my past deeds. Gossip is, after all, the lifeblood of Paris. \n        \u201cI know what you are said to have done, but I can\u2019t write anymore, not since my wife died. My job as conductor is all I have left. Write music for me, that I can say is my own, and the third floor is yours. I will have food and anything else you need delivered to the house. I will pay you a small monthly stipend in addition to letting you live here in exchange for your music. When we are alone, you can move about freely. When there are guests, you will have to stay on the third floor and remain silent. But, I rarely have guests here now. We will keep the blinds closed, so people will not be able to see inside the house. We can both live whatever life we have left with some modicum of dignity, if we work together.\u201d\n        I think about it. I have no better options, and it is not like I have ever received credit for my work. I wonder if this person can be trusted. After all, he is willing to pass my work off for his own. On the other hand, he is taking a risk having me live with him, especially with my reputation for violence. Perhaps, two desperate men wanting to succeed can make it work together. Both of us have something in common; we both live for music, and have nothing beside that. I agree to his terms, and he invites me in. I walk toward the door, and enter when it opens. \n        Music is my mask. It is how I am able to share myself with the world. I hear the words written about me float inside my head \u201cMasquerade! Hide your face, so the world will never find you!\u201d The world will never find me, never see me. I will always have to hide my face. The world will know me through my music. Music in the name of another man. \n        I\u2019m sure you wonder, did I ever have a moment of redemption for all my evil deeds and the lives I destroyed for love? Perhaps, there is no salvation for the likes of me. I let Christine go; does that count? Is it enough? I live my life with the memories of rage, betrayal, love, and regret. It informs the person I am now, and perhaps the person I have always been.\n        I still hear the echoes of the music written about our love affair playing in my mind, based on the Paris gossip that swirls around about my life. The words I sang to Christine, immortalized in Phantom of the Opera, \u201cYou alone can make my song take flight,\u201d are so very romantic, but delusional. To be a human individual, one must learn to bear the solitude of existence upon one\u2019s shoulders. Contrary to the songs and the gossip, I alone \u201ccan make my song take flight.\u201d It\u2019s from this abyss that I now write the \u201cmusic of the night.\u201d"}

They recognized that some humans had trouble accepting anything that didn\u2019t look like them, and even a small number of humans could be dangerous to dragons. \n        A few of us chose an extended form of hibernation, hoping that at some point, we wouldn\u2019t be seen as a threat anymore.\n        I\u2019d always liked humans. Clever folk with endless curiosity and wonder at the world around them. Certainly, there were some humans who wanted to destroy anyone not like them; the rest were just trying to live their lives.\n        Kind of like dragons, at least in those ways.\n        By the human reckoning of time, I surfaced from my hibernation in March of 2015. My cave was isolated enough that no human had ever discovered it, or even if they had, they hadn\u2019t gotten far enough in to find me. It took me several days to wake up to the point that I could check my defenses and confirm that I hadn\u2019t been mistaken for an unusually shaped rock by an intrepid, exploring human.\n        There was a care package, however. I\u2019d made a deal with an elf with an unusual tolerance for iron to check in on me from time to time. I gave her a third of my hoard of valuables just before I went into hibernation, in exchange for her making sure that whenever I woke up, I\u2019d be at least somewhat prepared for the world.\n        Thankfully, the care package was nearly new. I guessed that she\u2019d been to my cave sometime in the past five years, based on the dust that had accumulated. Her notes on the contents, and the state of the world, were extensive; it took me a few weeks to go through everything she\u2019d written, and when I finished I was frankly amazed. \n        Humans had accomplished so much. They had created incredible ways to communicate with each other and record knowledge and expanded what they knew about the world, from extremely small things to incredibly large things and learned how to fight illnesses that would have devastated them when I was last awake.\n        But they had also repeated the mistakes of the feudal governments I last remembered. They\u2019d done terrible things to themselves in the name of \u201cus, not them.\u201d And they\u2019d damaged the environment in ways that tempted me to go back to sleep and hope that in a century or two, things might be better.\n        But Mirielle, being the clever elf that she is, had also equipped my cave with what I learned was called \u201cthe Internet.\u201d Over the course of a couple of decades, she\u2019d carefully built the infrastructure to ensure that when I woke and had absorbed everything she told me, I\u2019d then be able to learn even more.\n        I admit, I spent more than a month learning about what kind of world I\u2019d woken up into. Some of that was catching up on what humans called \u201crecent events\u201d since Mirielle had last visited in 2013. Some of that was falling into so-called \u201crabbit holes\u201d of information while losing hours clicking from link to link.\n        And I found, again thanks to Mirielle, hidden websites, run by the non-humans for the non-humans. There were repositories of information detailing the experiences of the non-humans who\u2019d stayed in this world and adapted to it, along with recommendations for newcomers and returning folk like myself.\n        Mirielle visited after I established an email account, gave me a sum of human money in exchange for some coins from my hoard, and provided me with some suggestions on fitting in. Once she left, I started the process of changing my shape. It had always been a difficult and time-consuming process for dragons, best accomplished in privacy. By the end, I looked human, though I knew my silvery hair and sea-green eyes would likely make me stand out in any crowd.\n        By June of 2015, I felt ready to attempt to rejoin the human world. Or at least as ready as I could be, given my nature. I had clothing chosen by Mirielle to blend in with the rest of the humans, sufficient modern money for necessities on a first trip, a smartphone with a number of useful apps, and a clear objective for my first venture into the modern human world \u2014 I would try to get coffee from a local place.\n        The first difficulty was getting down from my cave. When I\u2019d chosen this cave, I hadn\u2019t considered that I might need to walk on two legs for any sizable distance. The nearest trail was a significant distance down from my cave, and I resolved to send Mirielle many thanks and a bit of my hoard for her wisdom in including hiking boots with my clothing. \n        By the time I was close to the trail, I\u2019d added more to my intended gift. I\u2019d forgotten mammals had the odd habit of sweating, and the athletic leggings and top I was wearing were not still wet the way wool would have been.\n        I spent a fair bit of time watching the trail, waiting for a moment when I could get onto it without anyone noticing that I had been off the path. Perhaps the humans would not give it any thought, but perhaps they would. All I wanted in the moment was to blend in and not draw attention to myself. \n        But the humans walking along the trail were focused on their endeavors. One or two had dogs with them, which presented my second challenge: no matter how thorough the shift, certain animals can still smell the dragon underneath. So I had to wait for an opening in the flow of humans, and one where there wasn\u2019t a dog.\n        After a short amount of time, there was nobody on the trail ahead of or behind me. Exhaling in relief, I stepped onto the hard packed soil and began to casually walk toward what the signs assured me was the trailhead. \n        My first direct encounter with a human was someone dressed in shorts, hiking boots, and a jacket. The human waved at me but kept walking in the other direction. Clearly, nothing about me drew the hiker\u2019s attention, and I grinned at my success. At least that part was going well enough.\n        The third challenge was the parking lot. I\u2019d never encountered asphalt before, and even though the parking lot was closed for the season, there were several people standing around, clearly waiting for something. I would usually stomp around to get a better feel of the material under my feet, but I was pretty sure humans didn\u2019t really do that. \n        One of the humans approached me, curiosity in her eyes. She was dressed similarly to me, though her outfit was a vivid blue where mine was a more simple gray.\n        \u201cI didn\u2019t see you on the bus?\u201d\n        Mirielle had explained that hikers took a bus to the trailhead from the local village and back again. I smiled without showing teeth \u2013 humans can be so uncomfortable at showing each other their teeth \u2013 and replied, \u201cOh, I got here early. I just spent some time sightseeing.\u201d All of which was true, at least in some sense.\n        She nodded, then looked at me more appreciatively. I\u2019d chosen the form of a human woman in her early thirties, athletic but still curvy, and knew that I would be considered attractive by the current standards. This person seemed the sort to be attracted to women, which wasn\u2019t an issue in my current form. I had no idea how she\u2019d react to a dragon, though, and resolved to not let that secret come out.\n        By the time the bus arrived, Jenna had introduced herself, told me a bit about her life, and seemed to be deciding whether she should verbalize her interest in me. Dragons are, on the whole, similar enough to humans in our orientations that I was open to the idea of pairing with a woman, a man, or anyone.\n        I was purposefully vague about what I shared with Jenna. I mentioned taking an extended break after some travel supported by my investments. All true, though a bit vague about timeframe and other matters. \n        \u201cSo, Alix,\u201d Jenna started near the end of the bus ride, and I knew she\u2019d worked up the courage to ask for more of my company. \u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the day?\u201d\n        \u201cCoffee first,\u201d I said seriously, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t really have plans after that.\u201d I blinked slowly at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying your company so far. Would it be impolite to inquire after your plans?\u201d\n        I watched her blush. Such a fascinating mammalian response! And she hadn\u2019t expressed any suspicion I wasn\u2019t as human as her. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to say, \u201cHello fellow human, I am also a human,\u201d but I was still working on fitting in with the surrounding humans.\n        After a moment, she coughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m meeting up for lunch at noon with a couple of friends I haven\u2019t seen since high school.\u201d I remembered the term for a place of education from my research, and nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be comfortable if I invite a stranger, but we could meet afterward?\u201d Her blush deepened.\n        Flirting! Another curious human behavior. Dragons were generally more direct in expressing our interest to each other.\n        I replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to the coffee shop, say around four in the afternoon? Or is that not enough time to catch up with your friends?\u201d\n        Jenna laughed. \u201cFour it is.\u201d The bus squeaked to a stop, the village bustling with so many humans, the diversity was both impressive and distracting. She called, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d as she got off of the bus.\n        I went to a coffee shop that Jenna had recommended, called The Bean Scene. The human behind the counter taking orders looked at me with some curiosity, but recommended a medium roast as one of their best. \n        I took the cup to an empty table, and resolved to watch the flow of humanity while I waited for Jenna. It was a new world, but I seemed to be fitting in well enough so far. There was so much to learn, so much to do, and so many new people to meet. I expected there would be challenges, but the thrill of adapting to this new flavor of humanity left me anticipating the future."}

I just need to make sure I\u2019ve checked every inch of my body to catch any signs of molt. I woke up this morning to find a patch of my skin turning blue. I have to make sure there are no more patches,\u201d Nicky responded, looking frantically down the stairs at her father. \n        \u201cNicky, molting is natural. Why do you feel you have to hide it? Now, come on!\u201d Joshua exclaimed once more. \n        Joshua wondered why his teenage daughter was all of a sudden so concerned about molting, when she paid it no mind last year. As echidnas  they were only ever concerned about their human half being well maintained. They cared less about their lower half, which was that of a serpent. Nicky slithered down in a long dress to cover up as much as she could. Joshua saw a blue patch that Nicky didn\u2019t catch, but he didn\u2019t point it out to her, because they were already going to be late. \n        As they left the house, Nicky went one way and Joshua went the other way. At Hybrid High School, Nicky stopped at the bathroom to check herself one more time before going off to class.  She wanted to look good, since her seat was right next to the demigod Lore. Sometimes he would look over at her and wink. She would always get excited, and her serpent tendencies would come forward. She had been suppressing her serpent side to be more human. However, her tongue was the hardest thing to control when it flicked out just to taste the air around him. \n        Lore was the son of Aphrodite, while his father was human. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, all the girls swooned over him. Even though all kinds of beings attended the school, everyone had segregated themselves to their specific kind outside the classroom. Still, all the girls, no matter what they were, always flocked around Lore. \n        However, Nicky was different. She was not affected by his power of persuasion like the others. Even though she was attracted to him, it was more about his friendliness towards her during class. Plus, Nicky was the only Echidna in the school. Lore felt bad for her and wanted to make her feel accepted. At the same time, Lore was fascinated by Nicky\u2019s resistance to him. After a while, he grew tired of all the girls flocking toward him, which is why he liked being around Nicky. \n        \u201cHi Lore, how\u2019s it going? Did I miss anything worthwhile?\u201d Nicky asked as she sat next to Lore fifteen minutes late for class. Lore looked over at her and shook his head no. He looked to be in deep thought about something, so she left him alone and began listening to the teacher. \n        Lore looked up and over at Nicky and asked, \u201cHey Nicky, sorry, I was daydreaming. I have a question for you. What do you want most in this world?\u201d \n        Nicky looked surprised by the question. She sat still for a second to gather her thoughts because there was so much she wanted. After contemplating the many things she wanted in life, the one thing she focused on was being more human. She hated having to go through ecdysis twice a year, and she longed to have legs. Her serpent tail was the most troublesome thing when it came to going into places, you had to make sure that everything was inside before the door closed. There were many times when her tail got caught in doorways. \n        Lore waved his hand in Nicky\u2019s face to bring her back from the land of contemplation. Nicky blinked a couple of times and shook her head, then answered, \u201cI want to be more human. I grow tired of being a hybrid, especially the only one of my kind besides my father. I wish I could have legs so that my tail wouldn\u2019t get damaged by every doorway.\u201d \n        \u201cIs that all Nicky? Tell me everything. I know there is one more thing you want.\u201d Lore looked at Nicky, hoping she would tell him more. He already knew she was holding back, because he also had empathic powers. He could feel her nervousness to his question and it increased after he asked for more. He also had his own wants, but he wanted to not focus on himself at that moment. \n        Nicky looked at him with her eyebrows raised in shock. She thought to herself, \u201cDoes he know that I secretly like him and would love to get to know him more than just our normal random conversations.\u201d \n        She considered asking him why he wanted to know all of this, but she could tell in his demeanor that he also wanted something more. She answered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of the minority anymore. If I\u2019m more human I can blend in with everyone else. I also want to be accepted. I know you accept me and I appreciate that, but I don\u2019t want to be pitied just because I\u2019m the only one.\u201d\n        Lore listened intently to Nicky\u2019s pleadings. Then he said, \u201cNicky, I understand completely how you feel. You see how all of these girls flock to me, except you? I wish that I could be just an ordinary human being and blend in as well. I like you a lot, Nicky, and I like the way you are. You don\u2019t need legs, even though getting your tail caught in doorways does sound annoying and painful. How about this, every time you have to go through a door, I will be there to make sure your tail doesn\u2019t get caught?\u201d\n        Nicky was taken aback by Lore\u2019s kindness towards her, and the offer to hold the door for her was the sweetest thing ever. Trying to hold back all of her emotions and find the right words to say to Lore, she just smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Lore. That is so sweet of you. And I would really appreciate the assistance with doors.\u201d \n        Just in that small amount of time, class was over, and it was time for lunch. They made their way to the doorway, and Lore held the door for Nicky until she was completely out of the room. "}

Where are you from?\u201d  Hrothmund awkwardly asked the striking woman who sat across from him. \n        They were sharing a mead in Heorot. Their date had been going badly. Hrothmund couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on why the vibe was off, but it certainly was.\n        Grendella was nervous. This was the first date she\u2019d been on since committing to her human form. Her water-monster mother would never approve. However, her mother was gone. Grendella was free to make, and question, her own choices.\n        Hrothmund had been planning this date for weeks. He had met Grendella by the port in town and hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her. He thought that Grendella would be impressed by Heorot. It was his go-to first date spot. All the other girls he had brought here had looked at the mead-hall with awe. The sheer size of the great hall was usually enough to impress the ladies. After some mead, he would show off his favorite woodwork designs, and then casually drop the fact that he had been the chief carpenter in charge of the renovation project.\n        After all the bizarre tragedies that had taken place in the mead-hall last year, the king had paid him to \u201cfreshen the place up.\u201d It had been tedious and sometimes gruesome work. The monster had not only killed thirty men, but he\u2019d also made a horrific mess in the hall. When Hrothmund first accepted the job, Heorot was a gory disaster. However, Hrothmund was meticulous with his work. He\u2019d gotten all the bloodstains out of the woodwork. He had also redesigned the layout of the main seating area and was proud of how much brighter and less cluttered the mead-hall now was. Overall, he\u2019d done an admirable job of transforming it from a site of trauma into a joyful place to drink.\n        Oddly, Grendella seemed far less impressed than anyone else he had brought to the Heorot. Hrothmund was surprised when Grendella looked around the hall with an air of disgust. Her normally beautiful face was screwed up, as if she had just gotten a whiff of something rotten.\n        \u201cI actually grew up near here,\u201d Grendella said, her voice tight.\n        \u201cNo way? It couldn\u2019t have been in Hrothgar's domain. I would have noticed you earlier.\u201d Hrothmund tried to deliver this line in a flirty way, but it didn\u2019t quite land right.\n        \u201cNo. I'm an outlander. I lived with my mom and brother a few leagues away in the eastern lake,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, near the eastern lake,\u201d she corrected herself.\n        \u201cCool. Were you a fisherwoman?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cKind of,\u201d she responded. \u201cI did some fishing, but I did more foraging. My mother did most of the hunting.\u201d\n        \u201cNot your brother?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cNah. My brother was a bum. He never did much work. All he was good at was getting into trouble,\u201d she responded.\n        \u201cMy brother is just like that too,\u201d he said. \n        \u201cReally? What kind of trouble does he get himself into?\u201d Grendella asked.\n        Hrothmund turned serious as he said, \u201cBefore all of that monster drama last year, he used to hang around here a bunch and serve mead to the nobles. He was always stirring the men up into boast battles. He was also pretty good at getting himself into bar fights. But, when all that crazy stuff went down last year, he disappeared. We all thought that he was one of the monster\u2019s victims. It was awful. But then, five months later, my folks got a letter from a Geatland messenger. That loser was a stowaway on Beowulf\u2019s boat and never even said goodbye.\u201d As he spoke, he felt his temper rising in his throat. \u201cI mean, it is one thing for him to abandon me. We always had a difficult relationship. But I still can\u2019t believe that he did that to my mom.\u201d Hrothmund\u2019s voice started to rise in anger. \u201cShe thought he was dead. It drove her crazy.\u201d\n        Grendella looked at him. He could not read her expression. It was like no other expression he had ever seen, and yet he found something in it familiar. \n        \u201cMy brother died last year. And my mom went crazy when we lost him,\u201d she said. Her tone was flat and unaffected, but Hrothmund saw tears in her eyes.\n        \u201cI am so sorry for your loss,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cWe were never close,\u201d she responded. \u201cI am more angry than I am sad. He made so many awful choices. Monstrous, really. He was a violent guy. We used to argue all the time, and to be honest, I was kind of scared of him. But I miss him. It is weird.\u201d\n        \u201cI get that,\u201d said Hrothmund. \u201cWhen I found out that my brother was still alive and had just abandoned us, I almost wished he were dead. But that is not really true. I think I am so angry because I miss him.\u201d \n        \u201cAnger and grief. They can be hard to tell apart,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cThe anger feels monstrous. The grief feels human,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cI think that this grief is making me feel more human,\u201d Grendella responded, her voice softer now.\n        \u201cI think my anger is making me more monstrous,\u201d said Hrothmund.\n        \u201cMaybe we are all a little bit human and a little bit monster.\u201d Grendella looked right into Hrothmund\u2019s eyes as she said this.\n        He looked at her, really looked at her, as if for the first time. Who was this woman? She was unlike anyone he had ever met before. Both were silent for a long moment.\n        \u201cCan I get you another mead?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cNah. This place freaks me out. Let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d she said, getting up from the long table. He took her by the arm and gently escorted her out of Heorot.\n\n"}

I\u2019m not going to bite a human.\u201d \n        Jett sighed. They had had this same conversation for the past six months, ever since Flynn had accidentally turned Selene. Before she was a vampire, Selene was one of their drudges \u2014 human servants, if you will. Someone to run errands in the daylight and offer a source of nourishment. She and the other three human drudges had lived together in the smaller house on the back of the property. But, since becoming a vampire herself, Selene wasn\u2019t interested in feeding from her former housemates.\n        \u201cMaggie, Blake, and Zander don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jett said for the hundredth time.\n        Selene scoffed. \u201cSure, they tell you that. They\u2019re terrified of you.\u201d \n        Jett turned and motioned for Maggie to join them. Maggie came over, sat in the chair next to Jett, and wrapped her arm around his waist. \n        \u201cSelene, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re strong enough to handle it. You need sustenance.\u201d She reached out to touch Selene\u2019s arm, but Selene pulled back as though she had been burned. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she hissed. \u201cTraitor. You sleep in the bed with him every night, letting him consume your blood.

But you can\u2019t survive off stray rabbits forever.\u201d \n        \u201cWell, you won\u2019t have to worry about that anymore,\u201d Selene said, standing up. \u201cI\u2019m leaving Romania tomorrow. I have a ride on a cargo plane to the United States. So, none of you will have to worry about me anymore.\u201d She stared at each of them in turn, daring anyone to try to stop her. Jett sighed again but did not try to change her mind. Selene turned and went to her room, shutting the door behind her.\n       The following night, Selene waited at the edge of the farm for her ride from a fellow vampire named Rhys. She stood with her scant belongings stowed in a raggedy duffel bag, along with the money that Jett had insisted she take. Rhys was going to drive her to the runway and get her in touch with the pilot, Sebastian, who had agreed to let her stow away with the cargo. Selene knew Sebastian was like Maggie, a human who wanted to be fed on by vampires, but she had made no such promises and would not break her resolve. She had yet to taste human blood, and she had no plans of changing that. \n        Selene had asked Maggie, when she was still human, why she enjoyed being a vampire pincushion so much, but Maggie couldn\u2019t really explain it. She just shrugged and said it felt good. Selene couldn\u2019t understand. She had never enjoyed it. \n        Selene knew that the other vampires rolled their eyes at her and mocked her behind her back, but she didn\u2019t care. They had been vampires for many years; their tie to humanity had long been severed. But, Selene had been a vampire for less than a year, and she could still remember the humiliation of submitting to Flynn and Rosalie when they came to feed from her. She would not put another creature through that shame.\n        Finally, Selene saw the headlights creeping down the dusty road. When the old farm truck stopped, she tossed her duffel bag on the floorboard and climbed in. Rhys grunted a hello, but the rest of the drive was silent, and Selene was fine with that. She didn\u2019t have much to say anyway. She was terrified of leaving Romania. Although she hated everyone on the farm right now, it was the only home she had ever known. \n        Maggie had found Selene sleeping in their barn when she was only seven years old. Both of Selene\u2019s parents had been killed in a car crash, leaving her orphaned and homeless. Maggie had brought her up to the servants\u2019 quarters situated on the property behind the main house, and Selene was grateful to have been given a warm place to sleep and a hot meal. But, when she turned eighteen, Selene found out what those meals would cost her \u2014 a lifetime of providing nourishment to the bloodsucking monsters that lived there. She sighed. Now she was one of those monsters. \n        When they arrived at the runway and Rhys had introduced Selene to Sebastian, she thanked him again for the ride. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t mention it, kid,\u201d Rhys said gruffly. He shook Sebastian\u2019s hand, and then Selene was left alone with the pilot. Sebastian looked at her eagerly, and Selene shuddered. \n        \u201cI\u2019m just going to lay down in the back, okay? I\u2019ve gotta be away from windows, and I should probably get some sleep.\u201d Sebastian looked disappointed that Selene had no intention of feeding on him, but he didn\u2019t say anything. \n        Thirteen hours later, Selene felt the plane touchdown on the runway in New York City. She stretched, rubbing her eyes, and searched around for her duffel bag. A few minutes later, Sebastian opened the rear cargo door so Selene could exit. \n        \u201cThank you again for the ride,\u201d Selene said to Sebastian, extending her arm to shake his hand. \n        Sebastian shook her hand and rubbed his neck nervously. It was clear to Selene that he wanted to say more, so she turned quickly and headed toward the road. She hadn\u2019t fed in a few days and needed to find a source immediately. She hadn\u2019t ever gone more than two days without, and she didn\u2019t want to find out if her \u201cno humans\u201d rule would still apply if she was starving. \n        Luckily for her, New York was lousy with sewer rats. This wasn\u2019t Selene\u2019s preferred food source, as they were always wet and smelly, but she could handle the grime-covered rodents for a couple of weeks or more while she figured out something more sustainable. \n        After she had found a couple of rats to feed on, being careful not to drain any of them, Selene wiped her mouth and sighed contentedly. She could do this. She could live on her own, find alternative food sources, and be a more socially acceptable type of vampire. She didn\u2019t need to terrorize humans and live in the shadows.\n        It was nearing two in the morning, and Selene knew she needed to find somewhere safe to sleep before daybreak. She wandered down a handful of deserted streets until she found what she was looking for \u2014 an abandoned building with an old root cellar. \n        She busted through the rotting wood of the door, then barricaded it as best she could. Selene went down the dank, moist stairwell until she was in the cellar. She laid out her blanket and made a little nest to sleep in. It wasn\u2019t the most ideal place, but Selene didn\u2019t have the luxury of being picky. As she drifted off, she made a mental list of the things she needed to take care of when she woke, such as finding more permanent housing and finding a reliable source of nourishment. Slowly, Selene fell asleep. \n        Over the course of the next few weeks, Selene lived on rats and the occasional squirrel or pigeon. She knew this was not a sustainable way of living but maintained her faith that she would figure something better out. Thankfully, she had better luck in the housing department. A few days after arriving in the city, Selene found an ad for a basement apartment for rent. Although she didn\u2019t have a job or income source yet, Jett had given her enough to get by for a few months. \n        Once she paid the first and last month\u2019s rent for the apartment, Selene set about making it vampire-friendly. Thick, dark curtains over the small window at street-level were the first thing she installed. Once she had that handled, she went online to search for a coffin. She had been sleeping on a pallet on the floor since she arrived in New York, and her body was stiff and sore. \n        Feeling satisfied with her home, Selene got back to the most pressing issue in her life: a steady source of blood. She brainstormed ideas, making lists and pacing the floor. Nothing seemed like a long-term solution. Frustrated, Selene decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, hoping the fresh night air would help her think. \n        As she walked the deserted streets, Selene felt pangs of homesickness. She wondered if leaving Romania had been the best choice. She knew she wasn\u2019t like other vampires, who relished the powerful feeling of drinking from a human. She had been an outcast in that house. So, leaving had to be the best choice\u2026 didn\u2019t it? Selene wasn\u2019t sure of anything anymore. \n        As she walked, her senses tingled. The smell of blood was strong here. Where was it coming from? She looked around for a stray animal carcass, anything that could smell so strongly, but she didn\u2019t see anything. And besides, this blood smelled fresh, like it was still warm. Selene looked around at the buildings near her and spotted the source of the smell. It was a slaughterhouse and butcher shop called The Chopping Block. Her mouth watered. She stood on the front stoop, trying to figure out a way into the locked shop. \n        As she checked the storefront for unlocked doors or a busted window, she heard the front door open. A woman appeared. She was tall, thin, and the most beautiful creature Selene had ever seen. She appeared almost ethereal in her paleness, her bright green eyes shining as she approached Selene. \n        \u201cCan I help you?\u201d the woman asked. Selene took a step back. She had done a pretty decent job so far of avoiding humans, but this woman obviously had the keys to this shop. What could Selene tell her that would gain her access? The woman looked at Selene thoughtfully. \n        Her voice barely a whisper, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re one of us.\u201d\n        Selene\u2019s head jerked back in surprise. \u201cYou know what I am?\u201d she replied, her voice hoarse from disuse. \n        The woman nodded. \u201cI have a gift for these things. I can sense it in you.\u201d She beckoned for Selene to enter the shop with her. When she did, Selene saw there was one other person in the room\u2014a short, stocky man with long, black hair and piercing blue eyes. \n        \u201cI\u2019m Lilith,\u201d the woman said. Gesturing toward the man, she added, \u201cAnd this is Everald.\u201d The man stood, approaching Selene cautiously. \n        He reached out and stroked her cheek. Selene flinched. She hadn\u2019t been touched by anyone other than her own nest of vampires, and even that was sparingly. \n        \u201cLilith and I haven\u2019t found any more like us in the city,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d \n        \u201cI\u2019m Selene,\u201d she replied hesitantly. \u201cWhat are you doing in a butcher shop at three in the morning?\u201d As she spoke, Selene looked around, spotting a metal tin filled nearly to the brim with thick, dark blood. Lilith followed her gaze. \n        \u201cOh, my manners! Please,\u201d Lilith said, gesturing toward the bucket. \n        Selene wasted no time; she rushed to the tin, holding it to her lips and drinking deeply. Once she had consumed nearly two-thirds of the blood, she set the tin down, wiping her mouth and grinning sheepishly at the pair. \n        \u201cI am so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have drank so much,\u201d Selene apologized. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I have been in the city for a while now, and all I\u2019ve had are sewer rats and a few squirrels and pigeons. I have to drink from so many of them to get my fill without draining them. It\u2019s been an exhausting time.\u201d She slumped onto an overturned bucket. \n        Lilith and Everald exchanged a look. \u201cCome and work here with us,\u201d Everald suggested. \n        \u201cWork here?\u201d\n        \u201cYes,\u201d Lilith answered. \u201cWe\u2019re the cleaning crew. We work nights once the shop is closed, and we have unmonitored access to all the drained blood from the day\u2019s work. It\u2019s a pretty great setup.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd there\u2019s plenty of blood to go around,\u201d Everald added. \n        Selene looked around at the shop. She was so proud of herself for having the courage to leave the farm, the only place she\u2019d ever known, and venture into this new and unfamiliar place. She had a home here, and now it looked like she would have a job, a food source, and friends.\n        Selene grinned at Lilith and Everald. \u201cCount me in,\u201d she said.\n"}

Luckily, Kelly was on the phone and not a video call, otherwise her clients would have witnessed her eye roll at her daughter\u2019s interruption. Kelly waited to see if Jackie would run up the stairs, knock on the door softly, then slide whatever mail she could fit under the door. She knew never to come into the office when Kelly was working. \n        After hanging up the phone, Kelly looked at the floor to see what mail had come along with a note that said \u201cSorry Mommy, I forgot to use my indoor voice again. Can I go outside and play?\u201d Kelly could imagine Jackie whispering her apology and then a burst of energy coming with her request. \n        Kelly smiled, looking up from the note. She saw Jackie moving around by the door and said, \u201cYes, you can go outside.\u201d Then she heard Jackie run down the stairs, open and close the door. \n        At the age of seven, Jackie was always rearing to go outside, unlike other children these days who stayed in their homes and just played video games. Even though Jackie had a tablet, she hardly ever used it, which was unusual for a child her age, but Kelly was grateful that her child preferred the real over the virtual. \n        Looking at the mail closely, Kelly saw nothing but the usual bills and junk mail until she saw this mysterious letter. It was addressed to her late mother, who had died of breast cancer almost two years ago. Kelly knew she had handled all of her mother\u2019s affairs so who could be sending her mail after so long? \n        Kelly opened it to find a letter inside. It read: \u201cDear Tamara, I\u2019m sorry for all the pain I caused you, but I had to leave for your safety and Kelly\u2019s. It pained me every day to stay away from you. If you are receiving this letter now, I am no longer alive. Here is a check for five hundred thousand dollars. I know this will never make up for what I have done, but I want to make sure that you and Kelly are taken care of. Know that I love you both very much, signed Leroy Jones.\u201d  Kelly looked at the check in astonishment and then the name on the check and the letter from which it came from. \n        Even after Kelly became an adult, her mother would not tell her anything about her father. Whenever the subject was brought up, she would just say that he died a long time ago and that it was too painful to recount the memories of him. Now this letter and this check, what else did her mother hide from her? The even bigger question right now was how did she cash this check? The amount was too big to just go to the bank and cash it, she knew from previous experiences that the bank would only allow her to cash anything less than a thousand dollars. \n        Time had flown by as Kelly did research on how to cash this check when Jackie came flying through the door. \u201cMommy, you are still working? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Kelly looked up from the computer and looked at the time. It was already half past seven, when normally she would have fed Jackie at six o\u2019clock. \n        Kelly got up from her chair and went over to Jackie, \u201cI\u2019m sorry baby, mommy got distracted and let time fly away. Let\u2019s get you something to eat, so you can get ready for bed. You have school in the morning.\u201d Going down the stairs to the kitchen, she looked in the fridge to see what there was to prepare quickly for the hungry child. She decided on something she would never allow Jackie to have on a regular basis. Right now she was so distracted, and she just wanted to feed the child, so she just made her some ramen. \n        Jackie looked at the food and her eyes looked like they were going to explode out of her head with shock. \u201cThank you, Mommy! I love you so much. I hope we have ramen again tomorrow.\u201d \n        Kelly looked at Jackie with a smirk on her face and said, \u201cNot likely honey, today is just one of those days when I just want to give you something you like.\u201d \n        In all honesty, Kelly just wanted the child to not complain. She needed to still figure out what to do about the check she received. Jackie finished her food and Kelly had her clean her bowl and then go take a shower and get ready for bed. After putting Jackie to bed, she went back to her office and continued her research. After a while, she finally found the answer to her question. She would have to open an estate account at the bank. First, she would have to go and see an estate planning attorney to get more information.\n        After dropping Jackie off at school, she went to see an attorney. Walking into the attorney\u2019s office, she was greeted by the secretary. \u201cHello, welcome to Greene and James Law. Do you have an appointment?\u201d\n        Kelly waited to respond because it looked as if the secretary wasn\u2019t quite finished with her greeting. She must have been new to the office because her demeanor looked nervous as she contemplated if she said everything she was supposed to say. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have an appointment. I just had a question about estate planning and wondered if I could just have that answered.\u201d \n        The secretary looked at Kelly and then looked at her computer screen. It looked like she was referring to a script that she had to follow when she finally spoke to say, \u201cWell, you are in luck. Patrick James is available for a walk-in appointment right now if you would like to talk to him. He specializes in estate planning.\u201d\n        \u201cYou can have a seat, while I let Mr. James know you are here. Can I have your name, please?\u201d The secretary asked as she was typing away on her computer. \n        \u201cYes, Kelly Jones.\u201d Kelly went over to the seating area and took a seat. She hoped this would be a one-stop shop, so she could relax. \n        While sitting, her mind began to wander. She thought about the fact that she knew nothing about Leroy, her father, she presumed.         After all, they share the last name, so why not? She wanted to know more about why he left. What he was protecting them from, and where did all of this money come from? The only living person that could give her answers was her aunt Sylvia, but she had been gone for so long touring the world in celebration of her retirement that she didn\u2019t really stay in touch. Once she got home, she would try to contact her aunt to get some answers. \n        Before Kelly could go further into her mind, a man in a suit approached her and introduced himself. \u201cHello, Ms. Jones. I\u2019m Patrick James, estate attorney. Let\u2019s go talk in my office.\u201d Patrick held his hand out to be shaken. At an earlier time Kelly would have refused to shake his hands, but COVID was somewhat a past thought these days. She shook his hand after what seemed like minutes of contemplation, then he escorted her to his office. \n        \u201cHi, Mr. James. I received a letter in the mail addressed to my late mother from my supposedly late father with a check for five hundred thousand dollars. I\u2019m wondering how do I go about getting that money?\u201d Kelly continued her story about not really knowing her father, and how she had a power of attorney over her mother\u2019s estate, but she felt like that wasn\u2019t enough for her to legally cash that check.\n        Patrick listened intently and then said, \u201cYes, you are correct. You need more than your power of attorney to get that money. Although, your power of attorney helps a little bit because you are already an executor of your mother\u2019s estate. However, we would still have to file a petition with the probate court. Have all of your mother\u2019s debts been settled?\u201d\n        Kelly took in everything he was saying and then responded, \u201cYes, she has no debt left to be paid, and I am her only beneficiary.\u201d\n        \u201cPerfect, then that means this process can go a lot quicker than most cases I\u2019ve handled. Your mother had a will, right?\u201d Patrick asked while also taking a look at the paperwork Kelly had handed him. \n        \u201cYes, here it is.\u201d Kelly handed him the document. \n        \u201cAlright, Ms. Jones, here is what we need to do. We will file a petition for probate, then we will go about setting up an estate account for you, which is where the money will be deposited after it goes through probate. We will see how long this will take to go through the courts, but if they are not backed up with cases, then this shouldn\u2019t take longer than four months. We also have to discuss my fee. I charge three thousand dollars for probate petitions. Your case is simple, so you get the discounted price.\u201d Patrick explained the process to Kelly and a load seemed to lift off of her. \n        After meeting with Patrick, Kelly went to the bank to set up an estate account. She went home, still thinking about the backstory between her mother and her estranged father. She called her aunt Sylvia, who told her that her father had left them because he had witnessed a major crime and was put into witness protection afterward. Since no one knew about her and her mother, they were okay to continue their lives as normal. Astonished by the revelation, Kelly just sat in silence until Jackie came in the door. \n        \u201cHi Mommy, how was your day? I had a great day. We made whales.\u201d Jackie held up the contraption that she made that was supposed to be a whale. \n        \u201cMy day was good, baby. I like your whale. Where are you going to put it?\u201d Kelly responded as Jackie sat in her lap. \n        \u201cI was thinking about putting it in your office,\u201d Jackie said as she jumped off of Kelly\u2019s lap in preparation to run up to the office to find the perfect spot to put it among the many projects already in the office.                                 \n        Five months later, the letter she had been waiting for finally came. \n        \u201cMom, the mail is here.\u201d Jackie yelled, then proceeded to run up the stairs to deliver the mail to her mother. Under the door the mail went. \n        \u201cYes, you can go outside. Just don\u2019t forget your jacket and your hat \u2014 it\u2019s cold out.\u201d Kelly responded before getting up from her chair, since she already knew what Jackie wanted.\n        Picking up the mail, the first thing that she saw was a letter from the bank where she set up the estate account. She opened the envelope and looked at the statement that showed the balance. Finally, everything had been processed, and the money had been deposited into the account. \n        Her eyes grew big as tears welled in her eyes. It wasn\u2019t the whole amount of the check since the probate fee was between two and four percent of the estate, and she had paid Patrick James for settling this, but the amount there was still very substantial. After not being able to get a court date for months, she was relieved that it was finally over and now she had the money to prove it.\n\n\n\n"}

Charlie, her eight month-old son, crawled past her. He had recently discovered how to prop open the refrigerator. Last week, he somehow managed to pour a full container of leftover noodles and half a gallon of milk all over himself, so Lindy had to be vigilant whenever he was in the kitchen. She was trying to organize the messy pile of mail that had accumulated on her kitchen table while keeping one eye on Charlie.\n        That was when she found it. Even lying in the cluttered pile of credit card offers and grocery store coupons, the unopened letter had a magical quality to it. The heavy paper stock and light cream color of the envelope made it stand out amongst the brightly colored, cheap flyers. Lindy picked up the letter and examined it.\n        It was addressed to Kevin Ryan. Lindy recognized the name. Kevin was the previous owner of the house, but they\u2019d never met. He had arranged the sale through his lawyer. When she first moved in last year, she noticed that Kevin still had some mail delivered to the house. It was mostly just advertisements, but every month an intricately designed, small-press literary magazine, addressed to Kevin, showed up in her mailbox.  She had never been much of a reader but found herself immersed in this unusual publication and began looking forward to getting the beautifully designed publication each month. She\u2019d done her due diligence and contacted Kevin\u2019s lawyer about the mail, but she\u2019d never heard back.\n        This letter was unlike any she\u2019d seen before. She was taken aback by the beautiful penmanship. She also noticed that the letter had no return address and two stamps. One was a standard American Flag Forever stamp. However, the one next to it was rather remarkable. It had a vintage red background, framing an unusual image of a blue upside-down biplane.\n        She heard Charlie\u2019s giggle and then the sound of her refrigerator opening. She set the letter aside and frantically turned to catch him before he squirted ketchup all over the floor.\n        Later that night, after she\u2019d put Charlie to bed, she stood alone in the kitchen. She could not take her eyes off the unusual letter. It might have just been the moonlight through the window hitting the glossy paper, but it looked as if the envelope glowed with a supernatural light. \n        \u201cRead me,\u201d it seemed to call to her.\n        Lindy knew that it was not only wrong but illegal to open someone else\u2019s mail. She was not usually the kind of person to snoop into other people\u2019s lives. However, before she even registered what she was doing, she found herself gently breaking the seal of the envelope and pulling out the note.\n        Immediately, she was struck by the beauty of the handwriting. But, as soon as she read the first sentence, she hurriedly put the letter back in the envelope. This was not for her eyes. She tried her best to reseal it and stepped away.\n        As she lay in bed that night, the first words of the letter echoed in her head: \u201cMy dearest son, I have one final gift for you.\u201d\n        She knew what she had to do: find Kevin Ryan.\n        The next morning, after she got Charlie off to daycare and was situated at her desk in her office, she looked up Kevin Ryan online. There were thousands of Kevin Ryans, but after doing a little more research, she narrowed it down to about a dozen or so of the most likely candidates and sent messages to them on a variety of social media platforms.\n        Over the next few days, she got a few responses from various Kevins who were not the ones she was searching for. Lindy again contacted Kevin\u2019s lawyer, but she had not been able to track him down. Then, later that week, she checked her mail and saw another issue of the lovely monthly literary magazine that was still being mailed to Kevin. The publication had an editorial address that was just a few blocks away from her office. On her lunch break, she decided to stop by to see if they could track down the elusive Kevin Ryan.\n        When she got to the address on the magazine, she found a surprisingly lavish first-floor office with tall bookshelves covering all the walls. At the desk, a handsome man, who looked to be in his early 60s, was peacefully reading a science fiction novel. When she explained that she was trying to track down a customer named Kevin Ryan, the man smiled warmly. \n        \u201cI\u2019m Kevin,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cI did not expect to find you here!\u201d she laughed. She then showed him the copy of the magazine with his old address. \n        \u201cI completely forgot to cancel my own subscription to my own publication!\u201d he said smiling.\n        Lindy explained who she was and why she was there. Then, she pulled the letter out of her bag and handed it to Kevin. He thanked her and looked down at the handwriting. Tears sprung to his eyes.\n        Lindy explained that she had to get back to work. Kevin, still staring at the letter, murmured a quiet, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n        The next day, Lindy was just getting dinner started in the kitchen when she heard a knock at the door. \n        There was Kevin, holding a bouquet of flowers. \n        \u201cHi. I hope that I am not interrupting. I never got your information. I had to thank you,\u201d he said.\n        Just as she was about to respond, she heard a crash and a cry from the kitchen. Charlie had knocked over an open jar of tomato sauce. \n        \u201cWelcome to my chaos,\u201d she laughed, inviting Kevin in.\n        Over a messy meal of spaghetti, Kevin, Lindy, and Charlie all laughed and joked together. Kevin was impressed with the work Lindy had done on his old home. Charlie was impressed that Kevin gave him a chocolate bar from his briefcase. Lindy was impressed that this warm, older gentleman had brought her flowers. \n        Only after Lindy had washed the sauce out of Charlie\u2019s hair, put him to bed, and poured out two glasses of wine did Kevin and Lindy have a moment to finally talk about the letter. \n        Kevin explained that his mother had passed away several weeks ago. She\u2019d had dementia for years, and it had been a long and brutal parting. Most days, she no longer recognized Kevin. But she had her lucid moments. She\u2019d emerge from her blurry haze and desperately try to tell her son things of \u201cgrave importance.\u201d Most of what she said was incoherent. Right before her death, she told Kevin that she'd \"mailed him an airplane.\" That hadn\u2019t made any sense to him at the time. But, so much of what she said made little sense to him. It was only when Lindy appeared in his office and handed him the letter that he suddenly remembered his mother\u2019s odd remark and finally understood.\n        In her late years, his mother had begun collecting rare objects. He had been worried about her spending. She had been making erratic purchases. However, before he was able to step in and help manage her finances, she'd spent her life savings on a stamp collection. After her death, he had the stamps appraised, and there was nothing of value. However, as soon as Lindy handed him his mother\u2019s letter, he recognized the strange stamp on the envelope. He explained that it was an \u201cInverted Jenny\u201d, one of the rarest stamps in US postal history. It was printed in 1918 and featured the Curtiss JN-4, America's most famous World War I aircraft. This stamp was a rare misprint. Only one pane of one hundred inverted stamps was ever found.\n        \u201cHow much is it worth?\u201d Lindy asked, amazed.\n        \u201cAlmost a million dollars,\u201d Kevin said calmly.\n        \u201cWow. I\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t toss it out with the junk mail,\u201d Lindy laughed. She could not process this news.\n        \u201cLindy, I want to share the money with you,\u201d Kevin said. \n        \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused.\n        \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do what you did. You could have thrown that letter away or kept it for yourself,\u201d he said warmly.\n        \u201cKevin. No. That is too much. I can\u2019t,\u201d she said calmly.\n        \u201cWhen my mother passed, that was the end of any family that I have. I've lived a solitary life. I have my books and my pets. But I have no one else to share this money with. I looked you up. I read about the fire and your husband. I am so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine. You and Charlie are alone in the world, too. I think my mother may have connected us for a reason,\u201d Kevin said calmly.\n        Lindy looked at Kevin dumbstruck. She knew this man was in earnest.\n        \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d she asked quietly.\n        \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, smiling.\n        \u201cWhat did your mother write to you in the letter?\u201d\n        He took the beautiful envelope from his pocket. She looked at the stamp in disbelief. He handed her the envelope, pulled out the letter, and began to read."}

In 1967, I was an eight-year-old boy living with my mom, dad, and sister in a suburb just outside Montpelier, Vermont. My Dad owned the local hardware store, and my mom worked as a nurse at a nearby clinic. Dad was a veteran of World War II. He had turned 18 one week before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He and his friends immediately signed up for the Navy and were shipped out a few months later. Dad served predominantly in the Pacific theater on various naval battleships. He then came home and married Mom.\n        Dad took over the family hardware store when his dad retired and helped put my mother through nursing school. Pretty soon they were the cookie-cutter family with two kids, a house with a fence, and a basset hound named Spud. \n        Dad never talked much about his time in the war, but he did spend every Friday night with some of his veteran friends at the local American Legion chapter house. My sister, Jenny, had just completed her senior year of high school and was working at a local grocery store as a clerk. She had big plans to save up money over the year to start college the following autumn. She was also head over heels in love with her high school sweetheart, Danny Cooper.\n        Danny and Jenny were an odd couple, to say the least. My sister was part of the \u201cin crowd\u201d at school. She was a member of the cheerleading squad and excelled in all of her classes. Danny was part of the artsy clique. He was not a strong student, but he did have a gift for the visual arts. His talents ranged from painting and sculpting to woodworking, but his real talent was photography. He had a gift for finding the perfect light and perspective to capture a moment or a person with the click of a camera button.\n        Life was simple in my world up until that fateful year in 1967. One Saturday afternoon in February, after finishing her shift at the grocery store, my sister came into the house crying. I was sitting on the couch, trying in vain to teach Spud how to stand on two legs while balancing a ruler on his nose. Jenny ran up the stairs to her room, and my mother followed her. I stayed on the couch, figuring it was probably boy trouble, and continued my canine training program with Spud.\n        My mother came down a few minutes later. I asked her what was wrong with Jenny, and she sat down next to me on the couch, petting Spud\u2019s soft, fluffy ears as she spoke. She explained to me that Danny\u2019s draft number had come up. This meant that the government needed him to go and fight in the Vietnam War. I did not know a lot about this war. I knew it was in a place very far away. Likewise, I knew that my sister had several classmates who had already gone there. And I knew that one of those classmates never came back home. My mother told me to try not to ask my sister about Danny for now, as she was going to miss him very much. I agreed and went back to my dog lessons.\n        Danny came and said goodbye to Jenny the morning before he was shipped out to basic training. He was a small but handsome teenager on the cusp of manhood. He had dark hair and deep green eyes. He was lean in build and always wore a clean, white t-shirt with his slacks. My Dad always told Jenny she should question Danny\u2019s artistic sense since he always seemed to wear the same, plain attire. But Jenny would defend Danny, saying he simply devoted all of his free time to artistic endeavors, saving his creative talents for things much more important than wardrobe choices. \n        My dad was not a fan of Danny from the start. He believed that all of this could have been avoided if Danny had worked harder to make good grades in school. That way, he could have gotten into college and avoided the draft altogether. But on this day, seeing Danny awkwardly standing on the stoop as my sister sobbed in his arms, my dad showed his softer side. He went to Danny and shook his hand, telling him he was proud of his service and wishing him luck. Danny then gave my sister a final hug and kiss. He lugged his backpack over his shoulder and walked off down the street toward the bus station.\n        Danny returned once more for a weekend visit, just before being sent out on his first tour of duty. His dark hair had been shaved down in the required crew cut, and he looked more muscular, but otherwise he seemed to be the same old Danny. \n        That Sunday, Danny and Jenny went to the courthouse and got married. They came home and told my parents, who said very little. With Danny leaving to fight overseas, they did not feel it would be appropriate to protest. \n        The summer months came and went. I spent them playing baseball with friends, riding bikes, and rereading the Hardy Boys books I had gotten for my birthday the previous year. Jenny received letters from Danny every week.\n        On September 12, at around 6:30 pm, I was sitting with my dad watching television while my mother cooked dinner. We heard a sharp knock at the door. My dad opened the door to find a man in a military uniform standing on the front stoop with a white letter in his hand. He asked if Jenny Cooper was at home. I still had not gotten used to my sister\u2019s new last name. Dad told him that Jenny was at work and would not be home until late tonight. The officer handed Dad the letter, and requested that he give it to Jenny once she got home. Then, he saluted us and walked back down the drive to his car parked on the side of the street.\n        It seemed like my father stood in the open doorway, bathed in twilight, for hours, but I knew it was only a few minutes. He turned and saw my mother now standing in the living room, her fingers pressed firmly against her lips as if suppressing a cry. \n        Dad looked over at my mom and said, \u201cHoney, you know I have to open this. I want to be prepared for whatever is inside once Jenny gets home.\u201d\n        My mother nodded. She walked over and put her arm around me, clutching me tight in a protective gesture as my father opened the envelope. I had no idea at the time what might be in the envelope, but years later I found out that a major battle had taken place in north Vietnam the previous week and that several boys from our county had been involved in it. \n        My dad expected to open the envelope and find a letter stating that Danny Cooper had been killed in action. Instead, a bronze star medal fell out and into my father\u2019s cupped hand. The letter gave no explanation for the award, only that Danny Cooper had earned the medal for committing acts of valor in the heat of battle. When Jenny got home, she lovingly placed the medal in her jewelry box.\n        The months passed by quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the school year was at an end. It was the beginning of summer, 1968, and Danny finally came home. We went with Jenny and Danny\u2019s parents to pick him up from the bus station in town. \n        When he stepped off the Greyhound, we hardly recognized him. His hair was shaggy, and he had grown a beard. He was gaunt, and though he had been lean even before joining the army, his features seemed sharper. We each hugged Danny, but he looked stiff and awkward until he hugged Jenny. Then he melted into her arms. \n        Within a few weeks, Jenny had moved out of my parent\u2019s home and into an apartment on the other side of town. Much to my parents' dismay, their apartment was not in the best part of town. The apartment was also rundown, with cracked windows and a leaky roof. But Jenny seemed not to care. She was merely elated to have Danny back in her life.\n        During that summer, Danny was incredibly quiet. He had trouble finding work and looked disheveled. He refused to shave, even for job interviews. He said that he had promised a friend of his back in Vietnam that he would come home and never shave again. According to Danny, the friend never got that option, as he died a few months before their tour of duty was up. \n        One balmy June night, my parents had Jenny and Danny over for dinner. We were all sitting around our large kitchen table. The adults in the room were eating my mom\u2019s famous meatloaf and chatting about Jenny\u2019s plans to enroll in the teaching college in the next town over. I was also sitting at the table, bored with the conversation and listlessly thumbing at my bag of marbles in my lap. I placed the bag on the table as I stood up to reach for another slice of meatloaf. And then it happened.\n        The marbles rolled carelessly out of their leather pouch. They skittered and fell over the edge of the table and onto the tiles, emanating a sharp and symmetrical cracking sound as they hit the floor. In what seemed like only seconds, Danny stood up from his chair, flipping it backwards against the dining room hutch. He lunged under the table, dislodging the pitcher of iced tea, which smashed on the ground. We gasped, and Jenny immediately knelt down, asking Danny what was wrong. \n        Danny was curled up under the table, his knees held tightly to his chest, and his eyes bulging. He seemed to be muttering, \u201cNo. No. No. No\u201d over and over again while rocking slightly on his heels. Jenny tried to pull Danny by the arm out from under the table, but he screamed out an animal, guttural cry in response.\n        My mother said to my father in a panic, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d as my sister sobbed into her arms. \n        My dad said, \u201cTake Jack and Jenny out of the room, please.\u201d\n        My mom did as she was asked, but barely. I was told to go to my room, but everyone was so shocked by what had just happened that I stood behind Jenny and my Mom in the living room unnoticed.\n        My dad kicked aside a few of the large pieces of the broken pitcher. He then ducked underneath the table and sat down right next to Danny in a puddle of iced tea. My father was a rigid man who showed few emotions. But at that moment, he wrapped his arm around Danny, and I could hear him say with a tremble in his voice, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, son. We are home now. We are home.\u201d \n        After that night, Danny still struggled to deal with the aftermath of his wartime service. But it felt like the beginning of something new. He and my father would take long walks together on Sundays, and they both came back seeming a bit lighter for it. That summer, I learned that no matter how much you love a person, you can\u2019t take away their pain like magic. But you can make the pain feel less heavy by sitting with it right alongside them.\n"}

They\u2019d finished their homework a few minutes ago, and had been about to start making themself lunch. But the one rule they\u2019d had drummed into their head throughout their magical education was that leaving a spell unfinished was a recipe for disaster, even more so since their first year at Two Moons University.\n        Two Moons University was one of the most prestigious and exclusive magical universities in the country. You had to have excellent marks throughout middle and high school, show aptitude for the four primary forms of magic \u2013 Transformation, Healing, Illusion, and Elemental \u2013 and pass a grueling entrance exam to boot.\n        It made for an extremely competitive environment and a great deal of friction between people who\u2019d been the big fish in their little ponds back in high school, only to discover they were medium-sized fish here.\n        This was Beckett\u2019s third year at the university, and they\u2019d kept their head down through most of it, sticking to their studies and planning for graduate school. They\u2019d hoped Two Moons would have been better than their high school; instead, it had been worse. The in-groups were more vicious, the out-groups more defensive, and the professors turned a blind eye to everything that didn\u2019t involve actual harm or irreversible effects.\n        They\u2019d considered dropping out more than once, but if you had a degree from Two Moons, you could pretty much write your own offer letters to any business or organization. Plus, Trina was their best friend and roommate, and they didn\u2019t want to abandon her, especially when one of the most popular and protected girls at the school had decided Trina made a good target.\n        Lacey came from Blackthorne, one of the most elite academies in the country. Wealth and power were always a potent combination, and in her case, Lacey had used them during her first semester to climb to the top of the social ladder and rule over the student body like an empress. Anyone else was either in good with her, or did their best to stay out of her line of sight.\n        Unfortunately, Trina had missed that memo, and corrected Lacey in one of their Transformation classes during the second half of their first year. The fact that Trina was right didn\u2019t matter to Lacey. What mattered was that someone had contradicted her. So she decided to make Trina\u2019s life a misery, all while maintaining an air of innocence whenever Trina complained to the faculty. It didn\u2019t help that every incident could be explained away as an honest mistake, a coincidence, or an accident.\n        Beckett had been paired with Trina at the beginning of their third year, and the two of them shared Beckett\u2019s off-campus, university-run apartment. One of the housing administrators quietly told Beckett that they were probably the safest option out of all the placements, unofficially acknowledging that even the authorities had noted how Lacey treated Trina.\n        Trina had tried apologizing to Lacey, ignoring her, groveling to her, and using protective magics. She\u2019d confided in Beckett that she was getting to the point of attempting retaliation, but that was out of desperation instead of a hope that it would make Lacey back down.\n        So the two of them were very cautious when it came to surprises in their lives. Lacey hadn\u2019t tried anything against Beckett, recognizing them as a better mage than her, and had stayed away from the shared apartment for the same reason. But Beckett knew it was a matter of when and not if Lacey would take her vengeance against Trina.\n        Therefore, Beckett braced themself and opened the front door of their shared apartment. Looking around, there wasn\u2019t anyone there, or anywhere down the hall, but glancing down they saw an envelope placed in the exact middle of the welcome mat. \u201cTrina\u201d was written on the cream white rectangle in a fancy script, with no other identifying markings or any indication of where or who it might have come from.\n        Beckett sighed, and refocused their vision to invoke their divination magic. They were one of the best students in that particular track, with consistent, excellent marks, but almost nobody outside the Divination school took it seriously. Almost all the students at the university assumed it was only about reading the future, which was generally considered a pointless endeavor, so they wanted to work with more interesting forms of magic.\n        However, Beckett and the other divination students knew better. They learned how to read the flows of magic, identify spell signatures, and determine what a spell was meant to do. And that was only in the first year. After that, they got even deeper into divination magic.\n        This was how they knew that the letter was from Lacey, that it contained a compulsion charm to pick up and open the letter, and that there was a nasty curse meant to strike whoever opened it. They would be struck with a transformation spell that was meant to be irreversible. Tendrils of spell energy were already spilling out from the letter, looking for a target, and if they shut the door, some unprepared student from elsewhere in the complex would be snared by the curse. \n        Before reaching down, they cast a message spell that would go to the Dean of the Divination school. In the message, they embedded their impressions of the harmful magic letter, and added a request for curse-breaking. Then, they released the message. The spell complete, the message took the form of a tiny red sphere, zipped through the ceiling and presumably flew off to wherever the Dean was on a Saturday afternoon.\n        \u201cTrina!\u201d Beckett called. \u201cDon\u2019t come out until I tell you to!\u201d Their only hope was that since the curse was so specifically targeted to Trina, it wouldn\u2019t strongly affect a different target. That, and they had built up some resistance to Transformation magic cast by others.\n        In their last act before picking up the letter, they cast a small spell that closed and locked the door to Trina\u2019s room. No sense in her getting any of this backlash, they thought grimly.\n        The letter practically leapt into their hand thanks to the compulsion aspect of the curse. They shut the front door, turned the envelope over, and broke the seal, removing the single sheet of paper inside as the curse began to unfold. Better me, Beckett thought to themself, than Trina or anybody else who\u2019d have more trouble resisting it.\n        As the magic of the curse began to sink into Beckett, they read the note with a certain amount of curiosity, but the only words on the paper were, \u201cFrom a secret admirer.\u201d\n        Beckett rolled their eyes. Did Lacey ever outgrow high school?\n        The curse, now thoroughly active, began working changes in Beckett\u2019s body. They felt hair sprout from every part of their skin as their skeleton and muscles were reshaped. The curse didn\u2019t include anything to counter the pain of the transformation, so Beckett did their level best to keep their voice down. \n        \u201cBeckett! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Trina called from her room. \u201cWhy\u2019d you lock me in?\u201d\n        Blast it, Beckett thought, she didn\u2019t hear anything other than the doorbell. Here\u2019s hoping she doesn\u2019t leave her room unprotected before the curse is done.\n        The physical aspect of the curse was nearly done, and Beckett had a fairly good idea of what Lacey had intended for Trina. They were now down on their hands which had turned into paws. A weirdly long tail snaked out of their clothing, and their sense of smell and hearing enhanced. They suspected they were somewhere between a cat, a rat, and a dog.\n        Unimaginative, Lacey, he thought savagely. This is like the worst possible transformation accident a middle schooler might have, but Two Moons wouldn\u2019t accept you if you were this unskilled - even with what looked to be a master-level transformation spell. I know you don\u2019t respect Trina, but her teachers do.\n        The physical transformation finished, but the rest of the curse still hung in the air. Beckett stared up into the still present strands of magic, pleased that they retained all of their powers, and smirked a bit. \n        The curse had clearly been tailor-made for Trina, specifically, and was meant to transform both her body and her mind. Because Beckett had taken the spell, the mental portion of the curse was easier to ward off. Trina and Beckett\u2019s minds were different, so the curse had trouble implementing the mental changes.\n        But the moment Trina stepped out of her room, the second part of the curse would latch on to her. \n        \u201cBeckett!\u201d Trina yelled. They could more clearly hear her through the door, and recognized equal parts fear and worry.\n        They tried to speak, and managed, \u201cLacey trouble!\u201d Then the curse flared and changed their vocal cords so that only barks and hisses emerged.\n        But Trina had heard enough, and as Beckett turned to face her door, they saw a spell shield form. The shield zoomed toward them and enveloped both them and the lingering pieces of the curse in a bubble of magic. They relaxed. Trina\u2019s defensive spells had improved significantly since Lacey had started targeting her, and now the curse wouldn\u2019t be able to latch on to their roommate. \n        Trina emerged cautiously from her room with a second defensive spell at the ready. When she saw Beckett on the floor, she used a few choice swear words before asking, \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n        Beckett shook their head, which felt oddly shaped, and pointed to the paper on the floor inside the bubble.\n        \u201cFrom a secret admirer? What is she, twelve?\u201d Trina muttered as she read the note. \u201cCan you still do magic?\u201d When Beckett nodded, she continued, \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t use the letter or the envelope to talk to me, but I think the Ghostly Writing spell should be fine?\u201d\n        Beckett wanted to grin, but their face wouldn\u2019t quite move the right way. With a claw tipped forefinger, they wrote out what had happened, so Trina knew not to open the bubble. \n        Trina asked with honest confusion, \u201cDid she think that nobody would figure this out?\u201d\n        Beckett wrote in reply, \u201cShe probably figured she could blame it on another accident. The curse was irreversible and supposed to dissipate quickly after it had done its work. It was meant to look like you tried a powerful Transformation and failed.\u201d\n        There was a polite knock at the door, followed by the voice of the Dean of Divination. \u201cBeckett,\u201d she said, \u201cI got your message. Credendo quis videt.\u201d\n        Beckett nodded at Trina. The unofficial motto of the Divination school, translated as \u201cBy believing, one sees\u201d; a subtle reference that nobody outside the school would know, and therefore an unofficial password.\n        When Trina opened the door, the Dean swept in, followed by two mages Beckett had never seen before. \n        Trina bowed, saying, \u201cWelcome, Dean Montellier.\u201d\n        \u201cPlease, let us not stand on formality while one of my best students is in this condition,\u201d she responded. \u201cMy colleagues are Inquisitor March and Inquisitor Wells, part of the Two Moons University Student Conduct Office.\u201d Whistling, she added, \u201cAnd I see the nature of the problem. Excellent shield work, Trina Montefort. I can find no flaw in your spell.\u201d \n        She then turned to Beckett and smiled, while Trina blushed at the unexpected compliment. \u201cI see your selfless nature has once again asserted itself. Worry not. The incomplete curse should be easy to unravel, especially as it did not reach your friend. And this gives us more than enough evidence to punish Lacey Davenport appropriately. Though that is not your concern at the moment.\u201d\n        Beckett wrote in the air, \u201cShe\u2019s vengeful, and she has powerful parents.\u201d\n        The Dean smiled. \u201cHer parents are not as powerful as the Mages\u2019 Council. You and Trina will be protected, though it is likely her parents will try to keep the matter quiet.\u201d She turned to the two mages with her, and asked, \u201cDo you have sufficient evidence? And if so, can you remove the curse from my student, Beckett Allister?\u201d\n        One of the mages stepped forward and bowed. \u201cWe do, and I will. This was a nasty piece of work, meant to simulate a failed master-rank Transformation, body and mind. Thankfully, it is quite simple to unravel an incomplete curse.\u201d \n        For a few moments, everything was still, and then the mage ruefully chuckled. \u201cStudent Montefort,\u201d they said, \u201cwould you please remove the shield? My colleague will protect you from the irreversible effects while I deal with the curse.\u201d\n        Twenty minutes later, the Inquisitors were gone, Beckett was restored to their normal self, and Dean Montellier sat at the kitchen table, sipping hot tea. Trina stared into her cup for several moments before saying, \u201cThis was not how I wanted to spend my Saturday.\u201d\n\n"}

I\u2019m up!\u201d he said. \n        Olivia shook her head. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s time to go. Did you brush your teeth?\u201d Caleb nodded groggily, following Olivia down the hall to the front door. \n        After she dropped Caleb off at school, Olivia returned to the house. She had a whole list of things to do: go through the stack of mail, pay bills, and order groceries. She figured she should tackle the mail first. They hadn\u2019t gone through any of it since before their vacation, and that had been over a week ago. Most of it was credit card offers and coupons, but there might be something important in the pile.\n        Olivia poured herself a cup of coffee and then brought the mail over to the little side table. She took a seat in her favorite overstuffed chair, took a sip of coffee, and got to work. \n        Just as she had suspected, the majority of it was junk, but there was a thin letter on the bottom of the pile with no return address. \n        Hmm. That was odd. It was addressed to her husband, Patrick, and the address was handwritten. \n        Olivia shrugged, assuming it was probably from Patrick\u2019s sister, who lived out of state. Patrick never liked to be bothered with the minutiae of the day-to-day, so Olivia felt no guilt as she sliced the envelope with her letter opener and slid out the single sheet of paper inside.\n        As she read the contents, her mouth dropped open. She let the letter drop to her lap as she sat, dumbfounded. Patrick had a daughter? An eighteen-year-old daughter? How did he not know about her? Why had this girl or her mother not reached out before now? Olivia felt sick, like her entire world was being flipped on its head.\n        She reached for her mug with a trembling hand but couldn\u2019t bring it to her lips without spilling, so she set it back down. She picked the letter up again, reading it a second time. The girl hadn\u2019t said much, just that she was Patrick\u2019s daughter, that her mother was Sarah (the woman Patrick had dated all through high school), and that the girl, Kate, needed to meet with him about something urgent. \n        What could be more urgent than \u201chey, it\u2019s me, your surprise kid\u201d? Olivia didn\u2019t know. She grabbed her phone from the table, searched for Patrick\u2019s contact, and hit the call button.\n        \u201cHey, Liv, what\u2019s up?\u201d he answered. \n        Olivia cleared her throat and tried to speak clearly, but her voice was barely audible as she said, \u201cCan you come home for lunch today?\u201d \n        She could hear the alarm in Patrick\u2019s voice as he asked, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong? Is it Caleb?\u201d \n        Olivia shook her head, then realized Patrick couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cNo, Caleb is fine. Please just come home as soon as you can.\u201d \n        \u201cI\u2019m coming now,\u201d Patrick replied, and they ended the call.\n        Olivia set her phone back down on the table and then took her coffee cup to the sink. She tossed out the junk mail and set Kate\u2019s letter on the counter. She wished she hadn\u2019t opened Patrick\u2019s mail. She wished she didn\u2019t know this information and didn\u2019t have to be the one to share it with her husband.\n        She and Patrick had met nearly fifteen years ago at a charity event that his law firm was hosting. She had gone there with a date, one of Patrick\u2019s partners at the firm, but he was a bore, and Olivia felt zero guilt about ditching him and spending the evening with Patrick. They had clicked instantly. \n        From that day forward, they were inseparable. They told each other everything. Olivia knew all about Sarah, Patrick\u2019s high school sweetheart. They had dated for four years and ended things amicably when Patrick went off to college across the country. Patrick wasn\u2019t a social media person, so Olivia had never worried about Sarah reaching out or trying to reconnect now that they had relocated back to Patrick\u2019s hometown. Besides, Olivia was confident in their relationship. She had no reason to think that Patrick would be in contact with an ex without telling her. \n        When Patrick arrived home twenty minutes later, Olivia had managed to calm down a little. She was still rattled, but she knew that Patrick hadn\u2019t known about Kate (the letter had confirmed this), and she was confident that they could get through this. \n        \u201cOlivia, what\u2019s going on? You sounded weird on the phone.\u201d \n        Olivia took a deep breath and slid the letter across the counter to him. Patrick looked at it, confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d \n        Olivia pushed it closer. \u201cJust read it,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. Patrick picked the paper up, and, as he read, Olivia watched the understanding and disbelief cloud his eyes. \n        \u201cIs this real?\u201d he finally asked, setting the letter back down. Olivia nodded. \n        Patrick sighed. \u201cWhoa. I don\u2019t know what to say. Can I just process for a minute?\u201d He sat down at the kitchen table, his hands clasped together, silently staring at nothing in particular. \n        Finally, after what felt like forever, he took a deep breath. \u201cOlivia, the first thing I need to know is\u2014 are we okay?\u201d Olivia nodded, reaching for his hand as she took a seat next to him. \n        Patrick breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cOkay. Good. Okay. We can handle this, right? Okay.\u201d \n        Olivia smiled, laughing softly. \u201cYou said \u2018okay\u2019 a lot there. Are you sure it\u2019s okay?\u201d \n        Patrick laughed, squeezing Olivia\u2019s hand gently. \u201cWell, I guess I should reach out to her, right? See what\u2019s so urgent? I mean, obviously I want to meet her regardless, but this letter definitely makes it seem like there\u2019s a time-sensitive matter at hand.\u201d \n        Well, I'm the only one on fiction right now, so it's me for Team Fiction. lolPatrick ran his hands through his hair. \u201cI just can\u2019t work out why Sarah didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cShe\u2019s my child. I should\u2019ve known about her!\u201d \n        Olivia nodded, squeezing his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sweetie. And this is something that you will have to address with Sarah. But, it isn\u2019t Kate\u2019s fault, so let\u2019s try to set that aside for right now and see what Kate has to say.\u201d Patrick nodded, reaching for his phone. \n        His hands quivered as he punched in the number written at the bottom of the letter. Olivia sat listening as he identified himself and made plans for Kate to come to their house for dinner the following evening.\n        When he hung up the phone, Olivia looked at him curiously. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to meet somewhere more, I don\u2019t know, neutral?\u201d she asked. \n        Patrick shrugged. \u201cShe said it was a private matter that she needed to discuss, and she asked to come here.\u201d \n        \u201cAnd how are you feeling?\u201d \n        \u201cI don\u2019t even think I can identify it. Nervous, excited, shocked, happy, scared.\u201d\n        Olivia pulled him to her, hugging him tightly and kissing his cheek. She pressed her forehead to his. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she reassured him.\n        The following evening, Olivia was dressed in her favorite outfit \u2014 a pair of high-waisted black leggings, a fitted black tee, and an oversized open-front cardigan with a beautiful abstract floral design. She wanted to appear approachable, kind, and welcoming, and she hoped this outfit conveyed all of that. She applied minimal makeup and fixed her hair in soft waves. Patrick was sitting on the edge of their bed, running his hands through his hair manically. \n        \u201cWhat if she hates me? What if she resents me for not being in her life all this time?\u201d \n        Olivia took a seat next to him, pulling his hands from his hair and holding them in her own. \u201cThe only thing you can control is yourself. So, don\u2019t panic about anything outside your control.\u201d\n        Patrick smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not my fault that I wasn\u2019t there\u2014 I didn\u2019t even know she existed until yesterday. Thank you, sweetheart.\u201d He kissed her cheek and walked to the closet to change. \n        They had sent Caleb to a friend\u2019s house for a sleepover. Although Kate was his sister and he would hopefully meet her eventually, Olivia and Patrick had agreed that this initial meeting should just be the three of them. They didn\u2019t know what Kate wanted or needed, and they thought it best to keep Caleb out of it until they knew more.\n        Olivia hadn\u2019t felt calm enough to cook dinner, so she ordered in from the local Chinese restaurant. She knew nothing about Kate or her eating habits, so she got a little of everything, making sure that some options were vegetarian and vegan. She heard the doorbell and took a deep breath.\n        \u201cPatrick!\u201d she called toward their bedroom. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d \n        Patrick emerged, looking terrified. Olivia laughed. \u201cCheck your face!\u201d she said. Patrick rubbed a hand across his face, laughing nervously. \n        He walked to the door and opened it. On the step stood a carbon copy of Patrick, except for her long, sun-streaked blonde hair. \n        \u201cWhoa,\u201d Patrick breathed, staring at her. Kate smiled timidly back at him. \n        \u201cCould I come in?\u201d she asked. \n        \u201cOh! Of course, please,\u201d Patrick said, stepping to the side and gesturing toward their living room. Kate stepped inside, looking around at her surroundings. \n        \u201cYour home is beautiful,\u201d she said to them. \n        Olivia smiled kindly. \u201cThank you so much. Kate, it\u2019s lovely to meet you. I\u2019m Patrick\u2019s wife, Olivia.\u201d She extended her hand, and Kate shook it briefly. \n        \u201cThank you for having me,\u201d she said. \n        Olivia gestured toward the couch. \u201cPlease, have a seat. Would you like something to drink?\u201d \n        \u201cWater would be lovely, thank you.\u201d \n        When Olivia returned with the glass, Kate took it gratefully and took a big gulp. \n        \u201cWould you like to eat?\u201d Patrick asked nervously, taking a seat beside Olivia and clutching her hand. \n        \u201cActually, I would like to talk first,\u201d Kate said, taking a deep breath. Patrick nodded, remaining silent. \n        \u201cI know I just met you. And I hope we have time in the future to get to know one another better and that we can be in each other\u2019s lives. I genuinely want that,\u201d Kate said, the words rushing out of her. \u201cBut I have a bit of an important request, and quite frankly, I can\u2019t be polite and wait an appropriate amount of time before asking.\u201d \n        Patrick nodded, encouraging her to continue. \n        \u201cI have end-stage kidney disease, and I need a kidney transplant. My blood type is not compatible with my mom's. The doctor said I have to have the same blood type as at least one of my biological parents, so that means you should have the same blood type as me. Which means you should be a compatible match to donate a kidney.\u201d Kate took a deep breath and a long drink of water before continuing.\n        \u201cWithout a new kidney, my doctors only give me a few weeks. So, as you can see, this is a very important thing, which is why I couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d Finally, Kate finished talking and looked at Patrick, her eyes wide and hopeful.\n        Patrick rubbed his hands down his face, trying to process all that Kate had just shared. \n        \u201cI just have one question,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t your mom tell me about you? Why am I just now getting a chance to know you after all these years?\u201d \n        Kate smiled sorrowfully. \u201cShe found out she was pregnant the summer after graduation, when you were getting ready to start your full-ride scholarship more than two thousand miles away. She knew a baby would derail everything and that you would insist on staying close by and helping. She didn\u2019t want to upset your plans like that.\u201d \n        Patrick slammed his fist on the arm of the couch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kate, I don\u2019t mean to take anything out on you. I just wish your mom would\u2019ve allowed me to make that decision for myself. I\u2026 I\u2019m just sorry I missed out on so many years of your life.\u201d \n        Olivia squeezed his arm, and Patrick looked over at her. Her face was streaked with tears that continued to splash down her cheeks and into her lap. \n        \u201cPatrick. You need to talk to Sarah and work through all of that. But Kate has a bigger issue at hand,\u201d she said quietly. \n        Patrick nodded. \u201cThis is a big deal, Olivia. Can we go into the kitchen and discuss?\u201d \n        Kate waved them away, her eyes still wide and hopeful, as Olivia followed Patrick into the next room. \n        \u201cDo you think I should do this?\u201d he asked. \n        \u201cWhat other option do you have, Patrick? She\u2019s your child, and she needs your help.\u201d \n        Patrick squeezed her hand gratefully, and the two returned to the living room. \n        Sitting down opposite Kate, Patrick smiled at her as he asked, \u201cWhen can we get this scheduled?\u201d"}

Finally, I\u2019m in the zone, and getting it done. When, out of the blue, a sharp insistent knocking followed by the frenzied barking of my dog dramatically interrupts my progress. I spill my coffee over everything. Everything! My notes are blurring into squiggles of blue under the tan liquid of my coffee. Luckily, my laptop is elevated and not subject to the flood of coffee overtaking everything on my desk. It\u2019s also on my shirt. Wonderful.\n        I rush to the door, trying to clip my hair and look less flustered. Look at me in my yoga pants and baggy sweatshirt that now has coffee stains on it. I look totally presentable. I gently push my dog aside as I open the door just a crack. \n        Before I can say anything, the stranger standing there, looking like a tall zombie with dark circles under his eyes, thrusts an envelope into my hand, then makes an about-face and marches away. Normally, I would have yelled after him trying to elicit some information about this letter, but I am exhausted. There is coffee to clean up, and a presentation to write. \n        Moreover, I really can\u2019t deal with this today. I'm exhausted. Clearly, I have not had my coffee yet. In fact, at this moment it is all over my desk. I go into the kitchen and throw the envelope on the table. I grab some paper towels off the counter and make my way to the study in hopes of salvaging some of my notes. What a brilliant start to the day. It is only 8:32 am, and I want to cry. \n        At least it\u2019s Friday. I clean my desk. The entire room smells like coffee. I can\u2019t stand that, as much as I love coffee. So, now I have to use bleach wipes to sanitize my desk, and light some lavender scented candles to restore a sense of balance to my workspace. \n        My dog decides to help by stealing a coffee soaked paper towel from the trash bin. I try to get it, and she runs. I chase after her only to find my beloved dog gulping it before I can take it away. No good will come of this. I hope she doesn\u2019t get sick. So, I realize with great resignation, it is going to be one of those days. I go into the kitchen and fix another cup of coffee for myself. My dog is begging for a treat, like she deserves it after the paper towel debacle. Nevertheless, I give her a treat and take some aspirin. She wants some of that too. I tell her it is a mommy treat, not for dogs. She is disgruntled, and it shows on her expressive labrador retriever face. \n        I sit down at the table, waiting for the aspirin to show any signs of working on my pounding headache. Taking a few sips of coffee, I start to relax, and then my eyes gaze upon the letter, the cursed letter that started this ghastly chain of events, just lying on the table ever so innocently. I should throw it away. \n        Perhaps, I should be more worried about the letter, but this is just the type of thing my friends would send me as punishment for not returning their calls. I\u2019m not sure what part of I have a deadline they don\u2019t understand. But, I love them anyway. \n        Staring at the letter of the damned, I sip some more coffee. Finally, I pick up the envelope. It is tan colored with no name or return address on the front. On the back it is closed by red sealing wax with the image of a thistle upon it. Yes, the thistle, a shared symbol between my friends and I. I love sealing cards with wax, and so last year I gave all of my friends matching thistle wax and seal sets since they get excited about getting cards from me. We became friends in a Scottish history course, so the thistle is fitting. \n        That said, given the morning I have already had, if this letter actually is cursed, I would not be surprised. I probably should just throw out this mystery delivered by the zombie man, but I find that I am too curious to do so. If my friends did send it, they put in a lot of effort and drama to get it to me. I\u2019m not in my study, so if it\u2019s a glitter bomb or something equally vile, only the kitchen table, the floor, myself, and the dog will be collateral damage. It would be just like my friends to send me an exploding letter, and then laugh when I describe it falling all over the dog.  The thought of having to give the dog a bath because she has been glittered strikes terror into my heart. I give her a chew treat so that she will run out of the room to her bed, where she likes to work on her bones.\n        I\u2019m now ready to face opening the envelope. Breaking the red seal, I pull out the parchment like card from inside. In black letters it reads: Luna's, 6:30pm, dress code: jeans. Don\u2019t make us come and get you! \n        I can\u2019t make out the handwriting. However, I assume this is some prank by one of my friends. Don\u2019t make us come and get you, is something they always say to me after I decline one of their invitations. They have been after me to come out and have drinks with them on a Friday night. On the other hand, couldn\u2019t they have just called me? Ok, so I don\u2019t answer my phone, but there is always the old reliable text message. \n        Reluctantly, I go back to my study. There is enough time to decide what to do with the strange invitation once I am finished preparing the presentation. Moreover, since it probably is from my friends, I decide that after all this drama leaving them hanging about my response is somewhat justified. Time passes and I realize it is 4:30pm. I missed lunch, as usual. I turn my computer off and go back to the kitchen. \n        The letter is on the table where I left it. Do I have anything better to do tonight? No. What can the harm be, really? Luna\u2019s is a pub not too far from here. It is not like the letter is asking me to go down a dark alley. Plus, Luna\u2019s has great spinach and artichoke dip, and I\u2019m hungry. \n        I decide that I am going to Luna\u2019s. But, first, I need to walk the dog, and take a shower. Before leaving the house, I take one last look at myself; hair neatly in a clip, jeans, and a clean sweatshirt. I grab my bag, and depart. \n        I walk a couple blocks to the subway station and make my way to the train. It is only a ten-minute ride to my stop. I get out and walk toward Luna\u2019s. As I approach, I see the zombie person who delivered the envelope this morning sitting in a chair next to the door. He sees me, gets up, and then goes into Luna\u2019s.\n        Perhaps I should turn around and go home, I muse.  My stomach growls. I\u2019m seriously hungry now, and it\u2019s not like the bartender is going to let a zombie man harass me. I\u2019ll just have to be careful on my way home, so I\u2019m not followed. Maybe I\u2019ll splurge and take a cab, just to be safe. At least that gets me home with the doors locked, and I have my dog as a protector. Satisfied by my hunger laced reasoning, I walk to the door.\n        I open the heavy wooden door and to my surprise, Luna\u2019s is dark. I step inside, and the door closes with a thud behind me. It occurs to me that I should turn around and walk right back out that door and get a cab. Hunger is not reason\u2019s best friend, after all. \n        As I begin to turn around to leave, I hear \u201cSurprise!\u201d \n        The lights go on and all my friends are here. Confetti is flying everywhere! Balloons are up, and there is a banner that says: Happy Birthday, Diana! \n        I am stunned. As I am trying to take in everything, a bright light shines on the stage near the back of the bar, and there is a band on it. The singer yells, \u201cLet\u2019s give a big shout-out to Diana! Happy Birthday, girl! Let\u2019s get this party started!\u201d They start singing \u201cUptown Funk!\u201d I love that song!\n        Suddenly, I\u2019m surrounded by all of my friends, who are hugging me. I can\u2019t believe it, I forgot it was my birthday today. I mean, I never celebrate it anyway. They pull me to the dance floor, and we all start to dance. A while later, the zombie guy, who turns out to be one of the cooks that my friend knows, goes up to the microphone and announces: \u201cdinner is served.\u201d There is so much food. My friends know me so well, because one of the dishes is spinach and artichoke dip, yum!\n        What a brilliant night! Great music, lots of food, and dancing with my friends. It will be a night I will always remember. I\u2019m glad that I opened up the cursed envelope. \n        Oh, what a night! I sink into my bed with my dog beside me. It\u2019s impossible for me not to smile as I reflect upon everything that just happened. I\u2019m so happy. My friends are the best. Happy birthday to me! \n\n"}

Santa, Inc. informs the protagonist that, due to a shortage of Impossibilium in Scaryland, their outdated Good-O-Meter could not be serviced.

We had gotten our tree up and decorated on Thanksday weekend, as always. Lulabell and I had gotten all the sparkling, frosting-adorned, magical winter cupcakes to the correct classrooms on the correct days. Stockings were hung and all that. We had done all of the official duties assigned to us for the holidays, and it was time to celebrate.\n        As I got down the stairs and entered the living room, I was stunned when I was not greeted by an array of presents in artful piles, covered in ribbons, bows, and shiny paper. There was nothing under there, in fact. It was just as we had left it the night before.\n        \u201cDid Santa miss our house?\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cI mean, the kids have been naughty a few times that year, but nothing that would warrant a lump of coal or a bag of switches.\u201d\n        Honestly, I\u2019ve never met anybody who actually got nothing for the holiday. Other than a kid from a song that was clearly invented to indoctrinate us into being good little citizens of Fairyland. But really, no one believed that stuff was true, except for the one about how he\u2019s making a list and checking it however many times. They really do see you when you\u2019re sleeping and know when you\u2019re awake. \n        In the glow of the lights on the tree, I could see that the cookies were gone. So, someone had been there, but who? Yes, they could just come into our house on the holiday eve. We authorized it. \n        I hit the light switch, and once my eyes adjusted to the brightness, I saw an envelope sticking out from the tree. It had the \u201cSanta, Inc.\u201d official logo in the corner where a return address would be. In the center, instead of listing our address, all it said was \u201cCurrent Resident\u201d in jaggedy dot-matrix print. \n        \u201cWhat in the jingle bells?\u201d I realized I had said that almost too loudly and had put myself in danger of waking Lula and the kids. I opened the envelope to find a notice on official Santa Company letterhead. It read as follows:\n        Dear Citizen of Fairyland,\n        We have been trying to reach out to you about your Good-O-Meter account.\n        Through no fault of our own, we were unable to properly calibrate the somewhat antiquated Good-o-Meter outdoor unit on your chimney this year. As you are well aware, the outbreak of Magical Flu that originated in Scaryland has sharply affected our supply of Impossibillium 33, which powers the Good-o-Meter model 3LV3S associated with your account. As such, your level of Goodness could not be assessed this year. \n        If you had opted to purchase the newer 3LV3S 2000 model, as we have heavily advertised to you for months, you could have avoided this unfortunate situation.\n        We apologize for any inconvenience or disappointment this might have caused and wish you a joyous Holiday.\n        Sincerely,\n        Santa C. Nicholas, CEO\n        \u201cFairydust!\u201d I said. It was the worst swear we have. I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I said it out loud. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t buy your panopticon, authoritarian gadget?\u201d \n        How was I going to tell the kids? Since the last election, nobody really knows where Santa, Inc., ends and Fairyland begins. You would think that in a world of magical beings, everyone would keep it magical, but you know what? The creep of bureaucracy has no limits.\n        We decided to emigrate after that. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 not to Scaryland. Although from the coverage on GBC news, it sounds like it\u2019s not as scary there as we were told. Nope. We moved to Garyland. Sure, we will all be named Gary, but everyone is nice and reliable there. No big surprises with a Gary.\n\n"}
