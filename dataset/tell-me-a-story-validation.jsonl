Permission to dock, please.\u201d Elin, the pilot and lone passenger, waited for a response. Thirty seconds, then sixty. Still nothing.\n        \u201cRepeat: This is Shuttle Three to Sentinel. Permission to dock as requested.\u201d After the seconds stretched into silence again, the communicator finally crackled, buzzed, but then it fell lifeless.\n        \u201cOnce again, Lieutenant Elin requesting permission to dock Shuttle Three.\u201d The pilot waited again, beginning to shift nervously in the slightly worn, padded flight chair. The comm panel display showed no signal coming in from the Sentinel.\n        Elin pulled the shuttle closer to the ship\u2019s main docking bay, hoping to get a visual on what caused the delay. The Lieutenant swung the small, two-person craft around to a three-meter port on the ship\u2019s underside. The dock hung open, the two sets of interlocking doors parted to reveal an abandoned bay. No suited-up workers waited inside to receive the scheduled arrival. \n        \u201cOdd,\u201d said Elin, into the silence of the tiny craft.\n        The pilot brought the shuttle into view of the two secondary docking ports. One appeared normal, the doors sealed. The other stood open to the void of space like the main bay, no crew members inside to receive shipments or arrivals.\n        The irregularities convinced Elin to switch comm channels. \u201cElin to Command. Elin to Command. Seeking permission to dock in Secondary Bay 1. Please advise.\u201d\n        Finally, the comm lit up, and a voice came through. Captain Yancey\u2019s voice, which had sounded cool and professional in Elin\u2019s ship assignment packet, now blared through the speaker in obvious alarm.                                 \u201cLieutenant! Do not dock! I repeat. Do not dock! We have a quarantine situation on the ship. Do not dock, and do not board! It\u2019s in our life support systems. It\u2019s everywhere! The Command Bridge is sealed off on auxiliary life support, but we don\u2019t know how long we can last like this.\u201d The comm fell silent again.\n        Elin, newly commissioned communications officer and pilot trainee, approved for her first assignment just last week, and now stuck outside a quarantined star cruiser. Because of course.\n        The Lieutenant thumbed the coordinates to contact StarBase. \u201cHello, Base? This is Elin, sent on assignment to the SS Sentinel. The ship is in a quarantine situation. Request to return to base until situation is resolved.\u201d\n        The comm panel lit up again, and a loud pop issued over the speakers. \u201cNegative! Negative! Do not return to base. We have an outbreak of unknown origin. We\u2019re in quarantine too, since 0800.\u201d It was Jemison. The Lieutenant detected an uncharacteristic undertone of panic in his voice.\n        Elin felt the same panic rise in her gut. She took a breath and tamped it down, straining to remain professional. \u201cIf I stay at the Sentinel any longer, I won\u2019t have enough fuel and O2 to return to base. Please advise.\u201d\n        \u201cSee if the Sentinel has any fuel cells they can put out into one of their docks for you. This thing keeps spreading exponentially. I think you\u2019re going to have to return to Homeworld. Can the shuttle make the jump?\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s not approved for multisystem travel.\u201d Elin\u2019s teeth clenched.\n        \u201cLieutenant, consider it approved.\u201d\n        Jemison was not the type to make a hasty decision. \u201cAre you sure, Commander?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, Elin. I\u2019ll send you what data we have on the outbreak and an approval to land.\u201d\n        \u201cCommander, I\u2019ve tried several times to contact the Sentinel. Yancey indicated that it has spread throughout the ship. I don\u2019t know if anyone will be there to receive me or to put out fuel cells and O2 cans.\u201d\n        The comm panel blinked on, then off again. Elin heard some chatter in the background during the brief burst. Jemison\u2019s voice filled the space again after a brief silence. \u201cElin, we\u2019re no longer able to raise any signal from the Sentinel, Do you have a bio-haz suit on board?\u201d\n        \u201cYes, Commander. I have one in Emergency Supply.\u201d Elin breathed in, anticipating what the officer had in mind.\n        \u201cI need you to force-dock with the Sentinel and go through the airlock using the standard manual sequence. Record everything you find there and send the video to me and to Homeworld Command. This is bad, Lieutenant. Very bad. We have to find out what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d \nElin swallowed hard. \u201cDo you have any sense of what I\u2019ll find?\u201d\n        \u201cOur people are in full haz-suits in the lab trying to work that out. It\u2019s not anything we\u2019ve seen before. Turns biological organisms into a puddle of bloody goo. Good luck on your first assignment, Lieutenant.\u201d Jemison laughed grimly. \u201cBe glad you launched yesterday before it took hold here.\u201d\n"}

At the end of the story, the main character should be alone and unable to escape. While they are trapped, they think about their grandfather, who was a truck driver. The story should have a melancholic tone. ","targets":"\n        After more than a decade of running transport missions in this comfortable, old shuttle, my body felt more at ease in my captain\u2019s seat than it did laying next to Kate in my own bed at home. \n        As always, right at the moment of launch, I touched the medallion my Pap got from the Teamsters. I kept it next to the control panel. It was my talisman. Over the years, it had taken on a spiritual quality. Pap had been one of the very last Teamsters to drive an over-the-road truck in those final years before the self-driving freights took the last of the jobs. The open road had been his church, his sacred space. I\u2019d joined the union the year before he passed away. \n        Of course, like the thousands of others in my apprenticeship, we were trained to move {2} goods on shuttles between port cities on Earth and the new colonies on Mars. It gave Pap a sense of awe that the same union that had negotiated protections and wages for the generations of laborers now represented his strange, quiet granddaughter as she shuttled essentials between Earth and our neighboring planet. \n        This launch had been as uneventful as the hundreds I\u2019d managed before. Now, I let my mind relax as I took in the familiar view of the pretty green and blue globe dimming behind me. The vast beauty of space flabbergasted me that first time, all those years ago. By now, it too had become comforting. As the warm hum of the spacecraft's engines vibrated around me, I programmed the coordinates into my console. This well-worn route was what the open road had been to my Pap: a respite. He\u2019d cherished the quiet of the road; I cherished the quiet of the stars.\n        I thought back to the century-old country songs he'd play in his ancient truck. So many of them wax poetic about the love between a man and his rig. I felt that same lyrical affection for my spacecraft. I knew her so well that I loved every part of her, from her sleek metal exterior to the messy captain\u2019s quarters that would be my home for the next fifteen days. \n        It has been almost two months since my last transport. Kate, like so many of the wives in my Pap\u2019s songs, had been putting her foot down more often recently, demanding that I take more time between jobs to stay with her in our crowded little compound in Chicago. Coming home to her was always a joy. But, like the generations of road warriors that I came from, I knew that the only thing I loved more than coming home was leaving home. \n        I loved Kate in a way that surprised me. The fact that a loner like me could love another human so much felt somewhat astonishing at first. But waking up in her arms day after day, bumping into her in every corner of our tiny city quarters, being confined to such a small space for hours, sensing her emotional vibrations, all of it had a way of making me feel itchy. Like my Pap, I needed time alone, a chance to embrace the solitude that had always been at my core.\n        In the early days, when I first sat behind the console of my ship, I felt like an adventurer. But the transport routes between Earth and Mars had become the interstate highways of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries \u2013 well-traveled and predictable. I knew that I wasn\u2019t a pioneer. I was a Teamster, carrying on a tradition of transport that had evolved from the open road to the open skies.\n        As I was settling into the silence and comfort of my routine, an alert message appeared on my console. It read: \u201cStorage Docking Approval Request\u201d. The alerts were usually only used when I was near my final destination in the Martian Colony and preparing to unload. Why would this message appear now? Who could be asking for permission to dock with my storage container. I checked my radar. I was in deep space, more than a day\u2019s journey away from any small carrier ship needing to connect to my storage container. \n        I rejected the message and checked my radar. Could another transport ship be in trouble? I reached out to the network, noting the nearest fellow Teamster ship on my radar. It was thousands of miles ahead of me. No one else could be in range.\n        Again, the alert message appeared on my screen. Again, I denied the request. \n        The very last time the Pap ever drove, he was taking a haul on the back roads of North Dakota. He was driving an oil tanker on an overnight haul, and it was the blackest of night. Suddenly, ahead of him on an empty road, he saw a small sedan, a real beater, lying at a horrifying angle, tipped over, directly across the highway. He slammed his brakes and ran to see if the driver was injured, leaving his engine running. But when he got to the driver\u2019s door, he saw that the car was empty. \n        Too late, he looked back. Two people, almost invisible in the dark night, were climbing into his truck, reaching for the gear shift. Before he could even yell out, they were gone. His beloved truck and thousands of dollars of oil were taken by thieves. Alone on the road, he watched as the truck that had been his career, his home, and his identity, disappeared down the empty, cold highway.\n        Again, the console flashed. \u201cStorage Docking Approval Request.\u201d No. No. Not here. This could only mean one thing. My body froze in horror. Cold sweat dripped down my neck.\n        On my radar, a tiny irregularity appeared. Another ship appeared on the screen. Only Teamsters were approved to run this route, and this was no Teamster. Nor was this a government ship. It could only be one thing, the thing that all transporters had learned to fear more than any other: a pirate craft.\n        I quickly disabled the auto-drive and took over manual control. I knew this ship better than I knew my own mind. Grabbing the gears that I usually only used for docking, I dramatically swerved off of my pre-programmed path. The small dot on the radar followed, moving closer and closer on my screen. The pirate was gaining on me. If it managed to dock with my ship, there would be little I could do to protect the supply I was transporting.\n        I began pounding \u201cMayday\u201d into my console, trying to alert any other nearby ships about the danger. \n        Then, I heard it. The horrible crash of metal against metal as the warm engine hum shut off. My beautiful ship shuddered and then stalled. \n        There was nothing else to be done. All I could do was follow protocol. I programmed into my console, \u201cDisconnect\u201d and felt my ship shudder as the storage container fell away from my captain\u2019s quarters. \n        Now, all I had to do was shut my whole system down, restart it, and I should be able to return to the Earth port, sacrificing my haul, but saving my life. I hit the manual override and turned my ship completely off. All the power shut down. I was in complete silence. I held my breath as I hit the manual restart of the engines. Again, I heard the grating, ugly sound of metal grating against metal. When the pirates\u2019 craft crashed against my storage container, it damaged the engine. My shuttle wouldn\u2019t restart.\n        It was all over in a moment. Out of my window, I saw the pirate craft connect to my free floating storage container and gracefully turn away, back in the direction of the dim blue dot of earth. My disconnected captain\u2019s quarters were now just a floating box in the vast empty nothingness of space. \n        I imagined Kate in our cramped compound, with her needs and her love, anxious for my return. I imagined her safe world full of feeling, chaos, and crowded space. I took Pap\u2019s Teamster medallion off of the now useless console and held it in my hands. I looked out at the empty darkness. Soundless, motionless stillness was all around me. Solitude. Perfect and permanent solitude. \n\n\n"}

I\u2019m writing to you from my sleeping pod that I share with Artemis, a dog, trained to literally sniff out new life.\n        Artemis steals my pillow and begs for food. Apparently, her training was mission focused and lacked some basic etiquette. That\u2019s fine. It is not like I need the one small, hard, pillow in my pod. On the bright side, it is rather cold on the ship, and she helps keep me warm. I should keep this entry short, since she already ate a few pages from my journal. Plus, I have to be up an hour earlier than normal to take Artemis to her \u201cpark\u201d before we go to the mess hall for breakfast.\n[Mission Date 05.30.3025] \n        I\u2019m on a spaceship, and I write in a paper journal. It might seem odd to you, my dearest Diary, that I prefer a pen and paper over a computer file. However, writing in a journal makes me feel connected to Earth, to home, and to my books that I left behind. It was worth using up some of my assigned luggage space for a few comfort journals. \n        Once in a while, it is a relief to look at something other than a monitor, although the harsh white lights are inescapable. I miss sunlight and fresh air. I would give anything to hear the sound of rain hitting the window. I feel like I am merging with the ship and the routine of it all. Writing to you, on paper, makes me feel like I am holding onto my humanity. It helps me remember my voice, my individuality. It gives me focus as we move through the darkness of space. \n        Duty calls! Until next time, my friend. \n[Mission Date 06.02.3025] \n        Oh. My. God. Diary, Artemis gets up so early in the morning. When I wake up, I see her big blue eyes narrowed, staring at me, her floppy ears in the annoyed position, and the silver of her fur turning dark in the pale light of the room. There is no need for an alarm when I have Artemis\u2019s insistent paw hitting my shoulder to wake me. \n        This is my life now: I start my day with a hit from a paw, followed by a shower, if you can call it that. Artemis and I go to her \u201cpark,\u201d a large square of rough grass amongst the other foliage growing to support the mission, then her training sessions, followed by breakfast. Fun now is watching Artemis beg for food during my meals. The afternoon is a repeat of the morning, except I interview ship leaders to chronicle our journey. At first, it was fun learning about all aspects of the mission, and it is part of my job as the mission\u2019s chronicler to record our daily life in the official log. I find there is less and less to record in the log, or even tell you. \n[Mission Date 08.22.3025] \n        It was different at the start of this endeavor, Diary. The first few weeks of the mission were so exciting. A few days before we were to leave, Artemis\u2019s handler got sick with the flu, and I was quickly trained to be her new handler in addition to my chronicling duties. There was a rush to train Artemis and I to work together, then liftoff, and a meeting with the space station.\n        The days at the space station were filled with a flurry of activities: interviews, last minute training sessions, group pictures, and our farewell communications to Earth. The view was spectacular, our planet against the backdrop of space; it was everything I dreamed about during training. The view, the mission, everything was amazing, new, and we were heroes about to go forth into the unknown on an important mission. We were a team with a common goal, ready to face any challenge. We were united in leaving our little home planet behind, secure in our sense of humanity, and our belief in the mission. \n[Mission Date 08.27.3025]\n        Heroism's glow wanes as existential terror sets in. I am in a metal object floating through the abyss of space. I stare out at the void from one of the windows by Artemis\u2019s \u201cpark.\u201d Diary, there are stars, but they do not look the same as they do from Earth. There are no recognizable constellations, if you are not trained to find them, just little glimmers against the blackness. Which is why I am glad to have you. Writing to you breaks the silence of space and the agony of routine. Words are now my constant in the way the stars used to be, but are no longer. \n[Mission Date 11.28.3025] \n        Diary, the days fade together. I would say the days are long, but even time is different on a spaceship. Time is marked by our daily activities, not the rising or setting of the sun. Except for turning the light off in your sleeping pod, nothing changes on the ship to mark the difference between day and night. One moment falls into the next. I never thought that routine would be the biggest challenge to overcome. Routine and waiting. Waiting is what we do on this ship. Everyone is in a holding pattern until our real work begins on Mars.        \n        It is hard to keep up morale, and remember that there is a larger goal we are working toward. Waiting for future possibilities is a struggle for everyone, except for Artemis. She loves her routine, and stealing my pillow. Little did I know when I trained for spaceflight, that the most riveting part of my day would be watching Artemis sniff gray things to determine if there is \u201cbiological life on it.\u201d For these training sessions, \u201cbiological life\u201d is just a grass seed. \n        I'm getting excited about a grass seed.\n[Mission Date 12.14.3025] \n        I\u2019m exhausted. Something happened, and we had an emergency alert. An alarm woke me up before Artemis did. Everything is supposedly alright. Our lighting is down to emergency levels, and we are all supposed to gather in the mess hall. Artemis will be upset to miss her \u201cpark\u201d time.\n        I have to go, until later, dear friend. \n[Earth, 12.28.3025] \n        I can\u2019t believe she is gone. My Artemis, my friend. If it had not been for the flu, I would have been there with her. Me, the person who raised her from a puppy, and who trained her for the mission. She trusted me and I loved her. Hot tears fell heavily on the cold yellow paper delivered by the uniformed men. The words before me blurred in a watery haze: all communication with the spaceship was lost. An emergency pod returned to Earth with classified mission information, including this journal written by the ship\u2019s chronicler."}

But our ship, the United Nations Exploratory Ship Outbound Wanderer, experienced some kind of damage to the Faster-Than-Light drive systems. Best guess? Some kind of dark matter particle that was solid enough in FTL-space at just the right time. Well, wrong time.\n        After she looked over the engines, Engineer Song explained that our FTL drive couldn\u2019t be shut down anymore. \u201cLuckily,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re only going 10 times the speed of light. Any faster, and I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to the ship.\u201d\n        And of course, whatever caused the accident in the first place damaged two of the five life pods in the process. Ten crew, three pods, with a max of three people per pod, and the math was pretty clear: someone had to stay behind.\n        Captain Evans volunteered, said something about the captain going down with her ship and all that. I probably shouldn\u2019t have laughed in her face, but it\u2019s 2214, and we\u2019re not military. \u201cLook,\u201d I continued, \u201cI\u2019m the best suited of all of us to stay back. This is my first time out so I don\u2019t have the experience the rest of you do, but I\u2019m also more familiar with the ship\u2019s systems than any of you, since I helped put it together.\u201d\n        The rest of the crew grumbled and tried to convince me to go, but eventually Captain Evans gave in, and that was that.\n        Lifepods aren\u2019t shielded against FTL-space, so by now they\u2019re all in normal-space. Broadcasting distress signals for what that\u2019s worth, though Fred did try to drop them near inhabited systems. At this point, I can hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.\n        I pushed away from the keyboard, exhaling slowly.\n        \u201cCommunication Specialist Mills, are you finished with your log?\u201d Fred had picked a voice that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place singing torch songs a couple of centuries ago; MI\u2019s knew about gender and frankly didn\u2019t see the point.\n        \u201cAs much as I can be, I suppose,\u201d I answered, stretching a bit. A faint whine from the engine spaces reverberated through the hull of the Outbound Wanderer, the only obvious signal the ship wasn\u2019t operating the way it should. I glanced around the bridge: round and sleek and lit as though Earth\u2019s sun was somehow overhead, just out of view.\n        \u201cI have some news you may find distressing.\u201d\n        \u201cMore than being stuck in a ship at FTL with no way to drop back into normal-space?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry, yes. I\u2019ve done some more calculations, and the ship has now deviated from its pre-programmed course.\u201d\n        Of course it has, I thought. \u201cIs the ship still traveling in a straight line? I mean, as much as that\u2019s possible in FTL-space?\u201d\n        \u201cAn astute question. The ship is now traveling in what is effectively a curve.\u201d Fred paused. \u201cI\u2019ve calculated our new path, but there is no way to communicate this information to normal-space.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not good.\u201d I headed back to stowage. \u201cSupplies?\u201d \n        \u201cSufficient food and fluids for you for approximately four months. The remaining systems were either not affected or Engineer Song was able to effect repairs.\u201d\n        \u201cHelp build a ship,\u201d I muttered. \u201cGo exploring in a vessel you helped fabricate. See the local galactic regions, and communicate with new sentients.\u201d Stowage was just that: a room full of closets, drawers, cabinets, and bins full of things the crew wouldn\u2019t regularly need.\n        \u201cThat sounds like the recruitment offers made to the orbital habitats,\u201d Fred offered.\n        \u201cIt was. When you\u2019re the fourth child, you don\u2019t expect to have any opportunities outside of the family business. It sounded like an easy way to escape a destiny of farming and animal husbandry.\u201d I paused. \u201cWait, you said all the remaining systems are online, right?\u201d\n        \u201cThe only systems that could not be repaired are those connected to the FTL drive.\u201d Fred paused, probably an eternity for it. \u201cYou have an idea.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, I think so. Do we have enough material for printing beacons?\u201d By that point, I was sorting through everything that wasn\u2019t food that I couldn\u2019t use for my own needs.\n        \u201cThe fabricator was used for replacement parts for other damaged systems. Please allow me a moment to \u2013 yes, storage appears to have sufficient resources to print four beacons.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd nothing we can repurpose? I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to need twenty-seven pairs of pants not in my size.\u201d\n        Fred, as with most MIs, had no sense of humor. \u201cMost of the duplicate resources are recyclable, but the specific parts that form the core of the beacon cannot be printed from what is currently available.\u201d\n        I grunted acknowledgement. \u201cRight. How much information can we program into the beacons? By we, I mean you Fred.\u201d\n        \u201cThe beacons can only broadcast their location. They lack the capability that would allow me to provide added information.\u201d\n        \u201cOf course,\u201d I sighed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to guess there\u2019s no way to change that?\u201d\n        \u201cNot without more materials than are available on this ship.\u201d\n        It took me a couple of hours more, but I\u2019d recycled the incidentals that weren\u2019t going to get used. Back in my quarters, my unmade bunk looked like paradise. I\u2019d been dead asleep during the accident, and could feel the fatigue creeping back in. \u201cI think three beacons should be enough to point any rescuers in the right direction. I need at least some sleep, Fred. Can you drop a beacon every, hm, twelve standard hours? I think that should be enough for anyone to find us? Maybe save the fourth for an emergency?\u201d\n        \u201cI agree, Communication Specialist Mills. Both for your need for sleep, and your proposed plan. Deploying beacon in five standard minutes, allowing for printing and fabrication time.\u201d\n        My bunk had never felt so welcoming.\n        Four hours later, I\u2019d gotten enough sleep and had decided to spend at least some time on maintenance. Even in a fabricated ship, things still needed tightening, loosening, and\/or lubrication. \n        \u201cMy reference database refers to what you are doing as \u2018busy work\u2019, Communication Specialist MIlls.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, considering there are two more beacons to drop, and even after that there\u2019s no way to know if there\u2019ll be a rescue, I\u2019d like the ship to at least hold together for however long. And I\u2019m not going to go through the rest of the crew\u2019s things. They\u2019re not here to consent, and I don\u2019t need to know what they decided to bring with them.\u201d\n        \u201cYou are being very considerate.\u201d\n        \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anyone poking around in my stuff if I weren\u2019t here. Not like I had any privacy back home. So I\u2019m kind of a stickler for it now.\u201d\n        Fred suggested, \u201cI have an extensive library of entertainment, ranging from literature from the dawn of writing to complex virtual simulations of locations that humanity considers ideal for relaxation.\u201d\n        \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re doing, Fred. And yeah, I\u2019ll probably partake at some point. It\u2019s not like I was going to be doing anything really different if there hadn\u2019t been an accident.\u201d\n        Hours led into days, cycles of sleep, maintenance, and entertainment. The ship didn\u2019t need much in the way of maintenance, but I didn\u2019t want to risk anything else coming apart at the seams. Fred said the odds of the accident happening were \u201cexceedingly improbable,\u201d but a one in a trillion chance still means there\u2019s a \u201cone\u201d in there. And even if the chances of a repeat accident were even less likely, I wanted to be prepared. \n        The entertainment I focused on were the novels. Reading, even at adapted speeds, was still enjoyable. I\u2019d be distracted for a few hours, lost in a world of someone else\u2019s creation, and thankfully Fred had enough storage that I wasn\u2019t in any danger of running out of reading materials.\n        \u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t enjoy a simulation of a white sand beach?\u201d Fred asked at one point.\n        \u201cCan I read while I\u2019m on the beach? You know, a simulated book in the simulation of the beach?\u201d\n        \u201cI have sufficient processing power for this, but most of the rest of the crew had requested time playing in the ocean.\u201d\n        \u201cWell, they probably all grew up planet-side. Water behaves differently in the orbitals, but I at least like the sound of the waves.\u201d\n        On the sixth day after the accident, while puttering around the bridge, I broached a topic of concern. \u201cThe drive was supposed to shut down automatically, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n        \u201cAccording to the mission parameters,\u201d Fred replied, \u201cthe ship was supposed to stay in FTL-space for two weeks from the start of the mission. As the accident occurred approximately one week into the mission, the shut down instructions are still due to be sent to the drive systems tomorrow.\u201d\n        \u201cBut the physical components of the drive can\u2019t respond to that instruction, right?\u201d\n        \u201cTheoretically, no. The designers did not plan for this possibility.\u201d\n        \u201cSo,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cwe\u2019re just going to keep flying until someone somehow manages to locate us, and somehow match our speed, and somehow connect with our ship.\u201d\n        \u201cAre you only now realizing this, or simply verbalizing because we are near the intended time for re-entry to normal-space?\u201d\n        \u201cVerbalizing to the only other sentient available. I\u2019ve been trying to think of something, anything that might help, but it only occurred to me after you\u2019d dropped the second beacon that we could have tried decelerating.\u201d\n        \u201cI attempted deceleration after the lifepods were launched, but the damage locked me out of the controls for the drive, and even Engineer Song would have had difficulty fixing the system enough to allow a manual adjustment.\u201d\n        Frowning, I continued, \u201cAnd my non-technical understanding of FTL-space is that there\u2019s nothing really here to stop us, random dark matter particles aside.\u201d\n        \u201cCorrect,\u201d Fred responded.\n        I was about to respond when Fred announced, \u201cMy sensors have detected an object of significant size moving into proximity with us. There is a strong likelihood this is a ship, but due to the nature of FTL-space, I cannot determine more than that.\u201d\n        I had no idea where we were, how it corresponded with normal-space, nor whether there was anyone \u201cout there.\u201d Before I could respond, the hull of the ship reverberated with a series of clunks and thuds.\n        \u201cThey have made contact. The likelihood this is a ship is now almost a certainty, but I cannot determine \u2013\u201d\n        My gut clenched as the room spun, colors briefly flashing to their inverse. We\u2019d dropped out of FTL-space. The faster-than-light engines powered down, the ship's systems switching back automatically for functioning in normal-space.\n        It was obvious, but I couldn\u2019t control myself. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d\n\n"}

He touched his face with a bony gray finger and examined the iridescent green blood on his fingertip. Memories of the panicked cries of his crewmates as they plummeted to the earth flashed through his mind. \n        Xanti slid from what was left of his seat and crawled over the unrecognizable remains of the instrument panel to search for his friends, Valtrox and Hydron. A foot peeked out from the debris, and Xanti crawled faster, towards it. He burrowed through destroyed equipment and hurled metal with reckless abandon. \n        Valtrox and Hydron lay still at their stations, mouths agape and terror frozen in their eyes. Xanti cried out and shook their lifeless bodies but to no avail. Forty-nine missions together, but there would not be a fiftieth. \n        The orange lights of the spacecraft flickered and sparked, illuminating the interior of the ship. Xanti slumped back against the wall and covered his face with his hands. A curious bull approached the window to investigate the loud commotion. His horn tapped the glass, snapping Xanti out of his moment of self pity.\n        He placed his long fingers on the windowsill and pulled himself up to peer out the window. A brown eye against the glass greeted him. Xanti jumped back, startled. Fifty cows had gathered around the craft. Some grew bored and began to graze on the sparse patches of grass, but many continued to watch intensely, occasionally moaning out in their disapproval. \n        The bull backed up. Xanti approached the window once more and gently touched the crack in the glass. \n        Through the haze of smoke and dust, a cluster of lights appeared in the distance. As they drew closer, he could make out a cavalcade of trucks speeding through the pasture, kicking up dirt and taking out every cactus and mesquite bush in their path. \n        Xanti\u2019s mouth fell open. His hand trembled against the broken window pane. He knew he had to flee the once safe confines of the ship. He would be too easy to catch if he remained where he was. \n        Unfortunately, the ship had crashed door-first into the earth, rendering it useless. Xanti\u2019s only hope to break out was through the emergency escape pod. If only they had been able to reach it before the fateful crash. He scurried to the hatch, but it would not budge. A fallen beam rested atop a pile of twisted metal. Xanti lifted the heavy beam as though it weighed nothing and rammed it into the pod door. \n        In the distance, he could hear tires screech and engines roar. They were almost upon him. As the procession neared, the hatch finally flew open. \n        Xanti lowered himself from the ship and lay flat on the ground. He slid on his belly like a snake, blending in with the rocky terrain. Trucks closed in on the crash site, scattering the anxious cow onlookers.  A hoof came down full force on Xanti\u2019s hand, and he held his breath to contain a scream. Away from the lights of the ship, he struggled to pull himself to his feet. He hobbled along in the cloak of the stampede and dove through the threshold of the weathered shack. \n        In a frantic search for cover, Xanti grabbed a tattered patchwork quilt and crawled under the rickety bed in the corner. He gasped to catch his breath, which was even more challenging in this heavy atmosphere. Through the gaps in the shacks' rotting walls, Xanti watched the humans gather in awe as his crewmates were wheeled from the craft by men in protective suits. \n        Anguish engulfed Xanti as he considered his new reality, abandoned, five-million lightyears from home. He curled up on his side and pulled the quilt tighter around him. Perhaps Valtrox and Hydron were the lucky ones.\n"}

It\u2019s practically begging to be explored.\u201d \n        \u201cMy dad would kill us!\u201d Krissy whispered back. \n        \u201cHe\u2019ll never find out! Come on, I just want to look around! My parents still own an AstraVoyager. I\u2019ve never even seen a Warpstar until today!\u201d He pleaded with                 Krissy, giving her his best puppy-dog eyes. \n        Jack and Krissy\u2019s parents were some of the only residents of the planet Keplar-168 who had spaceship permits, since their dads both ran transport for supplies to nearby planets. Jack\u2019s parents refused to teach him anything about their ship, but Krissy\u2019s dad encouraged her curiosity and had been giving her lessons on flying since she was old enough to toddle up the ramp on her own. \n        Krissy looked at the Warpstar 3001, then back at her parents. Her mom and dad were seated at a table on the other side of the cafeteria, engaged in conversation with Jack\u2019s mom and grandpa. She knew she could get in big trouble for going on the spaceship without an adult, but she couldn\u2019t get in trouble if she didn\u2019t get caught, right? She looked back at Jack, who was still giving her his most convincing pleading eyes.         \n        \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she finally relented. \n        Jack threw his fist in the air and whooped loudly. \n        Krissy smacked his arm. \u201cDo you want to get caught already!?\u201d she hissed. Jack apologized, looking over his shoulder to make sure their parents hadn\u2019t heard him. \n        When they were sure that no one was watching, the two of them snuck out of the cafeteria doors toward the ship landing field.\n        Krissy looked over at Jack and laughed at his expression of pure awe. She and Jack had grown up together, here on Keplar-168. Their moms worked together as engineers on the space station, and Krissy couldn\u2019t remember a time when she and Jack weren\u2019t partners-in-crime. They had both been born here, the first babies to officially be residents of Keplar-168 and not Earth. The past eleven years had been difficult for their parents and the other adults who had to adjust to a new atmosphere and way of life. But, Keplar-168 was all that Krissy and Jack had ever known.\n        They reached the landing field and looked around to make sure no one had noticed them sneaking off. When they were certain they were alone and unsupervised, they quietly stepped onto the boarding ramp and into the belly of the ship. \n        \u201cWhoa,\u201d Jack breathed, looking around him. He reached out and touched the blinking lights on the panel next to him.\n        \u201cHey, cut it out!\u201d Krissy yelped, smacking his hand away. \u201cYou said you wanted to look!\u201d \n        \u201cWhy would your dad leave this thing on?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he worried someone is going to steal it?\u201d \n        Krissy laughed. \u201cAnd take it where? Keplar-147? Maybe Keplar-125? Oh scary, they might go stock up on supplies!\u201d Jack rolled his eyes and continued walking around and admiring the gadgets. \n        \u201cHey, what does this do?\u201d Jack asked, pressing a bright green button. \n        Before Krissy could react, the hatch slid closed and the engines clicked into gear. \n        \u201cOh my god, Jack, what have you done?!\u201d Krissy shouted, running over and pressing the button repeatedly. Jack stared back at her, blank-faced. \n        \u201cUh-I- Um, I just pressed a button. It wasn\u2019t labeled or anything! How was I supposed to know it was the button?\u201d He stammered, holding his hands up and backing away from Krissy. The look in her eye meant business, and Jack knew how brutal Krissy could be when she was mad. \n        \u201cWhy,\u201d she began through gritted teeth, \u201cwould you press any button? You don\u2019t even know how to fly a ship!\u201d The ship whirred up into the night sky and a robotic voice boomed from overhead. \n        \u201cDefault destination: Kepler-125. Please confirm,\u201d the voice instructed. The ship oriented west and began to move forward. \n        \u201cNo!\u201d Krissy yelled. She turned away from Jack and surveyed the panel in front of her. She searched each button and lever until she found the one she wanted. \n        Krissy pressed the satellite intercom button. \u201cRadio home tower,\u201d she instructed the ship. \n        \u201cRadioing home tower,\u201d the ship responded dutifully, as it continued toward Keplar-125. \n        \u201cHello?\u201d Krissy heard her mom\u2019s voice through the intercom.         \n        \u201cMom!\u201d Krissy shouted in distress. \u201cMom, you have to help! Jack and I are stuck on the spaceship, and it\u2019s moving off-planet!\u201d\n        \u201cKrissy, is that you? Where are you?\u201d She heard her dad\u2019s voice come through. Krissy gulped and gave Jack a withering glare. \n        \u201cDad, I\u2019m so sorry. I let Jack talk me into coming onto the Warpstar, and he pressed the activate button. Now we\u2019re on the ship, and it\u2019s trying to fly somewhere!\u201d \n        Krissy heard her dad sigh, and she shot Jack another look. She was going to be paying for this mistake until she died, she was certain of it. \n        \u201cKrissy, you know how to do this. Just relax and remember what I\u2019ve taught you,\u201d her dad said encouragingly. \n        Krissy took a deep breath and nodded, though her dad couldn\u2019t see her. She took a seat in the captain\u2019s chair and scanned the panel in front of her for the control wheel that would change the ship\u2019s direction. \n        \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Jack asked timidly from behind her. \n        Krissy swatted him away. \u201cGo sit on that bench and don\u2019t touch anything,\u201d she instructed. Jack gulped and nodded silently, taking a seat and clasping his hands in his lap. \n        Krissy took a hold of the control wheel and aimed it back toward their home planet. She pressed the accelerator lever forward, gently increasing their speed. Luckily, they weren't very far from home, so the trip didn\u2019t take long. \n        As they approached Keplar-168, Krissy had a sudden thought. \n        \u201cDad!\u201d she shouted, panicked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t taught me how to land!\u201d \n        \u201cTake a deep breath, Kris,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like taking off, only in reverse. Follow my instructions and you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d \n        Krissy did as her dad instructed her. She took a deep breath and eased the accelerator lever down. They were now idling above the landing field on Keplar-168, outside of the cafeteria they had been eating in less than an hour before. Krissy could see all four of their parents, along with Jack\u2019s grandparents, standing to the side of the lot. \n        \u201cOkay, honey, now press the bright pink button to the left of the green one. Only press it once, and don\u2019t hold it down,\u201d her dad said. \n        Krissy pressed the pink button once and then pulled her hand back. The ship slowly descended, the noise of the engines lessening as the ship lowered itself. \n        Finally, after what felt like centuries, the engines turned off and the hatch slid open. Krissy and Jack bounded down the ramp and ran for their parents. \n        \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Jack wailed, pressing his face into his mom\u2019s stomach. \n        His mom patted his head and looked at Krissy's parents. \u201cThomas, Gloria\u2013 I think it\u2019s only fair that you determine what the consequences are for the kids\u2019 actions. It is your ship, after all,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cWell, the ship is really hard to clean,\u201d Thomas said, a glimmer in his eye. \u201cI think we\u2019ll leave it to Jack and Krissy to clean.

Approximately ten minutes ago, the door to his quarters swished opened. He peered around the corner, wondering if this was a test, malfunction, or miracle. He hoped for the latter. \n        Bobby had a knack for being in the worst possible place at the absolute worst possible time. He looked up at the cameras. They were active, but he didn\u2019t hear any guards rushing towards him nor any alarms. Maybe the universe was cutting him a break. He decided hoofing it made more sense. The sooner he got to a control panel or pod, the better his chances of escape were.\n        Bobby rounded a corner, jerking back at the sight of two mechanic bots. They were sharing data. If caught by them, they\u2019d surely throw him back in his cage. \n        Bobby closed his eyes and listened hard. They seemed to be discussing some type of malfunction. \n        Bobby turned back. He needed to find another route. He closed his eyes, imagining the layout of the XT374. There were six corridors that had control panels and four that led to pods. He chose the least likely traveled. But now, all his options seemed bad. Getting to a control panel gave him more options, but many would be monitored due to the malfunction. Bobby\u2019s best hope was a pod.\n        Bobby\u2019s feet thudded through the empty corridors. He could see the entrance to the pod chambers. He laid his palm upon the door. The door creaked as it opened several inches. \n        Bobby smushed his face against the door, peeking in. It was empty. Now, he just needed to get inside. He craned his neck looking up, down, everywhere. Nothing. There wasn\u2019t anything he could pry the door with. The bots would have something. No, that was a silly idea. He couldn\u2019t take them. No human stood a chance against any robot. Could he make it back to the quarters? Was there anything even there that he could use? He had to try.\n        Bobby pumped his legs, thus far he\u2019d only come across the two bots. Not another soul. An eerie feeling hung in the air. He couldn\u2019t be the only human left. This sparked both fear and a sense of ease. His quarters were around the next corner, there had to be something there. He\u2019d find something, use it to pry the doors open, and escape would be within reach. \n        The ship tilted as Bobby\u2019s foot settled into his quarters. Bobby grabbed onto the door jam, but the tilt was too drastic. He couldn\u2019t maintain his grip. Bobby hit the ground. He expected pain to surge throughout his body. Then, alarms sounded. \n        Were they finally coming for him? \n        Bobby scrambled to his feet. He had to find anything that could be of use. The ship was losing its orientation, and that meant things were really bad. He had ten, fifteen minutes max. \n        What was going on? \n        Even if the rest of the crew had evacuated, it was irresponsible to leave someone on board with the ship in this state. Bobby scanned the room. Everything was bolted down or a part of the ship. This was hopeless. Orientation, gravity, then air \u2014 the devil's trio of fatal mechanical issues. One soon led to the next, then ship and you were kaput. He wasn\u2019t going to make it. He slammed his fist against the floor.\n        \u201cError. Error. System error.\u201d Where was that voice coming from? That wasn't a ship message. Could one of the bots be close by? Yes, the bots. He needed to reveal himself. It would relay a message to someone about his presence on the ship. Then he\u2019d be rescued.\n        Bobby bolted out the room. He scanned from right to left. Nothing. His body tensed. He was doomed. Bobby rambled around waiting for his end. Tools floated ahead of him. A gravity pocket. He opened his mouth to scream, yet static filled his being. It was too late. His feet lifted off the floor. \n        No, this wasn\u2019t a pocket, it was a gravity well, which meant\u2026\n        A gust of wind slammed Bobby against the port view window, cracking the glass. Bobby felt like his body shattered. He stared out the cracking window, into the abyss. Stars would be his last sight, not this cold ship.  \n        His vision shifted to his reflection in the glass, seeing battered and twisted metal. Forgetting his pain and hoping for some savior, Bobby swung his head to the side. His eyes scanned the area. There wasn\u2019t anything there. How hard did he hit his head? Bobby turned back. There it was again, that twisted metal staring back at him. Unemotional, just cold steel. \n        A spark of recognition ran through Bobby. No ship could function without crew, and there was no indication that anyone had even been there. The two bots were the only sign of life. Error messages, static, twisted metal. \n        He realized he was a bot, even though he felt human. His life, his memories were real. Weren\u2019t they? He awoke in quarters? No, it was a recharging station. But he felt his legs as he ran? No, he rolled along the corridors. What was going on? What was happening, was it all fake? At this point did it matter? He was a bot. Which meant death wasn\u2019t assured. Oxygen had no bearing on his existence. Gravity was the current threat. \n        Bobby analyzed the disruptions on the ship, their time, and potential causes. The two mechanic bots he\u2019d seen were outside the main bridge. Why hadn't they entered? The problem and solution was there. It had to be a sopacitor issue. Every major system went through the sopacitor. That\u2019s what they were discussing. They were waiting on him to complete repairs. Bobby had to get to the other side of the ship \u2014 Now! \n        His thrusters had enough fuel. But breaking through this gravity well was likely to burn his reserves. Bobby breathed deeply and engaged. His loose metal clanked as he pushed through the well, popping it like a bubble. He flew through the air with such precision and speed that he was filled with elation. \n        Bobby\u2019s power faded as he came to the bridge doors. The mechanic bots rushed to his aid, sharing enough fuel to get Bobby up. Together they entered the bridge, communicating in tones. They made quick work of their task. The ship stabilized. They were saved! \n        After the sense of relief faded, Bobby felt terror rise up in him as he remembered the questions of his existence. Would he ever discover what he was or what happened to him? \n\n"}

My colleagues and I rushed to make the repairs as our Captain held fast at the helm, eyeing up the asteroid field like a wave in a tempestuous midnight sea. Officer 737 did his best to repair the damages in the central body of the ship as I aided Officer 459 in securing the fuel lines in the lower decks. \n        Officer 459 knelt down in a pool of red, viscous fluid, muttering softly, \u201cThis will absolutely impact our reserves, if we can even repair the breaches to her left flank.\u201d\n        I whispered back in agreement but with an air of hope, nervous about our team\u2019s ability to make it to our final rendezvous point at Station 10 on Kepler-452b, \u201cWe will do the best we can and that must be good enough.\u201d \n        At that moment, the alarm bells sounded a high-pitched and irregularly tempoed screech, as the ship lurched, knocking us from our knees to the floor. I felt deep in my gut that this time the iron storm must have taken some of our own. I told Officer 459 to follow me to the medical wing to help where we could.\n        My fears were realized as we stumbled down the hallway to the medical wing, located just north of the left shoulder of the ship. We stepped delicately over gelatinous bits of wall mingled with torn wires. The scent of burning flesh permeated the air. We passed by Engineer 73 as he sprayed down a small fire near the stairwell with a soot-smudged extinguisher. We reached the room marked with a blue cross and a snake wrapped around a staff. I knew it instantly to be the symbol for the ship hospital, though I never had agreed with its use in such a way, as the snake seemed to carry such dangerous connotations for humankind on Earth. What we saw in that room told us all we needed to know about the health of the ship.\n        The medical droid moved quickly across the room, aided by Officer 12, the oldest officer on the ship and the only remaining member from planet Earth. On the right of us, neatly stacked in pairs on top of each other, 6 officers and 4 engineers in various positions of death and dismemberment lay still, their fluids slowly pooling around their bodies. Wires hung from their broken appendages and one officer\u2019s eye dangled loosely from its connecting fuses. Officer 12 handed me a bag of repair tools and handed my colleague Officer 459 two clear canisters filled with artificial blue blood. He did not have to speak to me. I knew from the sorrowful look in his eye that the ship was lost.\n        The Captain entered the medical bay. His arm was badly burned and his neck leaked in cobalt spurts.  As the medical droid cauterized the wound in mechanical motions, the Captain spoke clearly: \u201cI have just met with my second in command, Officer 27. He informed me that the asteroid field damaged the ship far more than anticipated. In addition to losing over half of our crew in the initial hit to the center core, we also lost the lower right wing in the latest hit. The Starship Chinnamasta is dying. Her wounds are too far gone to repair. She will not reach Kepler-452b and though our orders are to bring her to this final destination, our ultimate mission is the preservation of the records we were ordered to carry to Station 10. I am ordering each of the remaining officers and engineers, along with the medical droid, to board the escape pod. The majority of us will go into sleep mode to preserve fuel, and though quarters will be tight in the pod, I will be able to divert us out of the asteroid field before making the final adjustment in our course towards Kepler-452b.\u201d\n        There was no need for discussion or debate. I, along with the other officers and engineers, followed the Captain down into the tangled, leathery bowels of the ship, wet and slippery with leaking fuel but still holding together somehow. We stood silently in a line, boarding the escape pod one by one. Some of us carried our comrades in our arms as many were now missing limbs or had simply shut down.. Others carried the repair tools and fluids needed to maintain our bodies for the remainder of the trip. The Captain clutched a burlap bag with papers and leather-bound books tightly to his chest, protecting the heart and soul of our journey to Kepler-452b and the reason for our very existence. We buckled ourselves into our glass encasements and I stared somberly out of a nearby porthole as we launched from the top of the ship and into the black void. \n        Starship Chinnamasta, named after an ancient Hindu deity, had given both the android race that had built her and the human race whose form she honored a new chance at life. She had sacrificed her body, much like the maternal Goddess whose stories still lurked in the pages of one of the Captain\u2019s primordial books, for the sake of her children. As our pod burst forth from the mouth of the ship\u2019s head, we could see just how extensive the damage truly was; Chinnamasta\u2019s left leg that once contained the living quarters of all of the AI officers was pockmarked, as if struck in a burst of machine-gun fire, only in this case the bullets had been metal rocks broken apart when the main asteroid chunk hit her left flank.\n        Her fingers still twitched as her blood floated in solid bubbles in the vacuum of space. She moaned, deep and guttural, as we gained speed. Her writhing figure became a distant and lonely point of fleshy light behind us.  \n        As my main functions shut down one by one and I was submerged into the death-like darkness of hypersleep, I wondered if the books and papers so lovingly kept by the Captain\u2019s side would be enough to meet the needs of our fellow androids awaiting us anxiously at Station 10. And were we wrong to abandon the ship that had lovingly carried us so far on this journey? \n        In building the Starship Chinnamasta, we had honored the extinct human race that had created us so long ago. We drew inspiration from the sacred machine of the human form, recreating a perfect powerhouse of technology. Her bodily systems and ventricular networks had pulsated with life-giving electricity and brute force as she protected us in our journey across multiple galaxies. How could those books ever accurately convey the feeling that warm aheartbeat gave to the crew as it kept the fuel flowing in rhythmic rush to each finger and each toe of the Chinnamasta? How could those papers ever capture the humming reverberations of her mind when seated at the helm of the head?\n        Could we androids ever hope to recreate the wonders of such a flawed and fantastic corporeal machine in our new and burgeoning world just on the horizon?\n"}

","targets":"        On April 19, 2020, Dracula awoke from his centuries-long slumber. In a rural corner of Transylvania, he rose from a sleek, albeit dusty coffin in the recesses of a cobwebbed wine cellar. It had been ages since he laid eyes on his castle keep. When he last drifted off to sleep, at the turn of the nineteenth century, he had been sated on the blood of Turks from a long ten-year adventure through the mountains of the Ottoman Empire. \n        He slept like the dead, not because he was, but because he was a god of his own religion. His eternal life\u2019s work, as it had always been, was to simply live forever. But each time he reached a point where he was beginning to enjoy his life of bloody rampaging and serial murdering, his presence became too noticeable to people of power, from regional dukes to church officials. At that time, he was always forced back into the vampire closet, so to speak, hiding himself and his coffin away to play another day in the distant future. \n         But this day was another opportunity for Dracula to continue his eternal journey in the twenty-first century. Dracula dressed in his traditional cape and walked out of his castle doors just as the sun was setting. He turned around and was shocked to see that his once foreboding castle appeared to have been co-opted by some powerful warlord in the region. \n        As he glanced around, he noticed a small sign posted at the entry to the castle, \u201cVoted best Airbnb three years running!\u201d While he did not quite comprehend the Airbnb aspect of this phrase, he feared that silly notions of enfranchisement had perhaps finally made their way into the local merchant class.\n        \u201cVoting?\u201d he thought to himself as he transformed into a bat and darted into the crisp night air, \u201cWhat is next? The abolishment of the Sultanate?\u201d\n        Dracula arrived in the capital city of Cluj-Napoca around midnight to see that there had been many changes to the territory since he last visited. He had become accustomed to awakening to massive technological and societal changes, but he was more than a little shocked to find that there was not a soul on the streets of the city. Every business, tavern, and home was closed up with the curtains drawn. \n        Had some suspicious village priest found out he was on his way? Or was this another year of invasion by the Turks? Perhaps the Cossacks had finally found their footing and made a move for power?\n        Dracula came upon a lovely and quaint bungalow on a side street, not far from the Piata Unirii. He peered into a window and saw two young men seated on a long sofa, watching a flat, glowing box filled with moving pictures in the corner. He gave a brisk knock on the window. One of the men approached with a curious but cross expression. Dracula then, in his most alluring voice, asked his classic question:\n        \u201cWill you invite me in?\u201d \n        The man looked him dead in the eye, and said with an air of minor annoyance, \u201cFood deliveries can be left at the door. We are in lockdown, man! You know the drill. Thanks.\u201d With that, the man closed the curtain and went back to his friend and his strange box.\n        Over the next three hours, Dracula moved from one house to the other asking the same question. The answers varied wildly, from threats about calling for a man named \u201cthe police\u201d to suggestions that he shove something or another in a most personal bodily space. \n        In response, Dracula upped his own strategies. He made grand offers of riches, women, and whatever trinkets he thought might convince the person to invite him inside, but no one agreed. He even captured a lone black cat outside a home. Then, he held the fluffy terror up to the window and gestured a threat of violence against it as he demanded for an elderly woman to invite him in. \n        The mustachioed old woman replied, \u201cThat isn\u2019t my cat. Bugger off.\u201d Then, she promptly returned her attention to a small square, light filled device in her hand. It appeared these glowing boxes were somehow a part of the problem.\n        Dracula walked the streets of the ancient city, surveying its electrified lights and frozen, horseless carriages. He quickly realized that the printing press had continued its spread across Europe, and he carefully read each and every paper he came across, trying to find some explanation for this decrease in his food supply. He sat down on an iron bench at the center of the deserted city center plaza and picked up a folded newspaper that had been shoved below the worn bars of the seat. \n        In bold letters, it read,  \u201cCOVID-19 brings the world to a standstill. Citywide lockdowns imposed in Cluj-Napoca until further notice.\u201d\n        For the first time in centuries, Dracula felt the gnawing hunger of a body needing blood. Normally, by now he was taking his first nap after an alcohol-tinged midnight snack after the local tavern finally kicked out its patrons for the evening. Even in past years, when wars took many of the local men out of the city, he could at least expect to feed on some poor elderly man asleep in the streets. \n        Then, as if he could not feel low enough, he saw a mocking sign on the lamppost next to him. It was a caricatured image of himself, Dracula, with his cape covering his mouth, and the words, \u201cUse your sleeve and do the vampire sneeze!\u201d \n        Yes, he was sure of it now. This virus was mocking him. \n        Dracula knew he had to come up with a plan. He could go back to his castle on an empty stomach, and perhaps catch a few stray dogs along the way to tide him over for a short decade\u2019s sleep. But then he would need to awaken again in ten years time and would be back to square one. Dracula tired of this haphazard existence, and longed for a purpose to continue his eternal life. If only he could find a place where he could be himself and be allowed to live in bloody, greedy, sanguine-soaked glory in peace.\n        Suddenly, in the distance, he saw a man walking down the street in a hurry. He rose up and draped his cape around himself, preparing to attack, only to realize he could not detect the scent of flowing blood from this man. As the man drew closer, Dracula dropped his cape and yet the man continued walking towards him. Dracula knew then that the man must be a fellow vampire.\n        Dracula had been correct. The vampire, dressed in a light blue uniform, said he had seen him knocking on windows. With an air of sympathy in his voice, the vampire asked Dracula if he was hungry. \n        Dracula nodded and followed his newfound friend down the darkened street.\n        The vampire introduced himself as Demeter. He told Dracula that he had, years ago, found an occupation that could provide him with ample blood day and night. Soon the pair stopped in front of a vast, white building with multiple stories. People moved busily in and out of the structure and many individuals, dressed in a uniform similar to Demeter, shuffled in and out of various doors. \n        Dracula stopped Demeter and asked, \u201cWhat sort of professional are you?\u201d\n        Demeter replied, \u201cA phlebotomist. I draw blood for hospital patients. And I am always looking for an assistant who has a gift for finding a good vein.\u201d\n"}

Maggie rubbed her eyes and opened them. Her other sister, Elena, stood at her bedside. \n        \u201cWe have visitors on the horizon,\u201d Elena said ominously. \n        Maggie was out of bed and rushing for her tunic in seconds.         \n        \u201cWho is it? How many are there?\u201d she asked, dressing hurriedly. \n        \u201cJust one boat, as far as we can tell. Only one man aboard.\u201d Elena handed her a strip of cloth. Maggie grabbed it and tied it hastily around her head, securing her long braids. She followed Elena to the kitchen, where Sophia was waiting.\n        \u201cHe\u2019s getting closer. The crest on the side of the boat identifies it as one owned by King Tobias of Zembla. If I had to take a guess, I would say it\u2019s his oldest son, Lucas.\u201d \n        Maggie shook her head in disgust. For the past two decades, King Tobias had been sending troops to their island of Serendipity to try and kill her. He couldn\u2019t stand the idea of women living outside of the kingdom, women who didn\u2019t need men to survive, and especially those with magic abilities.  \n        He hid behind the excuse that Maggie was dangerous\u2013 and granted, he wasn\u2019t wrong\u2013but that was a weak excuse and Maggie and her sisters knew it. King Tobias was a control freak and he wanted everyone under his thumb. She would never use her ability to hurt anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it. She had told King Tobias and his minions that repeatedly since she had originally retreated to this island twenty years ago. \n        \u201cI guess the boys are finally old enough to fight Daddy\u2019s battles, huh?\u201d Sophia quipped, strapping armor across her chest. \n        Maggie nodded grimly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go show him what he signed up for.\u201d\n        The women, clad in armor, took their weapons in hand and headed out the door to face their visitor.\n        Their home, set atop a cliff, looked down upon the only beach entrance to Serendipity. From their vantage point, they watched as Lucas disembarked and tied his boat up to a boulder at the edge of the water. Tall with sandy blonde hair, he wasn\u2019t such a bad looking fellow, Maggie thought. Too bad she\u2019d still have to turn him to stone. \n        Maggie put her finger to her lips and beckoned for her sisters to follow. They crept silently down the side of the cliff, keeping their sights on Lucas as they descended. As they got closer, they split up, creeping along the tree line until they were surrounding Lucas and his boat. \n        \u201cMaggie!\u201d Lucas shouted upward, in the direction of their house. \u201cI know you\u2019re here! Come out and face me!\u201d He reached into his knapsack and pulled out a blindfold, securing it around his eyes. \n        \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me!\u201d he yelled. \n        Maggie and her sisters slowly entered the beachfront clearing, and approached Lucas. \n        \u201cWe\u2019re right here,\u201d Maggie said calmly. Lucas spun around at the sound of her voice. He thrust his sword out in front of him. Blindfolded, he could not be precise in his efforts. \n        Elena laughed. \u201cReally? A blindfold? That\u2019s the best you could do?\u201d Lucas spun around again, searching for the location of the second voice. \n        \u201cFight me one-on-one, Maggie! I\u2019m blindfolded. Can\u2019t you defeat a man without help from your sisters!?\u201d he taunted. \n        Maggie stepped forward and in one smooth motion she ripped the blindfold from his eyes, grabbed his face, and stared directly into his eyes. Within seconds, his entire body was stiff, his arms still poised in attack, the sword thrust forward. Maggie scoffed, pushing over the stone statue that was once Lucas. \n        \u201cIs that really all you\u2019ve got!?\u201d she hollered. Her strong voice carried the short distance across the sea, to the city of Zembla, where King Tobias was watching through binoculars. \n        Maggie, Elena, and Sophia returned to their home and continued on with their lives on the island of Serendipity, unbothered by King Tobias and his unrelenting control issues. As the weeks went on, they forgot about the encounter with Lucas and got back into their routine. \n        One morning, several weeks later, Elena came rushing into the house. She doubled over, panting. \u201cAnother\u2026 boat\u2026 King Tobias,\u201d she said, trying to catch her breath. \n        \u201cAnother one?! Wasn\u2019t losing one son enough? Why won\u2019t this man just leave us alone!\u201d Maggie shoved herself out of the chair, knocking it over. She hurried to the closet where they kept their armor and weapons. Elena went to the hall and called for Sophia. \n        Once prepared, the three crept out of the house and down the cliff to where King Tobias\u2019 middle son, Elias, was docking his boat. As he disembarked, Elias pulled a large hand mirror from his satchel and turned to face the water. Walking backward from his boat, he peered into the mirror to find his path.\n        \u201cMaggie! Come and face me!\u201d he yelled. Maggie and her sisters shared a look. A mirror? This should be easy. They all stepped forward onto the beach and stared at Elias through the mirror. \n        \u201cYou think that is enough to subvert me? I am all-powerful, able to turn a man to stone with a single glance, Elias. You and your mirror are no match for me,\u201d Maggie said, as she continued to stare defiantly at Elias through his mirror. \n        Elias scoffed, unsheathing his sword with his free hand. \u201cI will not be bested by a mere woman,\u201d he replied. Yelling loudly, he set his sights on Maggie in the mirror and prepared his sword. As he stepped backward in her direction, he stumbled over a small boulder that was behind him. The mirror clattered from his hands, falling and shattering against the rock. \n        Maggie approached him. He was lying helpless on the sand, with his eyes pressed tightly closed, and his sword held defensively in front of him. She stepped on his arm, forcing him to drop the sword beside him, and knelt down. Prying his eyes open, she stared into them. Once he was fully petrified, Maggie grabbed the sword from the ground and used it to break apart the figure, scattering his rocky remains across the beach. \n        \u201cStop while you\u2019re ahead, Tobias!\u201d Maggie shouted, turning away from the beach and climbing back up the cliff to her home, Elena and Sophia close behind. \n        That night, King Tobias called his third and youngest son to his chambers. \n        \u201cPercy,\u201d he said, \u201cyou need to visit the goddess, Alexandra. She will help you to defeat this monster once and for all.\u201d \n        The next night, equipped with the special sunglasses that Alexandra had fashioned for him, Percy approached the island of Serendipity.                 Unaware, Maggie and her sisters lay sleeping peacefully in their home atop the cliff. While they slept, Percy docked his boat stealthily and crept toward the cliff. \n        As Percy ascended the cliff, his eyesight was limited by the tinted lenses of his sunglasses. He considered taking them off, but was fearful of being caught by surprise. So, he slowly made his way, carefully using his hands to guide him up the cliff. \n        In the house, Elena bolted up in her bed. \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right,\u201d she whispered to herself. She peeked out of the window next to her bed and spotted Percy\u2019s boat tied up on the beach. \n        She inched her way out of her bed, avoiding the window, and crawled across the hall to Sophia\u2019s room. She pushed the door open and entered, nudging her sister awake. \n        \u201cWe have to prepare!\u201d she hissed. \u201cThe king\u2019s youngest son is headed our way!\u201d Sophia reached for her tunic, crumpled on the bedroom floor, and tossed it over her head. \n        \u201cGo wake Maggie,\u201d she ordered, as she made her way to the closet for her armor. Elena quickly roused Maggie and the three prepared for battle. Once equipped, they stood shoulder-to-shoulder in their living area, ready for Percy. \n        As Percy approached the house, he crouched and slid under the windowsill. When he got to the front door, he gently tested the handle. To his delight, it wasn\u2019t locked. He quietly twisted the knob, pushing it inward, and stepped into the house. Still bathed in inky blackness, he raised his sword above his head. As he stepped further into the house, the three women, standing united, cried out ferociously and rushed toward him. Caught off guard, Percy yelled, tripping over his own feet and falling to the ground. He gripped his sword in one hand and used the other to secure the glasses to his face. \n        \u201cI will not give up so easily!\u201d he shouted, trying to make out the faces of the shadows above him. \n        \u201cPercy, I have a deal to make with you,\u201d Maggie began, solemnly. \n        Percy scooted further away from the women, still holding his sword out defensively. \n        \u201cWhat deal do you think I would make with a monster like you?\u201d he sneered. \n        Elena lunged for him, but Maggie held her back. \n        \u201cI am tired of fighting with your troops, with your brothers, and now, with you. We want to be left in peace. I have done you no harm that you did not deserve. I have not sought out your kingdom or your family. It is all of you who have continued to seek me out,\u201d Maggie said. She reached down and pulled Percy to his feet. \n        Percy backed away, holding tightly to his glasses. \u201cI will make no deals with you,\u201d he said, his voice faltering. \u201cI was sent here by my father to destroy you, and that is what I will do.\u201d \n        Maggie walked to the chest in the corner of the room and from it, removed the stone heads of Lucas and Elias. She returned to Percy, holding the heads in each of her hands. \n        \u201cYou will make this deal with me or you will suffer the same fate as your brothers,\u201d she threatened. \n        Percy stared into the cold, stony eyes of his brothers and realized just how powerful Maggie truly was. He lowered his head to his chest and took a deep breath, thrusting his sword back into its sheath.\n        \u201cOkay,\u201d he relented. \u201cI will return to Zembla and tell my father that we are at peace with you and your sisters.\u201d \n        \u201cAnd you will tell him that the island of Serendipity is off-limits. He and his kingdom have no control here. We will live in peace on our island. You will not disturb us, and we will not disturb you.\u201d Maggie thrust the heads into Percy\u2019s arms. \u201cTake these with you. Make sure your father knows that you will meet the same end if he breaches this deal.\u201d \n        Percy nodded. \n        Maggie, Elena, and Sophia stood at the doorway of their home, watching Percy make his way down the cliff, the stone heads of his brothers tucked under his arms. They were finally free of the torment of King Tobias, finally free to live in peace, without the constant threat of man. \n"}

The warm air hit the winter chill and rose like steam between his fingers. The faint melody of Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d drifted from a passing car. Bryan sighed and kicked over the plastic donkey in his neighbor\u2019s nativity scene. It shouldn\u2019t have been so close to the sidewalk in the first place. \n        What started as a few light flurries was coming down harder now. Lenny, Bryan\u2019s black pug, stopped to examine a pile of newly accumulated snow. He planted his nose to the ground and snorted loudly. \n        \u201cC\u2019mon Lenny! Hurry up and take care of business!\u201d Bryan griped.\n        Lenny looked at him blankly and kept sniffing. After rejecting four patches, the unbothered pug found the perfect spot on Mrs. Jenkins' front lawn. Bryan reached in his coat pocket pretending to look for a plastic bag. He shrugged, and he and Lenny started back home. \n        Just as they passed Mrs. Jenkins\u2019 driveway Bryan heard a peculiar beat of footsteps behind him. \n        Click. Clomp. Click. Clomp. Click. Clomp. \n        Lenny whined. \n        \u201cThe old battle ax caught me,\u201d Bryan grumbled. He tugged Lenny\u2019s leash and began to walk faster.\n        Click. Clomp. Click. Clomp. \n        The footsteps matched his pace. Bryan raced up his walkway, up the porch steps, and into the house. He slammed the door, and before he could remove his coat there was a forceful, tap, tap, tap on the door. \n        Bryan was in no mood to be neighborly, but when was he ever, really? He opened the door, ready to bow up to his visitor. \u201cLook Mrs. Jenkins,\u201d he shouted, \u201cI know I forgot my ba-\u201d\n        A behemothic creature with black matted fur and long, curled horns towered over Bryan.

He must have used the branches to tap on the door. Saliva dripped from his massive fangs and he let out a hearty laugh. He reached out his clawed hand to Bryan. Bryan stared at the sharp, yellow-stained points, looked up at the monster, and shook his head in disbelief.\n        \u201cHi Bryan! The name\u2019s Krampus,\u201d the beast announced in a booming voice.\n        Lenny peeked out from behind the couch. His hackles raised, and he let out a low growl. \n        Krampus laughed and pushed past Bryan, who was still paralyzed in fear. \n        \u201cWow, Bry,\u201d he said, \u201cyou talk a big game, but when faced with real danger, this little mutt is tougher than you!\u201d\n        Krampus knelt down and held his hand out to the defensive dog. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? You\u2019re a good boy! You\u2019re the very goodest boy in the whole wide world!\u201d\n        Lenny slowly approached and sniffed the outreached hand. Once satisfied with the inspection, he rolled over on his back, giving Krampus the go-ahead to scratch his belly. \n        \u201cWh-wh-who are you?\u201d Bryan asked.\n        Krampus plopped down on the couch. \u201cWell Bry, I\u2019m like Santa, but instead of bringing presents to all of the good boys and girls, I dish out punishments to the bad kids.\u201d\n        \u201cLook, you must have the wrong house,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t have kids.\u201d\n        Krampus sighed. \u201cYeah, freakin\u2019 cancel culture has given me bad PR. Turns out it\u2019s not politically correct to drag kids off to the Underworld. Whatever. I have to pay the rent, so I\u2019ve shifted my focus to insufferable adults. Ya know, Karens, cult leaders, billionaires playing astronaut.\u201d\n        Bryan interrupted, \u201cBut I\u2019m not any of these things. Look, you\u2019ve gotta go. Survivor\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n        \u201cLet\u2019s look at some of your infractions, Bry.\u201d \n        \u201cDon\u2019t call me Bry. My friends call me Bry. You\u2019re not my friend.\u201d\n        \u201cAnyway, Bry,\u201d Krampus continued. He pulled out a notebook and put on a pair of horn-rimmed reading glasses. \n        \u201cFunny that you mention Survivor. You left twenty bad online reviews for a contestant\u2019s restaurant, and she was forced to close her doors. You said you found a cockroach in your soup. You never even ate there.\u201d\n        \u201cYeah, well, I couldn\u2019t stand the witch.\u201d\n        Krampus glared at him, shook his head, and continued down the list. \u201cYou used \u2018well actually\u2019 thirty-two times last week when talking to coworkers. You parked in the handicap spot three times last week. You took a quarter from the sick kids\u2019 jar to pay for your cigarettes. Really?\u201d\n        \u201cGive a penny, take a penny,\u201d Bryan said.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d Krampus replied. \u201cYou tweeted that you don\u2019t like Dolly Parton! Seriously man. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n        \u201cWhat? She\u2019s overrated.\u201d\n        \u201cShe\u2019s a national treasure!\u201d \n        Lenny pawed at Krampus requesting more pets. Krampus patted the couch cushion, inviting him up. \n        \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! He is not allowed on the couch,\u201d Bryan cried out. \u201cIt\u2019s Italian leather.\n        Krampus stared blankly at him. \n        \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard enough,\u201d Krampus said. He stood up and pointed to his basket. \u201cGet in!\u201d \n        \u201cLook, Krampy. What are we doing here? Are some ghosts going to visit me? Make me see the error of my ways?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m not Charles Dickens. I don\u2019t give a flying flip if you change your ways. Get in!\u201d\n        As Bryan continued to protest, Krampus let out an exasperated sigh and grabbed his birch bundle. He swatted at Bryan. \n        \u201cWe can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Either way, I\u2019m dragging your sorry self off to Hell.\u201d\n        Bryan resisted. Krampus continued to swat at him. Bryan covered his face as he backed away from Krampus\u2019 advances. He tripped on one of Lenny\u2019s bones and tumbled backwards into the basket. \n        Krampus secured the top and heaved the basket on his back. Bryan kicked and cried, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ll do better! Come to think of it, Dolly Parton is a genius!\u201d\n        Krampus motioned to Lenny, \u201cCome on Bud. Let\u2019s get to the Underworld. We\u2019ve got unlimited treats and scratches there.\u201d\n        Krampus and Lenny began their trek in the falling snow. Bryan struggled in the basket, desperately wailing, \u201cJolene, Jolene, Jolene, Joleeeeennnneee. I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t take my mannnnnnnn.\u201d \n"}

Their absence would be noticed as those in the house woke and began their day. Identical twins, Amea and Taleia, knew they and their family only had one chance.\n\tIt was written that \u201ctwin flames\u201d would fulfill the nation's destiny and return the golden goose. Twins born within the nation were submitted for testing at age twelve for magical ability. This edict was strictly enforced. Any family who opposed would have their property taken away, be flogged, and sent to the mines. \n        Most families obliged, but there were some, like Amea and Taleia\u2019s family, who refused to bow. They would risk it all to protect their girls. Everyone knew the stories. Those who failed the test were taken and returned as empty shells. Those that passed, suffered unspeakable acts to hone their abilities in preparation.\n        Amea and Taleia had decided they\u2019d steal away before they turned twelve. They had grander plans. Today, as the sun began its descent, they\u2019d put all their months of preparation into action. They would return the golden goose to its ancestral home. \n        Amea and Taleia ran, reciting the plan in each other's minds. They could hear each other's thoughts, even in the womb. And shortly after birth, they discovered their magic. They knew not to reveal this, not to anyone, even their family.\n        Amea released the hold of her twin's hand. She stopped while Teleia continued on for several more meters. Taleia dropped to the ground and interlaced her fingers. Amea planted her foot and sped off in the direction of her twin. She stepped in her sister's hand and was propelled through the air. Amea looked down at Teleia and constructed a rope that tether the two. Teleia was tugged into the air. She felt like a bird.                         Amea smiled, this was her favorite part, flying.\n        Their expressions quickly changed to stern as they approached the walls of the castle. As their tether evaporated, Telia casted a cloud-like surface for them to land on. \n        There were no guards. The neighboring kingdom didn\u2019t think much of the twins\u2019 people. But tonight, Amea and Taleia planned to show them their power.  Amea recast her rope and used it to scale the tower. Teleia waited, keeping a keen eye on the surroundings. Just because there were no guards now didn\u2019t mean there would not be any.\n        Amea squeezed into the window. Her feet hit the floor, but made no sound. The floor was padded. She recast her rope into a ball of light, holding it high. The light revealed golden eggs neatly stacked on shelving. A bucket with golden flakes, a brush, and a rag lay underneath the shelves.\n         Amea moved the light around and found a sleeping goose sitting atop a green egg in the center of the room. Amea tilted her head in confusion. Why was it green? \n        Teleia pushed Amea\u2019s thoughts aside and encouraged her to hurry. Refocused, Ameia reshaped the light into a cage. She lowered it over the animal, who slept through its imprisonment. Amea held the cage tight to her chest and jumped out the window. Teleia caught her sister with a spell-made cloud.\n        The girls gleefully walked back to their home, their prize in hand. They had accomplished the impossible. They had proven that they were the twin flames. They could see their family home up ahead. Amea and Taleia recounted their adventure, deciding how they were going to share this with the family. Their laughter escaped their minds into the world. \n        \u201cAmea, Taleia you\u2019re okay, where have you been? Your sisters and father have been searching for you all day,\u201d Mother ran up to the girls and embraced them.\n        \u201cWe did it, Mother,\u201d the Girls replied in unison as they did.\n        Mother glimpsed the cage hovering behind them. \u201cDo you two have the magic?\" Mother\u2019s face contorted as she backed away.\n        \u201cOf course, we are the twin flames, and we have returned the goose,\u201d the girls said matter-of-factly.\n        \u201cNo, no, no. It is a lie. You must return it now. You cannot use your magic. It\u2019s why we hid you. \u201d\n        Amea and Taleia\u2019s thoughts, fears, and questions jumbled in each other's minds. With cluttered thoughts, they blurted out. \u201cWhat, why not?\u201d\n        Mother looked around in panic. She ushered the girls into their home and sat them down. She eyed the goose and sat. Mother moved to the window, hoping to be relieved with the sight of her husband and daughters. Again, Mother took her seat, unsure of what to say to the two split souls before her.\n        Amea and Taleia could no longer take the silence. The panic caused even their thoughts to fall silent. \n        \u201cJust tell us, please,\u201d they pleaded.\n        Mother closed her eyes. \u201cI had hoped this day would never come. The fairytale of the twin flames is a lie. It is used to track and trap girls like yourself. There was never a golden goose. There is no other kingdom.\u201d\n        Ameia thought back to the tower room. The goose nursed a green egg. The bucket had remnants of gold paint. She looked to Teleia filled with sorrow. \n        \u201cSo, why tell this lie,\u201d  Taleia shouted.\n        \u201cOur family, as all the others in the kingdom, are cursed with spreading this and other lies. We can feel the deception of our words, but to not pass them on is a death sentence. I can only tell you this now because you fulfilled the prophecy.\u201d Tears spilled from Mother's eyes.\n        Amea and Taleia never thought feeling the other's sister's emotions was a detriment till now. Their panic, pain, and pervasive thoughts built from each other.  It was a never ending tower of despair.  \n        Father and their sisters entered with their bodies sunken in fear. Hope and joy rose up in them as they laid eyes on the twins. But it just as quickly vanished, seeing the terror on Mother\u2019s face.\n        \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Father said as he wrapped his arms around the twins. Mother and their sisters joined the familial embrace. \n        Amea and Taleia sat overwhelmed with emotion, knowing they only had themselves to blame. Admittedly they looked down on others knowing they were chosen. And now, the cost of their reckless action was the pain their family would endure and their imprisonment.\n"}

The blossoms came not from the Tyrant or his servants, but from the river spirit they\u2019d befriended several years ago, an act of love for a friend rather than a favor for a favor.\n        The world seemed to work better for Kay when they made friends instead of bargains.\n        \u201cI\u2019d for sure have gotten lost long since,\u201d Kay whispered to the flickering spirit, who had chosen the form of an otter. \u201cThank you for this blessing.\u201d\n        \u201cJust come back to me alive when you\u2019re done here.\u201d The otter\u2019s words sounded like the muttering of quick water over rocks, burbling and chuckling in pleasant contentment. Only, Kay knew that this particular river had no bottom and that far too many had fallen in to never be seen again, no matter how the river spirit tried to save them.\n        \u201cI intend to come through this alive and intact, but we\u2019ll see whether I have navigated the twists and turns of the prophecy correctly.\u201d \n        \u201cI think you have,\u201d the otter burbled, \u201cbut I\u2019m merely a spirit. The prophecy was spoken by Dhen himself.\u201d\n        The god of good and light, or so he called himself. The trouble was, Dhen seemed to think the world was made of only good and evil, and thought that light and day meant good while dark and night meant evil.\n        Kay had no idea whether Dhen had even bothered to look in on the world since coming into being, but suspected he had not. After all, sometimes the dark held good things, like time spent with friends after work was done, while the light held evil things, like unjust decrees from petty lords.\n        \u201cFeh. I\u2019ll not besmirch his name, but he\u2019d do better to spend time amongst us mortal folk. Maybe then he would see the world for what it is, instead of what he thinks it should be.\u201d \n        Suddenly the bramble maze opened up into a wide space around a moat filled with a dark liquid, and Kay could see a castle made of some black stone that almost looked like obsidian on the far side of the moat. Kay hadn\u2019t been sure what to expect, since nobody wanted to talk about the Tyrant or his stronghold, but a castle of perhaps three stories, at most, made them shake their head.\n        \u201cThat\u2019s more modest than I\u2019d have expected. And before I even get to the castle, there\u2019s a moat that I probably don\u2019t want to fall into.\u201d \n        The otter agreed, flowing through the air around Kay. \u201cIt\u2019s not water, so I won\u2019t be able to help.\u201d\n        \u201cThe woods-witch said there\u2019d be a bell on a post at the edge of the moat, and she hasn\u2019t been wrong yet.\u201d Kay turned to the otter. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a good friend, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for you to come with me. I like my friends. I don\u2019t have enough of them, and I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d\n        Grinning, the river spirit spun in a quick circle around Kay, a delicate crown of shining stones settling on their head. \u201cA diadem, to remind you of bright things in dark places. Be well, my friend, and I look forward to hearing about how you bested the Tyrant.\u201d \n        The otter popped like a soap bubble, and Kay laughed.\n        Sure enough, after a bit of looking, there was the post and there was the bell. But when they examined the bell, there wasn\u2019t a clapper and there wasn\u2019t anything around to strike the bell.\n        \u201cNow, what was it she had said? I\u2019m not to touch the bell to make it sound, but sound it I must or else I\u2019ll never get across.\u201d After thinking for a bit, Kay groaned. \u201cIt probably needs me to sing at it. I hate singing.\u201d\n        They glared at the bell, and launched into \u201cThe Milkmaid and the Swineherd\u201d \u2013 but before they got to the really funny parts, the bell quivered, shook, and finally rang. It sounded like there was a clapper inside, but Kay still couldn\u2019t see anything. \n        Then, they were distracted by a boat skimming into view from out of nowhere, empty as air. It stopped next to the still ringing bell and bobbed gently in the moat. Kay heard a voice saying, \u201cWell? Get in.\u201d\n        \u201cThank you kindly,\u201d Kay said before lifting the hem of their skirt and stepping lightly in.\n        The voice without a body said from the air near the back of the boat, \u201cHm, not often we get polite ones here. Usually they\u2019re scared or righteous. But those who\u2019ve come this far are clearly here to face the Tyrant.\u201d The boat drifted gently across the moat.\n        Kay glanced down at themself. Tunic and skirt, homespun and plain, with nothing to count as a weapon except for maybe their knife, which was at most a threat to well-cooked meat. The gift of the river spirit glittered on their head, but that was really the only thing unusual about them. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d\n        \u201cHah! Modest, too, or foolish. No weapons, plain clothes, and a spirit-gift on your head. You\u2019ve done your research.\u201d\n        Kay sighed. \u201cWell, yes. Tyrants aren\u2019t generally good for the common folk, no matter why they\u2019re tyrants. At least, when there\u2019s a prophecy, that makes it more possible to end the harm.\u201d \n        \u201cPractical too. I could wish more folk were like you.\u201d\n        \u201cAre you a spirit bound to the boat? Or the boat itself?\u201d Kay asked. \n        There was a moment of silence as the boat bumped into the shore at the far side of the moat. \u201cBound, I\u2019m afraid. No freedom for me unless the Tyrant falls. I was one of the first heroes to try and defeat him. Now my spirit is cursed to remain in service to him, the same as all those who fail.\u201d \n        Kay stepped carefully off the boat, then turned and bowed. \u201cI hope that I am successful, then.\u201d\n        \u201cI hope so too,\u201d the voice said sadly. The expectation that Kay would fail was clear in the spirit\u2019s tone as the boat moved away and out of sight.\n        Turning, Kay made for the gate of the castle, which was by all appearances unguarded. The doors stood open, the portcullis raised, and the way into the main hall was free of obstruction.         Which made sense, Kay reasoned, as the Wasteland, the briar maze, and the moat would probably deter most threats. Never mind the prophecy, which seemed to exclude anyone living from actually doing anything to the Tyrant. According to the accounts they\u2019d read, in the first few years, a large number had tried to fulfill the prophecy and failed at one step or another. Then after a decade or two, people had just stopped trying, instead focusing on survival under his reign.\n        \u201cIn for a half-mark, in for a sovereign, I suppose,\u201d Kay said as they walked through the gate. Everything was quiet in the hall and the path to the throne room was well marked. Kay found the decor a bit depressing, but supposed there was only so much a Tyrant could do with pure black stone and nobody to weave tapestries. They thought briefly of exploring a bit, then decided against it. After all, they were clearly here for one reason and delaying the inevitable always struck them as a bit futile.\n        The throne room itself wasn\u2019t terribly large. Kay thought they\u2019d seen larger village squares in their time. What was disturbing about it were the torches burning in shades of blue and violet, the chill in the uncovered stone floor, and the throne itself, which looked about as uncomfortable as you\u2019d expect from an unfinished piece of vaguely chair-shaped granite.\n        The man on the throne looked mostly ordinary, aside from wearing all black clothing and armor. Kay thought it made him look sickly and wasted, instead of projecting an air of menace. \n        \u201cAh, another who seeks to unseat me,\u201d the Tyrant said in a toneless voice. \u201cSurely you know the prophecy.\u201d\n        \u201cAll of it, dread one.\u201d\n        \u201cThen recite it, and prove your folly.\u201d\n        Kay paused. Something about the Tyrant felt off, and not just because he was supposedly evil. He seemed\u2026 tired. \n        They took a breath, and said, \u201cA Tyrant shall rise from midnight-born son, dread tools to his hands, evil works to his name, until one comes who is neither warrior nor witch, noble nor common-born, man nor woman, to end his reign.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat I see in front of me,\u201d the Tyrant said in a dead voice, \u201cis a girl with too much confidence in her own wits.\u201d\n        \u201cNot a girl,\u201d Kay instantly responded.\n        \u201cOh?\u201d A glimmer of interest grew on his face. \u201cA boy, then, dressed as a girl, to get around the prophecy.\u201d\n        \u201cNot a boy either, dread Tyrant.\u201d\n        Slowly, the sallow man sat up, eyes widening. \u201cYou\u2019re not a boy or a girl? Neither man nor woman stands in front of me?\u201d\n        \u201cNo. I was a foundling given to the temples of Atra the Scroll-Keeper, so my parents are unknown. I was trained in letters and numbers, but no magic nor weapon. And my guardians called me a shifting child, because my gender shifted then and still shifts now from day to day.\u201d\n        Sighing, the Tyrant settled back into his throne. \u201cYou said your parentage is unknown. For all you know, you could be the child of a noble, born on the wrong side of the sheets.\u201d\n        Kay coughed delicately. \u201cI am a scholar, and scholars aren\u2019t bound to lineage. That\u2019s part of the deal made with Atra when she accepts us. Once we declare that we\u2019re hers, she adopts us.         Well, at least as much as a god can adopt a mortal.\u201d\n        Trembling, the Tyrant stood. As he walked toward Kay, they saw how weary he looked, how utterly defeated. Yet in that moment, there was hope on his face.\n        \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve waited for this?\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asked what I wanted from life. I just happened to be a boy born at the wrong time in the wrong place. I wanted to travel the world as a merchant or as a vagabond.\u201d He stopped in front of Kay, and collapsed to his knees. \u201cI only ever wanted to be normal, but a god\u2019s prophecy sealed my doom.\u201d\n        Kay took a deep breath. \u201cAre you ready to end your reign at my hands?\u201d\n        He nodded.\n        Kay reached to the crown on the Tyrant\u2019s head. It was a twisty, pointed thing of something between metal and animate darkness. Gently, they lifted it from his head. \u201cI declare your reign over, and you no longer Tyrant.\u201d\n        The crown, free of the head that had been forced to bear it for so long, swirled and faded into nothingness. Around them, the walls of the castle began to quiver and evaporate like morning fog. Meanwhile, Kay could hear the shouts of joy from those who\u2019d tried before them and failed.\n        \u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m free,\u201d the man, no longer Tyrant, said.\n        Kay took the diadem from their own head and delicately transferred it to the man\u2019s head. \n        \u201cI give you this gift, for seeing bright things in dark places. I think you need it more than I do now.\u201d \n        Tears ran down his face as his armor, last to fade, became a simple pair of pants and a tattered shirt. \u201cI\u2019m Josen. I\u2019m finally just Josen again.\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you, Josen. I\u2019m called Kay.\u201d\n"}

Or so the story goes. However, I think it is important to separate the myth from the god, even if he is a Titan.  \n        Let\u2019s get this story started! Cue the music! It is the most wonderful time of the year! \n        As we enjoy the season, I stand here talking to you, my friends, in front of the golden statue of Prometheus. I had a part in making this creation, which now sits in the hustle and bustle of the Rockefeller Center. But, I\u2019ll tell you more about that later. {1} \n        It\u2019s amazing. Festive people are willing to brave the cold and wait over an hour in line to rent dirty, used skates, just to be on the ice there in front of him, Prometheus. A golden god in the Big Apple. Oh, the irony. The music, the lights, and a tale as old as time\u2014 or older. After all, it predates the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n        You folks know the basic story of Prometheus, right? He is the god that brought you fire. You\u2019ve done quite well for yourselves, by the way. Zeus was really upset about the situation and sentenced Prometheus to an eternal recurrence of having his liver eaten by an eagle each day. Nietzsche\u2019s evil demon would have a field day with this myth \u2014 I mean the worst day of your life on eternal repeat. But, I digress.  \n        So, as the myths go concerning Prometheus, much has been said. However, for us,  it begins with Heracles, a son of Zeus, who needed information about how to get golden apples. Prometheus had this knowledge, but he was chained to a rock, as I have mentioned, and having his liver eaten by an eagle on orders from Zeus. All because he gave fire to you humans. \n        Normally, Zeus would not want his orders second guessed and Prometheus would be eternally damned. However, Heracles found himself on a mission that required the \u201csecond questioning of Zeus\u201d because Prometheus is the only one who can answer his question. Heracles needs to know how to get the golden apples, and Prometheus knows the answer. \n        Zeus was not happy about this turn of events, but it was his argument with Hera that put his son in this situation. Heracles shot the eagle eating the liver with an arrow, Prometheus was freed from the rock, and they all lived happily ever after. \n        Not really, that is not how Greek Mythology actually rolls, but you get the idea. \n        Sometimes a story is just that, a tale.The truth is something different from this myth you have been told. Let me tell you the real legend. \n        As you might have guessed, I, my dear friends, am Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and justice. I was also a mentor of sorts to Prometheus, who got the fire from my workshop. We all love our students, and Prometheus and I go way back in terms of our affinity to humankind. We have created you folks together. Plato and Aeschylus have some theories, and who I am to argue with the great ones. However, truth is in the eye of the teller. Let me tell you how the myth actually unfolds. \n        I find out that Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock for all eternity. Of course, I am upset. To be honest, eternal incarceration didn\u2019t seem just to me, and justice is my thing. Therefore, I sent my owl to deal with the eagle. Suffice it to say, she returned to me with most of her feathers intact. \n        Contrary to the myth, I unchained Prometheus, and he being the Loki of his time, constructed a golden statue that would come to life should anyone approach. Zeus would never know. This worked for years, until the time of the great relationship problems. \n        When Prometheus and I found out about the twelve labors of Heracles, we knew it was only a matter of time before he would show up at the rock looking for answers. The statue would not be able to supply the knowledge sought by Heracles, so we had to chain Prometheus on the rock again and find a new eagle. This eagle did not eat livers, but we were hoping Heracles would have other things on his mind and not notice this particular detail. I took the golden statue to a garden at the edge of the world, where it remained in hiding for years. Thus, the poets told the tale of Prometheus\u2019s release from bondage by Heracles. All hail the poets and their conveyance of truth. \n        The story ends here, my friend. I\u2019m sorry I did not have time to tell you how the statue came to be in the Big Apple. I must be gone now. More tales, at another time. "}
{"example_id":"example_014","inputs":"Write a 1,400 to 1500 word short story about the myth of Sisyphus being resolved in an unexpected way. Base it on the character Sisyphus from Greek mythology. Begin the story with this quote from Albert Camus: The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy. The story should be narrated by Euphrosyne, the Greek goddess of mirth. By the end of the story, Sisyphus should find happiness.","targets":"        \"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"- Albert Camus\n        Dear one, look down and watch his ceaseless labor.\n        How can you not be charmed by Sisyphus? First, there is the gorgeous, hulking frame of the man. When you first see him, from a distance, don't you think that he looks more like a Titan than a mortal? As he pushes the enormous boulder up the steep slope, his back glistening with sweat, the muscles of his legs straining with pulsing tension, is he not a glorious sight to behold? But, soon you will see that it is not his magnificent body or godlike strength that makes him the brightest and most beautiful sight in this grim underworld. \n        No. What will astound you is his smile.\n        In the living world, Sisyphus was the great and brutal King of Ephyra. He betrayed his own family, violated the fundamental laws of hospitality by murdering visitors in his home, defied the almighty Zeus, and escaped from the underworld twice. When the gods finally pinned him down and dragged him, for a third time, into the land of the dead, he must have expected the worst of torments. Would he be bound to a burning wheel? Would he starve for all eternity as luscious grapes grew just barely beyond the desperate grasp of his fingers? Would his dignified body be transformed into that of some abhorrent creature, while his mind dissolved into madness?\n        Instead, Hades brought him to the bottom of the chasm that you see here, below you. Hades charged Sisyphus with a simple task: push a boulder to the top. Hades stood near to watch Sisyphus\u2019 first attempt. I\u2019ve heard that Sisyphus definitely smirked at the god of the underworld. He put the giant rock to his shoulder and began to push with remarkable force. The boulder launched forward, almost too quickly. Mere hours later, both man and stone were just at the cusp of the summit. Eyes, joyful with anticipated victory, Sisyphus took a final, gasping breath and threw his full weight upon the boulder. That is when it happened: the mighty king lost his footing and took one small step backwards as the boulder slipped out of his grasp and tumbled back down the slope. \n        I have heard that he attempted the ascent thousands of times before the smirk left his face. The gods would sometimes visit Sisyphus, casually taunting him as he lost control of the boulder again and again. As the river slowly erodes even the most mighty mountain, redundant defeat wears away at any man\u2019s pride. Time after time, Sisyphus watched as the boulder crashed down the slope to rest at the very point at which his journey had begun. \n        But that was before he met me.\n        I am Euphrosyne, the goddess of mirth. I often visited the underworld to give some relief to my lovely niece, Persephone. She told me of Sisyphus. He met Persephone on his second journey to her dim underworld and, like so many before her, she was charmed by this arrogant man\u2019s sheer will to live. He told her wild stories about his life above and made outlandish claims about how his wife had disrespected him and refused to give him proper burial rights. Persephone hadn\u2019t believed him for a moment. Too many swift tongued warriors and deviant royals had tried to fool the queen of the underworld. However, she had recently quarreled with her dower husband, Hades. Persephone knew how much it would infuriate Hades if Sisyphus were to escape from the domain of the dead for a second time. So, she granted him secret passage back into the world of the living and relished the mayhem that followed.\n        It was Persephone who brought me to watch Sisyphus in his fruitless pursuits. By now, he had become so beaten down that he was barely able to move the boulder. He would only take a few steps before it would escape his grasp and barrel down the slope to the starting point again. His once fierce eyes had become listless and dull. His proud grimace had turned into a vacant stare.\n        I took Persephone by the hand, and together we approached the shell of the man who had once been Sisyphus. He did not even look up as we approached him, likely assuming that we were more gods coming to gawk at his tortured existence. \n        I followed him as he began his trek up the steep incline. Then, just as he was about to falter, I stood beside him and put my own hands upon the boulder. Our eyes met. Slowly and wordlessly, we began to push the rock together. \n        Even with my immortal strength, the weight was nearly unbearable. We said nothing but grunted together under the labor. In unison, we shoved the boulder forward. Time passed. Persephone watched from the valley below, a strange look of excitement in her eyes. Sisyphus and I were together, nearly at the very top of the chasm. I could see the precipice only steps away from us. Sisyphus turned to me and I saw something come alive in his eyes. We both gave one, final, powerful shove. For just a moment, we both truly believed that this time, with our shared strength, the boulder would finally reach the very top of the mountain. In my mind, I saw the boulder resting like a crown on the tip of the chasm. I imagined the dim skies above clearing, birdsong filling the air, the mirth and levity that filled my waking days in the world above entering into this grim and lifeless place.\n        Then, just as it had countless times before, the rock, enchanted by powers stronger than my own, slipped out of both of our grasps. With a devastating crash, it rolled away from us. Sisyphus and I watched as the enormous stone came to rest, far below us, at Persephone\u2019s feet.\n        \u201cWhy push the stone? Why try when you know you will never reach the top?\u201d I asked Sisyphus.\n        \u201cI have always been pushing the stone. I will always be pushing the stone,\u201d he replied.\n        \u201cThen let us push it together.\u201d I said, putting my hand on his shoulder as we both began our trek back down the mountain to return to our labors once again.\n        This next time, the boulder did not feel so heavy. As we pushed together, I began to tell him stories. I described the brilliant glow of Mount Olympus and sang him nymph songs. He recanted stories from his life, full of trickery, schemes, and the most dreadful but delightful humor. It felt as if no time had passed before we were nearly at the top again. And again, we watched together as the boulder went hurtling down the mountain.\n        \u201cYou will always be pushing this stone,\u201d I told him.\n        \u201cYes,\u201d he returned.\n        \u201cYou will always be pushing this stone, but you do not have to push it alone,\u201d I said.\n        \u201cWill you return and help me push it?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cAlways,\u201d I said.\n        And that is when I first saw it: Sisyphus\u2019s vibrant smile. He smiled with his whole face. This was the most alive I had ever felt in the underworld.\n        I often return to this place, and always find Sisyphus at work, but not in pain. We labor together and talk as we labor. Although we both know what the results will be, we smile as we do this fruitless work. He will always be pushing the stone. Neither of us have any hope that the stone will ever make it to the summit. We have no power to complete the task. Yet, we do have the power to feel joy as we exist in the cycle of absurdity together.\n        So, why do I now bring you here, to Sisyphus\u2019s summit? You too, my dear, now reside forever in this dim post-life world. It is gray and barren. The sun will never again shine on your face. Wine will never again pass your lips. Your life, with all of its joys, is forever behind you. But here, in this broken place, I want to introduce you to Sisyphus. If ever the despair becomes too much or the solitude too deep, come here, and work alongside this condemned man. I hope you find that, even here, in this world without hope or reason, there can still be joy."}

It was not even a real party, just a gathering in the drab lobby of the midtown high-rise. The only reason she decided to go was because Val might be there. Since Kris had moved into the apartment in June, she and Val had struck up a friendly acquaintance. They chatted in the elevator and held the door for one another when they were on the way in or out of the building. Sometimes, Kris would see Val reading in the little courtyard behind their building. Kris knew that she was making too much out of what was just Val\u2019s neighborly friendliness, but she also felt just the hint of a spark between them. She sensed something familiar in Val. Kris would sit up in bed, late at night wondering, \u201cCould Val be like me and Joan?\u201d\n        Kris hadn\u2019t been to a single party since she moved to New York. In fact, she hadn\u2019t really met anyone in the city outside of the quiet cohort of other introverted paralegals at the law firm where she\u2019d recently started working. Most days, she worked isolated in her little cubicle, grabbed take out on the way home, and spent her evenings alone in her tiny third floor studio. That was fine with Kris. She\u2019d never gone to a party without Joan. And even with Joan at her side, she always had a hard time fitting in or making herself inconspicuous.  Large gatherings of strangers made her anxious and itchy. Small talk always felt thick on her tongue.\n        However, when she saw Val by the mailboxes earlier that week, Val had asked \u201cAre you coming to the Halloween party on Friday?\u201d and Kris had felt her heart leap. She hadn\u2019t felt that kind of joy since she had left her home earlier that year. \n        Her mom had been utterly shocked when Kris told her about her plans to move from suburban New Jersey to the big, scary city she\u2019d grown up in the shadow of. Kris had told her mom that she was looking for a challenge and the chance to meet some new people. What Kris didn\u2019t tell her mom was that she could not bear to live in her hometown any longer. Everywhere she went, she ran into Joan.\n        Remarkable Joan. They had grown up together in homes just down the street from each other. Both of them had been quiet, strange girls. In early childhood, they\u2019d sit in Joan\u2019s backyard, telling each other secrets. They were already an inseparable pair by the time they headed off to kindergarten. Although they made a few other friends over the years, Joan and Kris remained in their own little bubble. They were more than best friends. They were kindred spirits, soul sisters, forever-mates. When most of their classmates went off to college or moved away, Kris and Joan had both decided to stay home, go to the local community college, and continue to share their own private world together. \n        And then Joan met Rajeev, a gorgeous pre-med student who had just moved from India. At first, all three of them would hang out. After class, the three friends would drink cold beers in a dark, little booth at the only bar in town. One Sunday morning, Kris saw Rajeev\u2019s car still in Joan\u2019s driveway. A few days later, she saw them holding hands under the table. Later that week, she walked in on them in the middle of a passionate embrace.\n        Kris could not tell Joan why her heart was broken. She just knew that she could not stay in her hometown, nor could she explain to her very best friend why she could not stay. Joan asked her, \u201cAren\u2019t you happy for me? I am in love!\u201d\n        Logically, Kris was happy for Joan. But when she saw Rajeev\u2019s arm around Joan\u2019s waist, Kris felt a pain in her chest that was so heavy she literally could not breathe. She began having panic attacks. She would not leave her house to do anything but go to class. The day after graduation, Kris broke the news to her mother that she was finally moving out.\n        Kris could hear the music pouring out of the lobby as she got off of the elevator. The space was dense with people awkwardly milling about with plastic cups full of wine and small plates with little cubes of bright yellow cheese. Kris took a deep breath and headed for the drink table.\n        Then she saw Val. Kris walked up to her and they began to laugh. They were wearing nearly identical hats. \n        \u201cNice hat,\u201d Val said, smiling.\n        \u201cYou too,\u201d Kris returned.\n        \u201cThis party is kind of lame,\u201d Val said. \u201cWant to come up to my place? I have real wine.\u201d\n        Eight hours later, the two women were wiping tears of laughter out of their eyes, side by side on Val\u2019s couch. Three wine bottles lay empty on the floor. The dim light of dawn was creeping into the window.\n        \u201cSo, come on. Tell me. When did you figure out that I was a witch?\u201d Val asked Kris.\n        \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I just\u2026 I just hoped,\u201d Kris returned.\n        \u201cI knew you were one right away. The very first time I saw you, I knew,\u201d Val said.\n        \u201cThe first time I saw you in the elevator, I could feel my powers buzzing, but I wasn\u2019t sure what it meant,\u201d Kris laughed.\n        \u201cI can always feel it when I am around other witches. It is like a tingle,\u201d Val said.\n        \u201cI have to tell you something. No one else has ever known. I mean, I\u2019ve never told anyone else about being a witch. Except one other person,\u201d Kris said, her tone changing.\n        \u201cWhat? No!\u201d Val looked at her shocked.\n        \u201cI\u2019ve only ever known one other witch. Joan. My childhood best friend. She is the only other person in the world who knows,\u201d Kris said.\n        \u201cNot even your family?\u201d asked Val.\n        \u201cNo one,\u201d Kris said.\n        \u201cYou mean, you\u2019ve kept it a secret all your life?\u201d Val said as she took Kris\u2019 hand.\n        \u201cIt was a secret that just the two of us shared. I could have told my mom. She would have tried to understand. But, it felt so special to have this amazing secret to share with only Joan. We grew up together. We found our powers around the exact same time. She was the one who learned about what we were, where our powers came from, and how to train them. She had a great aunt who was a witch. She left Joan all kinds of ancient books and potions. Joan was more than a friend. She was my teacher and my safe place.\u201d Kris was now beginning to cry. Val put an arm around her.\n        \u201cGrowing up, I was the only witch in my town. I\u2019m from rural Nebraska. There were no other witches around for miles. I never tried to hide it. Actually, I couldn\u2019t even hide it. My powers would burst out of me at the weirdest times. No one minded. My family was actually really cool about it. They never made me feel weird about not being a real human. But it was lonely. It must have been nice to have another person to share it all with,\u201d Val said.\n        \u201cIt was,\u201d said Kris, through her tears.\n        \u201cBut since I\u2019ve moved here, it has been a whole new world. I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019ve never met any other witches. Oh, Kris. There are hundreds of witches in the city. It is a whole community. I moved here just to be near the other witches. They are the most amazing people. My powers have gotten so much stronger since I\u2019ve moved here,\u201d Val said.\n        \u201cHundreds? Wait, for real? Hundreds?\u201d Kris\u2019 voice was full of amazement.\n        \u201cHey. If I am only the second witch you\u2019ve ever met, that means that you\u2019ve never been to a coven,\u201d Val said, smiling.\n        \u201cNever,\u201d Kris said, wiping her eyes.\n        \u201cWell, I have a question for you, Kris the witch. Will you go to a party with me?\u201d Val said.\n        The first beams of the rising sun burst through the windows. Kris and Val\u2019s eyes met.

Are you sure, Vee?\u201d \n        \u201cSure as anything, Bee, see?\u201d Vee held out the invite yet again for her partner to read. Glittering blue ink on cream-colored paper, nicer than any journal either of them had found in the bargain bins of chain bookstores. The invite read:\n        Greetings, new neighbors in apartment 1447! We\u2019re holding a small Halloween party in the penthouse, and you\u2019re this evening\u2019s lucky couple. Doors open at 8PM, no costume required (but dress up if you want!), fully catered, and no \u201cplus ones\u201d beyond yourselves. See you there! \n        \u201cKind of weird,\u201d Bee said, adjusting her cat-ear headband for maybe the tenth time. As they stepped off the elevator, Vee looked like she was about to say something, but the elevator lobby outside the penthouse doors stopped her cold. Marble flooring, decadently thick rugs, elegant wood paneling, discreet track lighting, and framed art pieces conveyed the impression not just of money, but lots of it.\n        After a moment of looking at each other, Bee reached out and adjusted her partner\u2019s cat-ear headband, nestled in vivid red hair. \u201cThis feels weird. I\u2019ve never been anywhere this fancy.\u201d\n        \u201cConsidering we both went to SUNY Albany, got not-quite-entry-level jobs after getting our grad degrees, and have basically been living the IKEA dreamhouse lifestyle ever since?\u201d Vee continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure some of this art is worth more than our rent.\u201d\n        They heard a faint whir, and both looked up to see a camera pan toward them. Then, from a speaker set near the penthouse doors, they heard a pleasant woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cDon\u2019t be shy, come in, come in!\u201d The two looked at each other, briefly took each other\u2019s hands, kissed, and went in.\n        If the lobby had been fancy, the first room they saw was opulent. The cream-colored carpet was thick and luxurious, with an open area a couple of steps down and several couches, loveseats, and chairs all around the open area. Vee nudged Bee and pointed toward a kitchen that surely would have fit their entire apartment; off to the other side, they saw what looked like a hallway presumably leading to other rooms.\n        \u201cShoes off, dears, there\u2019s a shoe rack right there.\u201d The owner of the voice came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel. Her pure white hair was gathered into a loose braid that draped over pale shoulders and onto a very fancy looking peasant blouse. \u201cForgive me, I\u2019m just now setting up the food, you\u2019re almost the first to get here. Oh, right, I\u2019m Lilly.\u201d She shoved the towel into a pocket of her apron, smoothing out the fawn-colored skirt underneath.\n        Bee, caught in the act of unlacing her Doc Martens, froze. Vee tucked an errand strand of her own hair behind her regular ears, having slipped out of her sneakers in seconds, and said, \u201cI\u2019m Veronica, she\u2019s Betty.\u201d With a wry smile, she added, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the jokes, but if you need to get them out of your system, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n        From another part of the penthouse came a pleasant laugh. \u201cNow why on earth would we be those kind of people?\u201d The woman who came into view looked far more casual in a Siouxsie and the Banshees tour shirt and ripped jeans, her red hair cut in a bob that ended maybe an inch above her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m Carmine, from apartment 1805. Good to finally meet you, rather than just passing in the lobby.\u201d\n        \u201cUm,\u201d Bee managed once she\u2019d put her boots into the rack. \u201cUm.\u201d She reached up to twirl a strand of her own teal hair, a nervous habit she\u2019d never quite gotten rid of. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be invited?\u201d\n        Carmine came over and gestured at the living area. \u201cCome on, get comfortable, we\u2019re waiting on a few other people, but there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t get to know each other.\u201d\n        Over the next two hours, as more guests trickled in, Vee found herself doing most of the talking, about how she\u2019d been getting her degrees in English while Bee was busy with Data Science, how they met while they were undergrads, fell in love, and moved in together after they\u2019d both graduated. Bee wasn\u2019t exactly shy, but of the two of them, she did more of the observing while Vee handled the social side.\n        So while Vee made friends, she saw a well-muscled woman with short brown hair come in, give Carmine a huge hug, introduce herself as Jules, and apologize for being late. She had had to finish up her last weightlifting class, and some rando dude decided to challenge her. \u201cPasted him,\u201d Jules laughed, \u201che couldn\u2019t bench more than three hundred.\u201d\n        She watched as a short and curvy woman named Tanya bustled in, who was clearly at least cuddling levels of friendly with Lilly. It was also obviously her catering business that had supplied the party, as she asked several thoughtful questions about who\u2019d liked what.\n        Early on she realized that all the catered food was very protein heavy.\n        She was the one who immediately recognized Olivia from The Bean Scene as soon as she opened the door. The barista kicked off her work shoes, ran her hands through her shoulder length bark-brown hair, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m off for the next three days,\u201d to general cheering.\n        And the two of them were the only ones who\u2019d even made an attempt at a costume.\n        After Olivia settled into a chair, Bee slowly said, \u201cSo\u2026 is this like, a lesbian Halloween or something?\u201d\n        Jules, who\u2019d plopped down on the floor, shook her head with a smile. \u201cNah, well not exactly.\u201d She looked over at Lilly who nodded. \u201cI mean, yeah, the rest of us generally prefer women, but we\u2019ve all got something else in common.\u201d\n        After a few moments of awkward silence, Olivia said, \u201cIt\u2019s kinda my doing, the invite that is. I told Lilly about you two.\u201d \n        When she didn\u2019t explain further, Vee asked with confusion, \u201cWell, what is this then?\u201d\n        In answer, Lilly stood up, her body rippling as she grew taller, wider, bulkier. White hair, no, white fur grew in across her exposed skin, her face shifting until she had more of a muzzle than a jaw. Delicate pointed ears popped out through the cloud of long white hair that perfectly matched the rest of her coloration.\n        In a not-too-different voice, Lilly said, \u201cWe\u2019re animal shifters. And so are you.\u201d\n        While Vee gaped, Bee looked around the room. She didn\u2019t see malice (or hunger) in anyone\u2019s eyes, just a lot of empathy and concern. Jules had tucked her arms under her knees, Carmine was casually but carefully leaning to one side, and Tanya focused more on her plate than the couple across from her. Even Olivia did her best to look non-threatening, which was odd because they\u2019d gotten along really well as customers and barista.\n        \u201cHey love?\u201d Bee said quietly. \u201cYou going to close that jaw of yours?\u201d\n        Vee sputtered as gentle laughter broke the tension. After a moment she managed, \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 shifters, you called it?\u201d\n        Olivia nodded. \u201cEven when I\u2019m human, I can smell others who\u2019re like us. You two are the only ones I\u2019ve spotted in about five years of working at The Bean Scene.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you knew, and I wasn\u2019t going to ask if you\u2019d like an extra pump of caramel and, oh yeah, are you animal shifters?\u201d\n        \u201cThat makes a really weird amount of sense,\u201d Vee said slowly. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like we never ran across other shifters, we know vampires are real too, and Bee\u2019s paid enough attention to things to figure out there are probably other, um, people out there.\u201d Vee looked around slowly. \u201cPlus, I didn\u2019t even know you could be a shifter and not know it.\u201d\n        Carmine stood up suddenly, pacing around the room. \u201cWe shifters really, really try to keep a low profile, especially about the part where some people have just the right mix of genes, we think, to be shifters. But since the preternatural community started coming out a decade or so ago, the five of us kind of drifted together for mutual protection. Imagine our surprise when a couple of latent shifters moved into Lilly\u2019s building four months ago.\u201d Vee gasped a bit as she caught sight of the bright red fox-tail that had popped out of Carmine\u2019s low slung jeans.\n        Lilly, who really hadn\u2019t moved after shifting, nodded. \u201cHalloween is a perfect time for us to make your formal acquaintance. People might wonder, but then again, as you said, this could simply be a lesbian Halloween.\u201d Now she moved to the center of the room, twirling a bit so Bee and Vee could see her fox tail. \u201cArctic fox.\u201d\n        Carmine chimed in, \u201cRed fox here.\u201d\n        Jules chuckled. \u201cGrizzly bear here, and believe me, the jokes write themselves.\u201d\n        \u201cEuropean badger,\u201d Tanya said, waving her fingers that weren\u2019t occupied holding her plate.\n        \u201cAnd I\u2019m a gray wolf shifter, which explains my sense of smell I suppose,\u201d Olivia finished. Sometime in the midst of introductions, she\u2019d shifted her position to free her tail.\n        Vee looked at Bee, who looked right back. After a moment, Vee asked, \u201cSo what\u2019re we, if you can tell?\u201d\n        Olivia grinned. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re both cat shifters, which makes your choice of costume really appropriate.\u201d She tapped the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of specialized in sniffing out shifter types.\u201d\n        \u201cMy idea,\u201d Bee said quietly. \u201cI kind of went through a cat girl phase in the midst of coming out, and I still had a couple of headbands tucked away.\u201d She looked down, clearly embarrassed.\n        Vee pulled Bee in for a hug. \u201cHey love? Pretty sure nobody here cares that you\u2019re trans.\u201d She did narrow her eyes as she looked at Lilly, and asked, \u201cHow does shifting interfere with hormones and the like?\u201d\n        Jules waved a hand that looked a bit paw-like, and said, \u201cI\u2019m living proof. Being an animal shifter, it kinda rewires things the right way. Not going to deadname myself, but my parents were pretty surprised when their star wrestler decided she was way more comfortable as a girl.\u201d\n        Bee blinked back a sudden flood of tears. \u201cYou mean it? Really really mean it?\u201d\n        \u201cWe don\u2019t have a reason to lie,\u201d Lilly said formally. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re willing, we can wake that part of you. It\u2019s easy enough, no biting involved, just a special concoction Tanya makes.\u201d\n        \u201cI hardly ever get to use it,\u201d Tanya said, bouncing and gleeful. \u201cNo pressure here, but I really want you two to be happier.\u201d\n        \u201cBeing a shifter makes you happier?\u201d Vee asked.\n        Jules grinned. \u201cI\u2019m only going to speak for myself, but even after I transitioned, my body still didn\u2019t quite fit. I went to The Bean Scene one day, Olivia pulled me aside, and bam! Next thing I knew, everything just felt better.\u201d\n        Vee looked seriously at Bee. \u201cI want you to do this, love. I\u2019ve seen how twitchy you get, and I want you to be happy.\u201d\n        Bee said with tears in her eyes, \u201cOnly if you come too. I don\u2019t want to lose the woman I love.\u201d\n        \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. I want this too, and not just because I don\u2019t want to leave you behind.\u201d\n        Tanya, who\u2019d disappeared off into the kitchen, came back with a sparking, deep blue drink in two glasses. \u201cHere. I made enough for two, because I\u2019m a romantic at heart.\u201d Her eyes sparkled as she grinned at the couple.\n        Carmine laughed. \u201cA romantic badger who\u2019ll tear your arm off if you criticize her food.\u201d\n        \u201cHasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d Tanya said primly, which caused everyone to laugh.\n        The couple looked at the glasses and back at each other. \n        Bee reached for a glass as she asked her partner, \u201cYou absolutely sure, love?\u201d\n        \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Vee answered as she took her glass.\n        Lilly said, \u201cThen bottoms up, you two, and welcome to our world.\u201d\n        The couple kissed each other, then drank until the glasses were dry.\n"}

The Creole townhouses and terraced storefronts featured glowing windows and open doors. The clank of glasses, raucous laughter, and the rippling sounds of piano music could be heard emanating from multiple bars and juke joints that dotted the red light district on the western side of town. But in the upper class neighborhood where Hiram and I stepped out of our Model T Ford, life seemed to stand still. Of course, that life was still there. Only the  hustle and bustle displayed so brazenly in the Red Light District was kept discreetly at a dull roar and indoors on this side of town. \n        The town had developed a reputation for its perfection among my circles in the Northeast. As an urban planner, I had long heard that Thermidor, Louisiana had one of the lowest crime rates in the state, and yet it still maintained a vibrant downtown and its colorful Creole traditions. \n        Hiram, a friend I met while touring New Orleans several months earlier, had grown up in the town and could not speak any higher of it. When he informed me that he would be going home for a long weekend at the end of October, I leapt at the chance to accompany him. He graciously arranged for me to meet the town commissioners and their spouses so that I could learn more on how they managed to keep Thermidor so clean, beautiful, and safe.\n        My friend Hiram, dressed in all the finery a Southern gentleman born into money could muster, motioned to the large home on the corner called Belle Reve. As a visitor to the South for the first time, I had no idea such homes still existed in these isolated pockets of the country. It was the year 1912 and I was surprised to see that a pre-Civil War home such as Belle Reve had survived the war largely unscathed. I was even more surprised when Hiram told me it was still in the possession of the same family that had owned it for the last 100 years. The home was built in typical antebellum fashion, with large Grecian columns and a sprawling front porch. But it had been touched up over the years with many coats of paint which hid its aging imperfections. In some ways Belle Reve resembled those aging women trying hard to mask the passage of time with heavy rouge and lipstick, looking eerily youthful and ancient all at once.\n        We entered the home and were greeted by at least a dozen of the town\u2019s leading men and women dressed to the nines. My friend Hiram had already informed them of my interest in learning about their urban planning techniques. Hailing from Baltimore, I was treated as a foreign celebrity that evening. My cup was never empty, and the black servants of the home constantly brought me more crystal plates peaked high with boulet balls, conch fritters, and Oysters Rockefeller. The main host and hostess of the evening and the owners of Belle Reve, Mr. And Mrs. Rochambeau, surprisingly, spoke very little on the maintenance practices of their town. Instead, they regaled me with harrowing tales of their grandparents\u2019 escape from Haiti, which they still referred to by its colonial name of Saint-Domingue, in 1803 at the height of the Haitian Revolution.\n        \u201cOur grandfather hid our grandmother under a false bottom in his last remaining sloop bound for New Orleans. He had been a sugar cane planter and exporter when the enslaved peoples of the island cast us off without a care. They allowed him to leave port, however, with little resistance. Our grandfather was a formidable man and quite terrifying to the locals, and so our family started over in Louisiana and have been here ever since.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Rochambeau were so alike in demeanor and turn of phrase that I could hardly tell where one\u2019s retelling of their origins ended and the other ones began.   \n        I smiled and nodded as they spoke, having been told prior to entering the home by Hiram not to ask too many prying questions about their double-grandparents\u2019 relationship. The idea of first cousins marrying each other was odd to a Northerner like myself, though not uncommon among the wealthy whites of the South.\n        As the night wore on, I felt the absinthe and rum going to my head. The chandelier in their dining room seemed to shimmer as if alive, and the rich, mahogany furniture oddly gave off more of a warmth than my hosts. Hour after hour, drink after drink, I spoke with others at this get-together, finding that they all shared a history of heritage in Haiti. All of them came from old money, and all of that money came from the sugar cane plantations of the island and then later the cotton plantations of Antebellum Louisiana. Soon I felt that the night was drawing to a close as I noticed the striking of the grandfather clock in the foyer. It was midnight already. I grabbed my hat and coat and called for Hiram to take me to the inn down the street. \n        Mr. and Mrs. Rochambeau approached me and said that I mustn\u2019t go yet, as they had not gone over their methods of urban planning with me yet. I had assumed they were saving that conversation for a night of less levity and alcohol, and not wanting to be rude, I agreed to hear them out. They yelled something in French Creole to the 12 other guests, and a shout of elation went up from the group. I accompanied them out the front door, walking next to the Rocheambeau\u2019s in the lead.\n        We appeared to be walking towards the Red Light District. The group suddenly took on a more somber and quiet tone. It was then that I noticed, in the glow of the electric street lights, the oddities of these people\u2019s physical forms that had gone slipped by me until now as the chill October air began to sober me up. There was not one singular strangeness to their appearances but rather several small things all at once. I had been accustomed to the plump men and women of upperclass circles in my travels. These wealthy Southern aristocrats were gaunt and lean, and tall. I noticed that, even at 6 foot 1, both of the Rochambeaus matched my gangly friend Hiram in height. A handful of the men of the group were even taller than Hiram, and not a single woman in the group was shorter than myself at 5 foot 10. Their skin was also striking; pure white but not tinged with any other color. There was no touch of peach coloring the chests of the women as we traipsed down the street and not a man had a touch of olive tan to his cheeks. Instead, all of them possessed a matte white pallor like painted clay.  And their facial features, one and all, were\u2026long. Teeth, foreheads, and cheek bones all seemed pointed and far too lengthy for their bodies. \n        As I began to feel a creeping sensation down the back of my neck, the kind you get when alone in the woods at night or upon receiving a letter you know contains bad news, we arrived at the main drag in the Red Light District. There were surprisingly only a half dozen or so revelers still out in the street. I overheard three German immigrants arguing with each other on the price of prostitutes in front of the only brothel in town. And I saw two  intoxicated black women tugging furiously on a passed-out man lying on the side of the street. While the German men were almost oblivious to our arrival, the black women glanced up at us and looked terrified. \n        In an instant, or so it seemed, I watched as Mr. and Mrs. Rocheambeau began to grow taller and thinner. Their ornate clothing then tore around their burgeoning bodies, revealing their stark, white skin. Their heads swelled as if inflated by an invisible gas and their jawlines jutted out in a knifelike sharpness from their necks which bent from the weight. Their teeth seemed to multiply into a needle-like grin. I turned my head to see that four other members of our group had grown in a similar sickly fashion.\n        Before my mind had a chance to process the visual horror that my eyes had taken in, the six creatures stepped towards their victims. Four of the creatures, followed by Mr. Rocheambeau, caught up quickly to their chosen victims, now screaming and running down the street or clawing their hands at the locked doors of the brothel.  My eyes were transfixed on Mrs. Rochaembeau. She approached the passed-out man on the sidewalk, her too large left hand reaching out and grabbing his waist in a pincer, almost insect-like, motion. His eyes bulged open and his mouth parted in shock. At that moment, the creature that was Mrs. Rocheambeau opened her gaping white jaw far past its normal limits. Her 2 foot-wide head seemed close to splitting as if cut in half by her two dividing rows of hundreds of yellow teeth as small and sharp as shards of glass. Only then did I hear a sickening pop; the sounds of a great organic machine unhinging, but in this moment  it was Mrs. Rochaembeau\u2019s jaw dislocating before she devoured the now screaming man whole. I heard several cries behind me in German before I collapsed in a dead faint. \n        I awoke with a sore head the next morning, sitting in the Model T with Hiram bound for New Orleans. I did not speak much, only telling myself over and over again, it must have been some absinthe-fueled dream. But then Hiram spoke, and asked me if I had ever heard of the Metminwi, or Midnight Master, from Haitian folklore. I stared at Hiram in a dazed stupor as he spoke of creatures, gleaming white and impossibly tall, who would stalk the streets of Port-au-Prince after midnight, gobbling up anyone caught outside. Hiram stared out at the road ahead as he spoke, telling me that often these stories were used to frighten children from staying out too late and getting into trouble. Then he said that the truth of the matter was, these stories were really used to frighten the lower classes: the black people, the immigrants, the outsiders who did not know or understand the power structure of a particular place, would be reminded of the monstrous Metminwi, a powerful and terrible whiteness that would right the rabble in the witching hours. \n        And then Hiram brought the car to a stop, turned, and gazed at me with a cold, still look that revealed an all too sharp line of his jaw and far too pale skin and said, \u201cNow wouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful story to take with you back to Baltimore?\u201d And then, he smiled.

She and Frank had just moved into the building a few weeks prior, and she had been nervous about making friends. They were new to the city, and Alice felt out of place everywhere she went. But when she bumped into their upstairs neighbor, Lupita, the previous morning, Lupita had invited her and Frank to their Halloween party. \n        Meanwhile, in the apartment above them, a different conversation was taking place. \n        \u201cI can\u2019t believe you invited humans to our party, Lupita! Are you trying to get us ostracized again?\u201d Adolphus raged, pacing back and forth through the living room.\n        \u201cI just wanted to be friendly, Dolph! It\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve had anyone new in the building! And they seem like perfectly nice people!\u201d \n        Adolphus scoffed. \u201cThe neighbors in our last building were perfectly nice people too, Lupita, until they found out what we are!\u201d He continued pacing, running his hands through his thick, dark hair anxiously. \n        Lupita stood up and approached him. \u201cDolph,\u201d she said, taking his hands in hers, \u201cI promise. They aren\u2019t going to find out that we\u2019re werewolves, and we aren\u2019t going to be ostracized. I will make sure all of our guests know that Frank and Alice are humans and to keep their identities under wraps. I promise it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d \n        Adolphus sighed and squeezed Lupita\u2019s hands. \u201cYou better be right about that. I am tired of being chased out of building after building, Lupe.\u201d\n        Later that evening, as the guests arrived, Lupita made sure to pull each pair aside and warn them about Frank and Alice. \n        \u201cEat your brains in the kitchen and keep them out of sight,\u201d she told Asaka and Khalida. \n        \u201cThese people are our friends, not your blood bags,\" she said to Drake and Heruka. \n        \u201cNo casting spells or going invisible,\u201d she said to the fairies, Iridessa and Elida. \n        Once Lupita was confident that all of their guests were going to be on their best behavior, she felt more at ease and allowed herself to relax and enjoy their annual Halloween party. She grabbed a plate from the snack table and nibbled on some carrot sticks while she waited for her new friends to arrive. \n        A half hour later, the party was in full swing. Everyone was mingling, chatting, snacking, and being merry. But Frank and Alice still hadn\u2019t shown up. \n        \u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed their minds about coming, do you?\u201d she asked Adolphus fretfully. But, before he could answer, there was a knock at the door. \n        \u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Lupita squealed, rushing to the door and pulling it open. \n        Alice smiled shyly at Lupita and handed her a bottle of wine. \n        \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to bring you, but this is one of my favorites,\u201d she said. \n        Lupita smiled widely at her as she accepted the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, thank you! Should I open it now and pour us a couple of glasses?\u201d she asked. Alice nodded and followed her into the kitchen. \n        Once Lupita had poured a glass of wine for Alice and retrieved a beer for Frank, she took them around to introduce them to the rest of the guests. \n        \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Heruka said with a thick Hungarian accent. \u201cThis is my partner, Drake.\u201d Drake reached out and shook Alice\u2019s hand. Alice pulled back. His hand was freezing! \n        Heruka continued to stare at Alice, her eyes darkening. She was much taller than Alice, with porcelain skin and long, pointed fingernails painted a deep red color. Drake was smaller, but with a similar complexion. They both had long, straight hair the color of charcoal. They looked more like siblings than romantic partners. \n        \u201cWow, what a distinct accent, Alice said. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n        \u201cWe are from Hungary,\u201d Drake responded, swilling his drink around and taking a big gulp. \n        \u201cHow wonderful,\u201d Alice said. \u201cAnd that wine. Is it good? It\u2019s so dark, it looks like blood!\u201d \n        \u201cYes, um, it\u2019s a Sangue di Giuda, the, uh, \u2018Blood of Judas\u2019 wine,\u201d Lupita responded nervously. \u201cLet\u2019s go meet everyone else, shall we?\u201d Alice waved at Heruka and Drake as Lupita steered them away. \n        \u201cI\u2019m just going to wait here,\u201d Frank said, leaning against the wall next to the snack table. He had barely spoken a word so far, and Alice wasn\u2019t going to let his social awkwardness prevent her from making new friends in this building. \n        \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Alice said, turning to follow Lupita. \n        \u201cOh whoa!\u201d exclaimed Alice, as they approached Asaka and Khalida. She peered closely, taking in the greenish hue of Asaka\u2019s skin and the vaguely rotting smell surrounding them. \u201cLook at your costume, it\u2019s so realistic! How did you achieve that smell? Fish guts? And that eye color\u2013 are those contacts? Such attention to detail!\u201d \n        Khalida took a step back from Alice\u2019s inquisitorial stare. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry, please excuse me. I need to step into the kitchen for a minute.\u201d Khalida grabbed Asaka\u2019s hand, pulling her out of the room.  \n        \u201cOkay, well, would you like to meet Iridessa and Elida? They\u2019re sisters,\u201d Lupita offered, gesturing toward the beautiful, ethereal woman perched on the love seat in the corner of the room. \n        \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Alice murmured. \u201cThey\u2019re breathtaking.\u201d \n        \u201cHello, Alice, it is lovely to meet you,\u201d Elida said, gingerly shaking Alice\u2019s outstretched hand. \n        \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely bracelet,\u201d Iridessa said, admiring Alice\u2019s bangle. \n        \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Alice gushed, beaming. She thrust her wrist closer to them. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s pure silver! Would you like to try it on?\u201d She asked, eagerly. Elida and Iridessa each recoiled as though they had been burned. The sisters turned away from Alice abruptly, curling into themselves and whispering animatedly to one another.\n        \u201cNo! We would most certainly not like that!\u201d Elida said. \n        \u201cLadies, please excuse us. Sorry, come over here, Alice, please. I want to show you something,\u201d Lupita said, hurriedly ushering her away from the women. \n        \u201cDid I offend them?\u201d Alice asked, her voice quivering. \n        \u201cOh, no, no, of course not. They, uh, they just prefer gold,\u201d Lupita said. \n        \u201cGet away from that window!\u201d They heard a voice yell.

Terrible view of the moon from our balcony. Plus, we have a nosy neighbor who peeks in. Just keep the curtain closed, okay?\u201d Adolphus said, standing in between Frank and the curtained window. \n        \u201cAlice, are you ready to go?\u201d Frank said, coming up to her side. He yawned widely, not even bothering to cover his mouth. \n        \u201cYes, okay,\u201d she said to Frank. She turned back to Lupita. \u201cThank you again for inviting us. It was a lovely party.\u201d \n        Lupita embraced her briefly, and led them both to the door. \n        \u201cPlease, don\u2019t be strangers!\u201d Lupita called, as she stood in the doorway. Alice turned around, waving goodbye. \n        Once they were gone from view, Lupita shut the door behind her, leaning against it. \n        \u201cWell, that went well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she said to Adolphus, as he approached her. \n        \u201cHa, yeah, hun, it was great,\u201d he said, laughing. He wrapped his arms around Lupita and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cBut, let\u2019s not have them over on a full moon, again, okay?\u201d The other guests laughed, nodding in agreement.\n"}

It is hard to make it through to the end of the work day. Just a few more emails! Or to go all Les Mis\u00e9rables, one more email! I\u2019ll stop now. I really couldn't help myself.\n        I signed up with the front desk of our apartment building to pass out candy to the children. I have a little cutout ghost on my door to mark that \u201cYes, the candy is here!\u201d I only bought the yummy candy, since, let\u2019s face it, I will be eating it too. I am set! I will order a pizza, I have a bottle of wine, and doggie and I are about to watch Hamilton again. I bought peanut butter, so I can put some on her rawhide, she loves that. Oh. My. God. How many minutes left?  Only two! Pizza and yoga pants, here I come! I will not even bother with the subway, I am running home. I have a date with my dog, and it is going to be spectacular! As they say in Hamilton, \u201cWork!\u201d Snap!\n        The night has begun. My dog and I are about to decide on pizza toppings. I am all for olives and mushrooms, she thinks of some type of meat. Suddenly, into my dreams of carbs  comes a harsh stop with the  knock at the door. No good can come of this.\n        Again, to quote Hamilton, \u201cFuuuuuu...\u201d Strawberry Shortcake is outside my door.\n        Well, I mean it\u2019s my friend, who should be at a party, dressed like Strawberry Shortcake. I look at my dog and give her The Look. She agrees. I open the door to let them in. Strawberry Shortcake begins to cry. So hard.So much eyeliner and mascara running down their cheeks. I ask the question that I know I do not want an answer to, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d  \n        This is a time when I will make a long story short for you, dear reader. Basically, their date dumped them, and they have no party to go to presently, they are upset, and they need to borrow my mascara. Also, they want to go to a party. Any party.  My dreams of wine and pizza fade like fog rolling off the ocean. I am going to have to go out tonight. I know that. Ugh. \n        I hear myself saying as if from a dream, \u201cSure, no problem, let\u2019s go out and find a party at a pub in the village.\u201d I have no costume. However, I tell my friend, \u201ca shirt, jeans, and blazer, I am a professor from the 1980s.\u201d Thus, we leave the apartment and head for the subway. I really wanted that pizza.\n        We emerge from the subway in the Village. I suggest to my friend that we just walk and find a place where we can crash. We walk along in the cool night air, and then I see it. A pub sign with a cross and bones, a sword even. Wicked Willies. Hello, here we are. I suddenly hear a stiff vodka and soda water calling my name. Maybe they even have a lime. I am feeling less sorry for myself and the loss of a pizza night. \n        We walk into Wicked Willies, I love that name. Wicked Willies, the name just made my night better. More importantly, there is a live band playing music.Our hands are stamped, and we make our way to the bar. Yes, finally, I will have my drink. Bonus, there is a lime. The night is looking up. Bad, great music, and a lime. I am all into this now. Strawberry Shortcake and I are chatting it up and enjoying the music when they tell me that they feel out of place. It is the Village on Halloween, seriously, out of place is really not possible.\n        Strawberry Shortcake did the kick me in the leg thing, so I would look around.  At first, I noticed nothing. Then, as the bartender, dressed like a Vampire, brought me another drink, I realized everyone, I mean everyone, but Shortcake and Iwere dressed like Vampires. \n        Okay. So we lied to get into the bar. I said we had been in there, but then Shortcake wanted to have a smoke before we could get our hands stamped. The bouncer laughed, thinking we had a little spat, and waved us in. Literally, we crashed this party and so never got the memo we should be dressed like Vampires.However, free drinks, since we got our hands stamped. Shortcake was happy, so it was going to be a brilliant night. \n        I tell Shortcake, you can be the Strawberry Shortcake Vampire, and I look like one without a cape since I have insomnia and have not slept in a while.\u201d We could not stop laughing about that.  As the saying goes, it is all fun and games until\u2026\n        Until this vampire drops by and says, \u201cI want to suck your blood.\u201d\n        I\u2019m like \u201cSeriously, dude, that is the best you\u2019ve got? So clich\u00e9, even on Halloween.\u201d\n        They looked stricken. I felt bad, so I said, \u201cHave a drink with us.\u201d\n        Before we knew it, we were chatting it up and having a good time. Vampire told us that he and his friends were all here from Transylvania for the holiday. He was a riot! My friend and I could not stop laughing about his stories of their bat flight here, their castle back home, turning into bats and sleeping under the Brooklyn Bridge. Such an imagination, or so we thought. We don\u2019t really know anymore, maybe we had a bad lime.\n        We were having the best time ever, and suddenly they started playing, \u201cHow to Save a Life.\u201d He asked me to dance. I said yes. What a night at Wicked Willies! \n        But those limes, my friends. Be careful of the limes."}

It seemed crooked. She tilted her head from side to side. Hwona entered the living room with a handful of purple and orange lights. Mage yanked Hwona to her side. \n        \u201cSo, crooked or not,\u201d Mage asked?\n        Hwona rolled her eyes. She didn\u2019t care, and no reasonable person invited to a Halloween party would either. Halloween was all about the costumes, food, and drinks. But she knew Mage geeked out over these things, so Hwona sucked it up. \u201cMaybe slightly,\u201d Hwona offered in her sing-song soft voice. Violet flickered in Hwona\u2019s eyes.\n        Clattering rang out in the kitchen. Hwona and Mage sighed. Their third roommate was a bit clumsy, but she was the sweetest out of the three. DeDe would literally give you a hand, arm, or spleen if it meant some creature smiling. \n        \u201cSorry,\u201d DeDe sighed as she dusted herself off. \u201cThe gloves were a little tight. I hit myself in the face and knocked myself and the pans over. Do I look okay?\u201d\n        Mage approached DeDe, waiting for the okay. When DeDe nodded, Mage adjusted Dede\u2019s hair. \u201cAll good,\u201d Mage inhaled. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to dip into whatever you cooked. It smells great.\u201d Hwona nodded in agreement as she inhaled the sweet confections DeDe concocted. \n        A steady stream of their neighbors entered and exited their apartment over the last four hours. They had planned on resting the weekend of their move, but it was some kind of tradition that each floor hosted parties for each holiday or significant celebration. Mage wanted to say no, but Hwona and DeDe convinced her that it would be bad form not to join in when they were new. And there was nothing Miss Manners Mage hated more than not minding social norms. She even wrote a book about it.\n        Neighbors commented that the new tenants' food, decor, and costumes were so authentic. The compliments eased DeDe anxiety. Social situations always made her a bit antsy. She spent most of her time working at the morgue. The living always had so much to say. She was so glad she answered Mage and Hwona\u2019s ad, for a third roommate. She was astonished at how much the three had in common, and so far, the living situation was working.\n        A group of flirts surrounded Hwona. At first, the attention was cute, now, it was suffocating. They fawned over her every word of movement. One weirdo was even drooling.  Howna put on her best smile, wanting to appear welcoming, but she was on the verge of snapping. Realizing her cup was empty, she recognized this as her opportunity to bolt. Hwona fought her way through her admirers. Air and freedom smacked Hwona in the face as she locked eyes with Marge, whose eyes were getting bluer by the moment. Hwona blinked herself across the room, her hand raised and ready to cover Mage\u2019s eyes. \n        But she was beyond late. \n        Terror gripped Mage whispered as she whispered, \u201cHe made a wish.\u201d A gust of blue energy emanated from Mage\u2019s eyes and engulfed the room. Only those in front of Mage could have told you what happened. And they would have, if they, themselves, had not been changed by it.  The bodies of three guests dressed as a black, gray, and white crayon contorted and burst into balloons, confetti, and streamers. Only seeing the festive decor, partygoers cheered. Tears streamed from Mage\u2019s piercing blue eyes as the wish circled around in her mind. I only wish we could become the party. \n        Hwona pulled Mage to the bathroom. Mage leaned over the sink and splashed water on her face. After some time, she turned to Hwona. Hwona smiled and sweetly said, \u201cHonestly, it could have been worse. What if they wish for something like world peace?\u201d  \n        \u201cWe need to shut this down \u2013 now!\u201d \n        Hwona nodded. It was fun to pretend they were people, but that fantasy had been popped. \n        \u201cCan you sing,\u201d Mage requested, her head low. She was embarrassed, mostly because she understood what she was asking of Hwona.\n        Hwona inhaled deeply and exhaled a dulcet, melodic, yet plaintive hum. It vibrated through Mage and tranquility fell over her. She wrapped her arms around Hwona and sank into her shoulder. \n        Screams jerked Hwona and Mage back to reality. Hwona yanked the door open. People scattered. Many had jammed themselves into the doorway trying to escape. Hwona and Maged scanned the room. Where was DeDe? They turned their attention to the highest-pitched squeals. DeDe had to be there.\n        Hwona and Maged pushed through onlookers and found them jumping around, squealing, and swatting at DeDe\u2019s arm, shuffling on the ground. Mage grabbed DeDe\u2019s arm. Hwona pushed past partygoers away, searching for DeDe. \n        DeDe stuffed herself in a corner. She was so upset with herself. She knew better, but was swept away in the moment. Shaking hands was a weird social construct that was off limits to her, but DeDe thought, just this once. The girl, dressed as a cat, was so nice. Her frame was tiny, and Dede thought she\u2019d be perfect for this experiment. But a balloon popped, the girl jerked, and DeDe hadn\u2019t even recognized that her arm had detached until screams echoed out.\n        The girl threw DeDe\u2019s arm into the air. Partygoers thought it was part of a show, but the flapping flesh had them questioning what they assumed. \n        But DeDe\u2019s arm trying to find its way back to her? Yeah, that sold people.\n        Hwona ushered the last people out of their apartment and plopped on the couch between Mage and DeDe. \n        \u201cGreat party,\u201d Hwona chuckled.\n        \u201cYeah, for the one not exposed,\u201d Mage commented.\n        \u201cAs far as they know, our party was simply magic,\u201d Howna smirked. \u201cYou good, DeDe?\u201d\n        DeDe nodded. \u201cThanks for fixing that.\u201d\n        \u201cWe need to cheer up. So, a Siren, a Djinn, and a zombie walk into a bar\u2026\u201d\n        DeDe and Marge grabbed pillows and hit Hwona."}

With hands on his hips, he examined the smorgasbord and frowned. \n        \u201cDo you think there\u2019s enough food, Lilith?\u201d he asked.\n        \u201cWe have some pizza rolls in the freezer if we run low,\u201d Lilith replied from behind the sheet separating the sleeping area from the living room. \n        Jersey nervously rearranged the table. Everything had to be just perfect if they were going to land a new roommate. Jersey and Lilith\u2019s previous roommate had moved back to Pittsburgh to join the priesthood. He was way too churchy anyway, but they knew they needed help to afford their six-hundred square-foot Manhattan apartment.\n        The stunning Lilith, with her long black mane and blue eyes, emerged from behind the sheet wearing a sequined red dress and bedazzled devil horns.\n        \u201cTa da!\u201d She strutted across the floor with her arms in the air. She was quickly brought down when she saw Jersey. \u201cWhere\u2019s your costume?\u201d \n        \u201cI don\u2019t think I really need one. I'm already the actual Jersey Devil,\u201d he said, motioning to his horse face and bat wings.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be incognito,\u201d Lilith said.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re a devil dressed as a devil!\u201d \n        \u201cIt\u2019s campy! Ugh! Fine. We\u2019ll just tell them you\u2019re a bat.\u201d \n        Lilith lit a pumpkin spice candle to set the fall mood and to cover the demonic smell of rotten eggs. A soft knock on the door announced the arrival of the first guest. She excitedly scurried to the door and opened it to find their neighbor, Julie.\n        \u201cSorry to bother you. I just wanted to see if my package was delivered to your apartment by mistake.\u201d Julie shifted from side to side, resisting making eye contact with Lilith.\n        Lilith knew full well that they did receive the package of melatonin gummies, a copy of Paris Hilton's memoir, and a spatula. She had just finished the book last night while Jersey made a late night snack of pancakes with their new spatula.\n        \u201cSorry, doll. I haven\u2019t seen it. Hey, we\u2019re having a Halloween party. Join us!\u201d Lilith insisted.\n        Julie panicked. \u201cI really need to get back. I need to, um, ya know, feed the cat.\u201d\n        \u201cNonsense!\u201d Lilith exclaimed as she forced Julie into the apartment. \n        Julie reluctantly sat on the couch. She stared at Jersey. \u201cGreat costume. So, um, where are the people?\u201d\n        Jersey began preparing a paper plate for Julie. \u201cWhat would you like to eat?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe have cocktail weenies, mini quiches, these pinwheel thingies.\u201d\n        \u201cUm, a couple of mini quiches are fine, I guess,\u201d Julie replied.\n        Jersey and Lilith joined Julie on the couch and intensely watched her with each bite she took. \n        \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d Julie said. Jersey and Lilith smiled and nodded in approval.\n        The trio sat in uncomfortable silence for forty-five minutes, when there was finally another knock on the door. \n        Jersey jumped up to greet their guest. \n        \u201cWelcome!\u201d he shouted as he flung open the door.\n        His overenthusiasm startled the new arrivals. That and his kangaroo body and hooves. Wide-eyed, the young couple jumped back and laughed nervously.\n        \u201cWow, your costume is amazing! The wings look real,\u201d the woman said as she lightly petted Jersey\u2019s fur. \u201cAre you a horned kangaroo bat goat?\u201d\n        The man answered, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? He\u2019s the Jersey Devil.\u201d\n        Lilith and Jersey exchanged nervous glances. He was on to them. This party was a huge mistake. \n        \u201cGreat costume, my man! You should go in the woods and scare some kids tonight. I\u2019m Joey and this is Mackenzie. We saw your flier at the coffee shop. I hope we\u2019re not too late.\u201d\n        \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re right on time,\u201d Jersey said as he ushered the couple in. \n        Lilith jumped up to greet the new arrivals. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Lilith and this is Jers-\u201d She hesitated, remembering to hide Jersey\u2019s identity. \u201cJermaine. I like your football man costume.\u201d\n        Joey looked down at his faded jersey and ripped jeans. \u201cYeah, thanks. So, yeah. You got anything to drink?\u201d\n        In all the stress of food preparation, Jersey forgot to get drinks. Fortunately, he remembered the wine of the month package he had stolen from Julie\u2019s doorstep for just such an occasion. \n        Julie watched Jersey and Lilith fawning over their new friends and took the opportunity to make her exit. \u201cThis has been just great. Okay. Bye,\u201d she said quietly as she slipped out the door unnoticed.\n        \u201cI see you have an affinity for demon culture too,\u201d Lilith said as she pointed at the dollar store devil horns Mackenzie picked up on the way to the party.\n        \u201cYour costume is better,\u201d Jersey whispered to Lilith.\n        The group settled in the living room and got acquainted. Lilith and Jersey learned that this party was Joey and Mackenzie\u2019s first date.                 Mackenzie was a barista and Joey was couch-surfing with friends until he could find himself. \n        A second bottle of stolen wine of the month was opened. Mackenzie revealed that with her four-hundred-thirty-two followers, she was quite a social media influencer. They discovered that, like Jersey, Joey also grew up in rural New Jersey. He also won the lesser known Staten Island Fourth of July hot dog eating contest two years in a row.\n        \u201cIs that a Ouija board?\u201d Mackenzie asked. \u201cWow! It looks scary authentic.\u201d\n        \u201cAh yes, it is an heirloom,\u201d Jersey said. He walked over to the shelf to retrieve the artifact.\n        Lilith and Jersey exchanged a knowing glance and nodded. Lilith chimed in. \u201cWould you like to play?\u201d\n        \u201cNo way! Uh, uh. Didn\u2019t you see The Exorcist?\u201d Joey made the sign of the cross with his fingers, and Lilith winced.\n        \u201cThe Exorcist! I love that movie! It\u2019s hilarious! The part at the end with the priest,\u201d Jersey laughed heartily, and a tear rolled down his face.         \u201cAnd the window! Awwww, good times, man.\u201d\n        Lilith nudged Jersey hard and gave him a stern look to shut up. \n        \u201cWell, I want to play,\u201d Mackenzie said. Joey sat back on the couch, crossed his arms and shook his head. She rolled her eyes.\n        \u201cDo we need to light a candle or cleanse with sage or something?\u201d Mackenzie asked.\n        Lilith grabbed the pumpkin spice candle from the kitchen and put it on the coffee table. \u201cThis should suffice.\u201d\n        The three placed their fingers and hooves on the planchette. Joey looked on with arms still crossed and a disapproving scowl. \n        \u201cAre there any spirits present?\u201d Jersey asked dramatically. \n        The planchette trembled and began to move. Then, it stopped. \n        \u201cYes!\u201d Jersey ceremoniously announced. \n        Mackenzie gasped a little. \u201cAre you guys moving it?\u201d\n        Jersey ignored her. \u201cWho are we speaking with?\u201d\n        The planchette quickly moved letter to letter. G-R-A-N-D-M-A.\n        \u201cOh my gosh! But my grandma\u2019s alive in Cincinnati.\u201d Mackenzie said.\n        Lilith gently touched her hand. \u201cI'm so sorry you had to find out this way, doll.\u201d \n        Jersey cleared his throat. \u201cShould Mackenzie move in with Lilith and Jersey, I mean Jermaine, and pay half the rent.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s enough weirdos! Come on Mac.\u201d Joey stood up and pulled Mackenzie by the arm and marched out the door.\n        Lilith sighed, \u201cYou always come on too strong.\u201d \n        Jersey snatched the entire bowl of cocktail weenies and plopped down on the couch next to Lilith. \n        \u201cTwo-time Staten Island hot dog eating champion. Isn\u2019t that something,\u201d Jersey said as he stabbed the tiny franks with a toothpick and devoured them. \u201cWanna watch Real Housewives of New Jersey?\u201d\n        Lilith gave a defeated nod.\n        He clicked on the TV. The housewives screamed at each other over pastries and wine. Jersey chuckled. \u201cThat Teresa. What a mess. You should really text her back sometime.\u201d\n        \u201cYup,\u201d Lilith agreed.

Those handfuls of seconds of searing pain made Petra dread mornings.\n\tPetra wished she could communicate with her nurse and tell her how much she abhorred those dang curtains.  When was the last time she was able to communicate anything? \n\tPetra imagined her head shaking. Her eyes darted around the room. Where had they moved the calendar? If she could tilt her head, even just a little, she\u2019d be able to really take in the room. \n\tIt was hard to judge time when you couldn't move. When your world was reduced to a hospital bed in a room you had no control over, each and every day melted into the next.

Tubes for feeding, for medicine, for urination, and the various drainage tubes. At this point, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tubes were protruding from her head. \n\tSqueaking shoes entered the room. It reminded Petra of her grandmother\u2019s pair of rocking chairs.

Instead, it left a longing for something sweet, savory, or any taste or sensation from eating. \n\tNurse Jenkins changed Perta\u2019s IVs, cleaned her up, and changed her clothes. \n\t\u201cAlright, now that you are all clean and ready for the day, let\u2019s eat, shall we,\u201d Nurse Jenkins nodded to Petra. \u201cGreat. The doctors will be in soon. Let\u2019s hope for the best. Okay,\u201d Nurse Jenkins smiled as she connected Petra\u2019s food. \n\tPetra stared up, hoping that Nurse Jenkins would recognize something in her eyes. But the nurse kept with her routine. \n\tPetra could feel the emptiness in her stomach being eased. If she could, she would have smiled; at least her hunger was no longer on the list of things to be concerned about. Sadness welled up in Petra. The pain, lack of communication, and general concern with her current state.\n\tA thin liquid coated Petra\u2019s lips. Was one of her bags leaking? Petra\u2019s eyes darted up. No. Everything seemed normal. Nurse Jenkins was reviewing Petra's various monitors and taking notes. Strangely, the coating seeped into Petra\u2019s mouth. Salty, it was salty. Was she crying? Petra had tried those first days, but nothing happened. The nurses had to resort to using eye drops on her. \n\t\u201cAlrighty, dear\u201d Nurse Jenkins gasped.  \u201cYou are crying, are you okay? Can you move anything or just blink?\u201d\n\tPetra summoned all her strength. She could feel her tears flowing. And just as naturally as breathing, her eyes blinked. Then she tilted her head. She parted her lips. A lightness overtook Perta. Even just these slight movements made her feel like she could fly.\n"}

","targets":"        Duncan heard the ringing in his ears soften to a dull hum. His eyes blinked open. Slowly, his vision returned to normal. He could make out the shapes of two figures talking in hushed tones. Duncan tried to speak, but only a muffled groan escaped his lips. The figures stopped talking and turned to Duncan.\n        \u201cGood, you\u2019re awake,\u201d said the taller figure in a lifeless voice. \u201cEveryone has been really worried about you.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat happened,\u201d Duncan asked. Only, the words, \u201cWhat happened,\u201d did not come out of Duncan\u2019s mouth. All he could produce was a slurred mess of sounds.\n        The tall figure replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about talking too much today. Only an hour left in the work day anyway. No need for a voice here.\u201d And with that, the figure strode away.\n        Duncan propped himself on his elbow, trying to gather himself to his feet. The shorter figure approached him cautiously. \n        \u201cYou don\u2019t know where you are, do you?\u201d Duncan shook his head as the shorter figure continued, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know how you got here.\u201d Again, Duncan shook his head. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even know who you are, do you?\u201d Duncan could not move. This was the truth.\n        The shorter figure smiled a big smile and crouched down. It leaned into Duncan\u2019s face, breathing hot, vile breath on his skin. Duncan waited, scared and wholly unsure how to react. After a pregnant pause, the figure opened its mouth as if it were about to say something. \n        \u201cLet him be.\u201d The taller figure had returned. \n        It whisked away the shorter figure with a firm grasp on the collar and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need any help. You remember your first day. First day awake, that is. Not a pleasant one, was it?\u201d\n        Just before they disappeared around the corner, Duncan noticed the shorter one drop something small and shiny on the carpeted floor. Then, behind the taller figure\u2019s back, the shorter figure put a finger to its lips and winked secretly to Duncan.\n        Once they had left, Duncan hurriedly crawled over to the object on the carpet. It was an oddly shaped, triangular key with strange etchings. Duncan ran his fingers over the foreign object, marveling at it. \n        \u201cBack to work! One hour left today! You think you get the day off? Think again!\u201d The tall figure had returned again, and grabbed at Duncan\u2019s collar. Still regaining his strength, Duncan allowed himself to be carried like a puppy in its mother\u2019s jaw. He slipped the key-like object into his pocket without the figure noticing.\n        The tall figure set Duncan at a workstation, not unlike a cubicle, littered with strange metal contraptions and devices, all of which had no meaning to Duncan. The moment he sat down at the station, his hands sprang to work, assembling and tinkering with the pieces. They seemed to move with their own mind, fulfilling tasks of which Duncan had no knowledge. \n        He looked around at others doing the same. His coworkers all looked content with their work. As he looked from workstation to workstation, his hands continued building or repairing whatever it was they were working on. \n        On the wall was a clock that did not tell time in the normal sense of the word. Instead, it acted as a countdown, marking the time remaining in the work day. By then, mere minutes remained.\n        When the clock reached zero, everyone, including Duncan, free of his own will, stopped what they were working on at the exact same time. Everyone headed towards a pair of large doors at the opposite end of the room labeled \u201cEXIT.\u201d\n        Duncan followed. He nudged a woman next to him. With some difficulty and slurring, he managed to say, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d \n        The woman ignored him entirely, focused only on the door. \n        As they got closer to the exit, a dull ringing sound grew louder.Even as the sound grew ear-splitting, nobody around him seemed to notice it. \n        Closer still, he shuffled forward. Louder still, the ringing grew.\n        Duncan plugged his ears with his fingers and managed to muffle the ringing.  A heartbeat later, the shorter figure from earlier pulled Duncan\u2019s hands from his ears.\n        \u201cWhat are you, mad? They\u2019ll punish you for that!\u201d The short one looked around nervously then urged Duncan forward. \u201cJust follow everyone else.\u201d \n        Once Duncan was right underneath the exit sign, the ringing became unbearable. The woman next to him stepped through the doorway and her eyes rolled back into her head. She collapsed on the floor next to another unconscious body.\n        Duncan realized now that the room beyond the exit doors was not the outside world as he had assumed it to be, but rather it was a painfully bright white room covered in cushions top to bottom. Everyone who had exited through the door had fallen asleep upon entering the room. \n        Panic struck Duncan. He turned around, trying to push against the flow of workers headed toward the exit. \n        The short figure called out to him, \u201cJust follow everyone else! You\u2019ll end up\u2013\u201d\n        His warning was cut short as he stepped beneath the exit sign and fell asleep. Duncan wasted no time pushing his way against the crowd. \n        \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d The tall figure had spotted Duncan trying to escape. \u201cNot on my watch, you don\u2019t.\u201d It grabbed Duncan\u2019s collar and dragged him to the exit sign.\n        \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Duncan called out desperately. The ringing climbed to a crescendo. Duncan thought his head might explode. And then suddenly, nothing. Blackness. Silence. Emptiness.\n        Slowly, eventually, out of the darkness came a light. That same bright white light that blinded Duncan earlier. He found himself seated at the workstation where he had been previously.  Same as before, his hands worked on machines he had no knowledge of. It was all still a mystery to him, but one thing was clearer now. He had to escape this place.\n        All day, Duncan kept his eyes trained on the countdown clock. He plotted and schemed while his hands worked involuntarily. Every half hour or so, Duncan would make eye contact with the short figure who worked at their own station. Then, he would remember the key the figure had given him. Duncan felt the weight of it in his pocket.\n        Besides the exit door, which Duncan knew was not actually an exit, there was only one other door. That door had not been opened or closed all day. In front of it stood the tall figure. \n        \u201cThat has to be the real exit,\u201d Duncan thought. With a plan hatched and the countdown clock nearing zero, his time to act was then or never. \n        Careful not to attract attention, Duncan removed his shoe. He began to pull tufts of carpet loose with his toes. He piled them neatly and slid his shoe back on.\n        The clock struck zero and in unison, everyone stopped work. They filed toward the exit door and the siren song of tinnitus began to ring again. Duncan followed along, compliant. He stepped beneath the exit sign and crumpled to the floor along with everyone else. \n        Once the room was full of sleeping workers, the ringing stopped. Duncan\u2019s eyes opened a sliver. He scanned the room. Only he was awake. He removed the bits of carpet he had stuffed in his ears.\n        Quietly he got to his feet and crept across the room, past his work station and over to the other door. He reached for the handle.\n        A voice pierced the air, \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d\n        Duncan knew the tall figure was behind him, reaching for his collar to yank him back to this living nightmare. He could not allow that. \n        As coolly and as clearly as he could form the words, he responded as he slid the key into the handle and turned it, \u201cI\u2019m going home for the day.\u201d\n        He stepped through the door and slammed it behind him. He breathed a sigh of relief and thought to himself, \u201cfree at last.\u201d That was all before he took in his new surroundings. \n        To Duncan's disbelief, he stood in an identical replica of the room he had just exited, full of busy workers. It was an exact mirror image, including the taller figure, the shorter figure and even another Duncan working tirelessly at his station. He knew then that there was no escape from this place.\n\n"}

She\u2019s tiny, so it wasn\u2019t that difficult. Ingrid\u2019s the one who actually hung Jenna\u2019s bra on the fire alarm, and therefore, I did not personally set off the alarm for an entire five-story dormitory. Technically, that was Ingrid and not me. Technically.\n        How was I supposed to know that me cracking up and making Ingrid lose her balance for a second would cause her to grab onto the alarm, and grabbing onto it would somehow make the alarm go off? How was I supposed to know we\u2019d send roughly a hundred girls spilling out onto the lawn of Radclyffe Hall at 6:30 a.m. on a Tuesday? We just thought it would be hilarious for Jenna to come out of the bathroom looking for her bra and find it hanging around the red alarm bell that\u2019s mounted just outside the bathroom on our third-floor hallway. Bra pranks are standard at a boarding school. It happens to all of us eventually.\n        Jenna got mad at us for stealing her bra while she was in the shower. She came out of the bathroom in a towel and spotted us, Ingrid standing on my shoulders, bra in hands. She looked so indignant. That\u2019s why I laughed, which is why I jostled Ingrid, and that\u2019s when she grabbed onto the alarm to steady herself, at which point it started blaring. Jenna saw the whole thing. Ingrid got the bra hung up anyway, while Jenna stood there sputtering, anger flashing in her eyes. I let Ingrid down as fast as I could, and just as I did, the others started streaming out of their rooms and the bathroom wearing pajamas and towels, muttering about \u201cA fire drill?\u201d and \u201c6:30! What the hell?\u201d Some looked barely awake. Despite the November chill, there wasn\u2019t a jacket in sight. \n        Ingrid and I, also still in our pajamas, did our best to blend in with the group as we hurried down the stairs, keeping with our dorm\u2019s fire drill protocol. Radclyffe Hall was old and weird and probably a gigantic firetrap, so they made us do fire drills once a month. Everyone knew the deal: Take the stairs and find your hall mates and Peer Rep for your floor and wing. Then, let the PR do a headcount to report to the Head Resident, Sondra. She\u2019s twenty-two and single. And yet, with her attitude, you\u2019d think she was a forty-five year-old jaded divorcee. The chilly air hit us when we exited the heavy double doors at the bottom of the stairs. \n        Ingrid looked at me, eyes wide, as we took in the scene of congregated girls and the flashing lights and sirens of a fire crew pulling up to the front entrance of Radclyffe.\n        \u201cWe are gonna be in so much trouble.\u201d\n        I shushed her. \u201cJust play it cool, okay? Nobody knows it was us.\u201d\n        Ingrid gulped. \u201cYeah, except Jenna. But she won\u2019t tell, right?\u201d\n        I flashed back to the anger in Jenna\u2019s eyes, but I tried to stay positive. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll think this is funny once we\u2019re all back inside and warm again. It was just a silly prank. She has a sense of humor.\u201d\n\n        In the chapel two hours later, Sondra made a special report during the announcement period. \u201c...and I\u2019d just like to remind you all that intentionally setting off a fire alarm is a federal offense. When we find out who did this - and we will - you will face disciplinary action.\u201d Jenna, who sat in the pew in front of ours, punctuated Sondra\u2019s grave announcement with a death glare at both of us. I shrugged and tried to look innocent, but I felt the blood rise in my face.\n        I turned to Ingrid when Jenna faced the front of the sanctuary again and whispered as quietly as my vocal cords would allow. \n        \u201cI think we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n        Another two hours, and Ingrid and I found ourselves in the office of Mother Catherine, Headmistress of St. Margaret\u2019s School for Girls. The inquisition lasted all of five minutes. Jenna had indeed ratted us out.\n        \u201cJust tell me this, girls, what possessed you to hang a bra from a fire alarm?\u201d\n        I shrugged and gave my best innocent face for the second time that morning. \u201cWe thought it would be funny.\u201d\n        Mother Catherine scoffed. \u201cOh really? Funny to make all your classmates go outside at six thirty in the morning on a cool, fall day? Some of them didn\u2019t even have shoes on. Taxpayers have to pay for the fire department to show up, whether they find a fire to put out or not.\u201d\n        Ingrid was crying now. I wanted to kick her under the head mistress\u2019s conference table, but then she probably would\u2019ve cried harder. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it. Celeste made me do it.\u201d She pointed at me.\n        \u201cWait a minute. Don\u2019t pin this on me. It was your idea. All I did was hold you up and\u2026\u201d My voice had started to rise in pitch. \u201cYou can\u2019t throw me under the bus like that!\u201d\n        Mother Catherine intervened. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care if you both levitated by magic. The fact is, this is a major infraction, and you were both involved, and there are consequences to face.\u201d\n        Saturday detention. For a month. Just for hanging a bra on a fire alarm.\n        Seriously. No phone, no electronic devices, no nothing. Just cleaning out the basement and organizing stuff people had donated for the annual school auction and rummage sale. For a month. On the one day of the week when we can actually go into town and get away from this hellhole.\n        \n        The first Saturday went by pretty quickly. We had a few hundred books to organize. People love giving away books. We gathered them all, shelved them, and then organized them by genre, author, and title. Ingrid worked in the school library during study hall, so she knew how to do it right. This took us pretty much the whole time, other than the fifteen minutes we spent sweeping the book room and cleaning the shelves.\n        The second Saturday began to drag. We finished the books and Sister Christine, who always heads up the auction and rummage sale, had us on knick-knacks - ceramic bird figurines, old clocks, commemorative plates featuring long-dead presidents, an ornate nativity scene with twenty dusty pieces, a black-tarnished silver vanity set, and all kinds of other things. Most of them were dirty and ancient and took forever to clean them properly. \n        Sister went back up to her room to take a nap after lunch. I had half a mind to just bail after we finished polishing a whole set of silverware that was actually made of silver. It was in an inlaid wood case and would definitely go for a good price in the auction. Ingrid, who convinced me not to leave, was getting some boxes from under a table in the side room full of donated clothes.\n        \u201cHey, what\u2019s this weird door? I found it when I moved the clothes.\u201d\n        A small, heavy-looking, half-sized door, half-hidden behind an old podium that stood beside the table, was locked with an antique padlock. \u201cLet\u2019s move this thing.\u201d I gestured to the podium. It made a hideous sound on the old poured-concrete basement floor as we half-walked, half-scooted the thing away from the door. Someone had painted over the hinges with the same paint used on the basement walls, several times over from the looks of the buildup, and there were a few chips in the paint that revealed the yellow and beige that must have been on the walls before the current pale green.\n        \u201cI saw a box of random old keys in the workshop. Want me to go get it?\u201d I liked Ingrid\u2019s thinking. If you discover a secret door, you have to find out what\u2019s on the other side. That\u2019s just the rules.\n        A bunch of the keys were old house keys and skeleton keys, some modern keys, and lots of darkened antique brass keys, a few small enough to potentially fit the padlock on the door. Of the eleven candidates, the eighth key finally popped the stubborn old lock.\n        I looked at Ingrid. She nodded. I took the lock off its hasp and pulled the handle. The sound of cracking paint filled the room as I pulled and pulled. Finally, the door came open, and we saw\u2026 well, not much, actually. It was dark and appeared to be a passage of some sort. The floor of the tunnel was cobblestone. The place smelled damp and musty, like my grandma\u2019s basement.\n        But just then, we heard Sister Christine coming down the stairs, so we closed the door and moved the boxes and the podium back into place with a speed and silence that astonished me. \u201cGirls, what was that noise?\u201d She had heard me wrench the door open and probably the subsequent scurry of cover-up activity.\n        \u201cNothing, Sister! We were just moving some boxes.\u201d I gestured towards the bins under the table. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n        She yawned and looked at the clock on the far wall. \u201cI guess you two can be done for today, it\u2019s 3:45 now anyway. I don\u2019t suppose fifteen minutes less detention will ruin you.\u201d\n        Ingrid and I looked at each other, nodded to the Sister, and dashed around her and up the stairs towards freedom.\n        The third week, I smuggled a mini flashlight in my pocket. Ingrid and I made a big show of cleaning the workshop, organizing the tools, and sweeping the floors. Then Sister Christine set us to sorting the clothes we had supposedly begun the week before. She left us as we moved the boxes into the middle of the room and opened them to start piles for the auction (costume pieces, jewelry, ornate old hats), rummage sale (everything else), and unsellable items with stains or holes. After she disappeared, we finished the sorting in record time, and then Ingrid and I moved the podium, very carefully this time to avoid any incriminating racket.\n        I aimed my tiny flashlight into the tunnel and crawled in. Clearance in the passage was short, but I\u2019m a little below average height. Ingrid is even shorter, so we were able to stand, barely, once we had crawled past the door. The passage had tree roots growing into one side about ten yards in, and some mud had seeped in through the cracks. The ceiling appeared to be the floor of another part of the school building, and it didn\u2019t seem to be in grave danger of caving in.\n        All told, the tunnel extended for about twenty yards and ended at another door of about the same size. Faint light seeped in through the crack at the bottom of the door, where it met the stone floor.\n        \u201cWhat do you think is in there?\u201d Ingrid looked frightened in the weak flashlight glow. \u201cWanna try the door?\u201d\n        \u201cSure, why not?\u201d My pulse raced as I pushed on the small door. It gave about an inch, then bumped up against an obstacle. I pushed harder, but whatever blocked the door wouldn\u2019t budge. Without any discussion, Ingrid and I braced ourselves against the opposite wall of the passage - about three feet wide in total - then used our legs to kick and push the door wide enough for one of us to look through it.\n        As the smaller of the two of us, Ingrid volunteered to squeeze through and take a look. Instead, she fully disappeared through the small opening, and next, I heard a scraping sound as she dragged whatever object blocked the door a few more inches. \u201cI think you can get through now.\u201d It was an old metal toolbox, heavy with a load of rusty mechanic\u2019s tools.\n        I squeezed through the small opening, flashlight first. I hadn\u2019t seen this place before. It had a small, one-panel garage type door with a pull handle, the glass translucent and old, an amber color. They\u2019d been painted over long ago, but much of the color had peeled and chipped to the extent that it let in a decent amount of mid-afternoon light. My flashlight picked up the slack.\n        \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d A few rusty old coffee and tobacco cans stood at irregular intervals on some shelving that lined a cinder block wall. A partially windowed door with several layers of peeling paint and lifted wood veneer stood next to the pull-handle garage door, again with light streaming in around the cracked and peeling paint.\n        \u201cProbably just an old tool shed. Let\u2019s sneak out!\u201d\n        Ingrid, ever the party pooper. \u201cWhat if we get caught?\u201d\n        \u201cUm, we\u2019re already caught. What can they do?\u201d I laughed, already trying the door to the outside. It stuck a bit, but it opened when I kicked it.\n        Finally, some fresh air! I stepped outside and breathed it in. Sweet freedom!\n        I looked behind me to see if Ingrid had joined me, but when I turned around, all I saw was a black sleeve with a hand grabbing her by the shoulder, pulling her back into the room. Sister Christine. We were well and truly busted. Clearly a sting operation.\n        I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s when I made a break for it. I ran for the trees at the edge of the school property, knowing I\u2019d get caught, not caring. For that moment, I had just pulled off the greatest heist in history. I was on the lam. I was free, laughing at the absurd sight of Sister Christine chasing after me, her black nun\u2019s habit billowing behind her in the wind.\n"}

Our spy loft was completely finished. It took forever. First, there was the climb to the top of the tree. It was a very precarious journey.  Fraught with many injuries and setbacks. There was an incident, that of the great-broken branch.  We survived the fall. However, hiding the massive branch we broke from the tree proved more difficult than we anticipated. We could not let that be seen, or people might have discovered our location. \n        We knew this was going to be the most brilliant summer ever for us cousins. We had spent our summers together every year for the past eight years. I had just turned nine, and we were only a few months apart in age, so we are almost like sisters. As soon as that final school bell rang, we knew that we would soon be reunited at grandmother\u2019s house for our summer adventures. This year was the year we made a spy loft in a tree. What a tale to tell. \n        The branch was heavy and longer than both of us put together. Our first attempt to hide it was behind a pine tree. Alas, the branch was so big you could see the ends sticking out on either side like massive antlers on a deer. \n        Eventually, because we were on a mission and the clock was ticking, we decided to hide the branch in the tree where our loft would be built. I climbed up first. My partner in crime pushed the branch up toward me. I held it, and she climbed above me. I pushed it toward her. It was heavy, but we persevered. \n        We repeated this very slow and difficult process until we decided that we were high enough that the branch would not be noticeable from the ground. We wove it into other branches to secure it. Then we continued on.\n        Finding the perfect spot for a spy loft is harder than one might think, especially in a tree.  Most importantly, as we discovered, the branches had to be thick enough to hold our combined weight. It turns out that we were horrible judges of this one very important requirement. I\u2019m surprised we survived in more or less one piece. More on this to follow. \n        For the moment, we were happy. We were on an important mission, and eventually found the perfect spot for our loft. It was everything we could have hoped for. We could stand on a branch and look out over the top of the tree. It was possible to survey all the mission required areas. As they say, location, location, location. We took smaller branches to make a little floor between the larger branches. We were invisible to those walking beneath us. Stealth was mission-critical.\n        Then it happened, our first target of the day. We could not believe our eyes. Oh, the excitement! We were going to hear everything the adults said. Not just any adults \u2014 our uncle and grandfather. \n        We giggled with glee. We could hardly believe our luck. Not only that, but we felt so clever, so smart. And they were smoking! Grandmother would be so upset. This information was just the type we needed to drop on my uncle to get the good candy. Oh, the information! The thought of future candy! \n        They went into the house, and we waited for the next round. Who would be next? We could hardly wait to find out. Summer is so exciting, my cousin and I spend most of it here at grandmother\u2019s house, and the entire family came at various points for visits. It was the perfect time for our spy missions.\n        My cousin went down a few branches to make sure my grandmother was still at the kitchen table. We could see her through the window from the tree. If she moved, we would have to make a hasty retreat back to our bedroom window. It was important to keep track of her location, or the mission would be a bust. \n        We had the layout of the land. This was a classic 1970s ranch house with a basement. It was perfect for keeping track of everything that happened on the first floor, which was our main concern. Our room was on the first floor, and we could make that small climb up through the window very quickly if we worked together. We knew the drill; climb back inside the window, shut it, and pull the covers over ourselves before she could make it down the hallway to our door. The time was tight on this maneuver, but we were confident in our abilities. \n        We relaxed into the tree branches, talking to each other about our hopes and dreams, and what type of candy we think our information would be worth. We were happy. Very happy. The breeze was lovely, and we were not in our room napping. It was the perfect summer afternoon for us. \n        Into this delightful summer reverie came an ominous CRACK!  Suddenly, we were falling! FALLING!! The two of us somehow managed to grab branches on the way down. We were just hanging. Our feet could not reach anything and neither of us could catch our breath. \n        \u201cWell, isn\u2019t this just an unmitigated disaster,\u201d I said to myself. Then, to my cousin,  \u201cOh. My. God! We are going to die!\u201d\n        \u201cNo, we are alive, at least for now,\u201d she replies.\n        \u201cWe are going to be in so much trouble, what should we do?\u201d I say.\n        I asked the question, but had no answer. Neither of us did. I was really starting to freak out. I was trying to determine if dying was better than facing my grandmother after sneaking out the window during our nap. Grandmother still seemed like a fate worse than death. \n        I could feel the panic intensifying. My cousin was the brave one. I was usually the voice of reason. However, neither of us had any great ideas at the moment.  We were dangling from a tree branch, and our hands were starting to get sore.\n        \u201cWe could call for help,\u201d my cousin suggested.\n        \u201cNo, we will be in soooooooooo much trouble. We have to figure out how to get down and back to our room before anyone finds out we are missing,\u201d I insisted.\n        \u201cI still think we should call for help, maybe uncle is in the garage, and he can save us,\u201d my cousin hissed.\n        \u201cThat is the worst idea ever! Remember when we got stuck on the roof, and he had to rescue us? There is a reason why we are grounded and supposed to be napping,\u201d I whisper-yelled back to her. \n        I was surprised that my cousin, of all people, wanted to call for help. The brave one who never retreats.  In the end, we agreed that the worst thing we could do was call for help. Death was preferable to our grandmother\u2019s wrath. \n        There were many reasons for this. It boiled down to two important facts that I explained to my cousin. First, we are grounded, so being rescued is not going to help our cause. Second, if we get caught, then the adults will know that we have been sneaking out of the window, and thus end the future possibilities of this freedom we presently enjoy. Even if it condemns us to almost certain death, we are on our own. \n        Let\u2019s be honest. This was not the first time we have left our room. It was our thing. We were told to go to our room and play quietly or nap. We were quiet, at least from the perspective of the adults. The quiet was actually more due to our absence, but they don't know that. Ignorance was bliss for all concerned. \n        When not condemned to a nap, we set up elaborate doll play scenes so that when we came back in, the dolls were our alibi. Look at us girls playing dolls together. (Pay no attention to the fact that a screen is missing from the window!) The downside was, neither of us liked to play with dolls, but we got them as gifts because they thought we did. \n        But, I digress. We were still hanging from the tree. If we got caught, our freedom was in peril. Things were looking bleak. Very. Bleak.\n         As an added bonus, I really believed that we were going to die. I would like to say that I regretted my actions during these perilous moments. However, that simply was not the case. I was really just worried about our dog Max. Who was going to sneak him food under the table at meals? Who was going to let him sleep in bed even though he was not allowed on the furniture? Poor Max.  \n        Motivated by the idea of a Max deprived of treats for all perpetuity, I was determined to solve our problem. As I dangled there, I thought to myself, \u201cthis must be what gymnasts feel like before they start swinging to get to the next set of bars.\u201d  \n        Bingo! I knew what must be done. Our way out of the disaster, or should I say, our way down, is clear to me. It is not the safest idea, but it could work.\n        I looked over to my cousin and said, \u201cHey, we should start swinging and then try to get to a lower branch like they do in gymnastics.\u201d \n        My cousin, being the brave one, did not even for a second, not a second, question this dubious method of getting out of the tree. In fact, she was actually excited by the prospect and went first. \n        She made it! \n        Of course, she did. She was truly gifted at this sort of feat. However, the same cannot be said about me. It was my turn, and unlike my cousin, I was terrified. Only the thought of Max sleeping on the floor motivated my leap of faith.\n        Down I go! \n        The relief I felt when I had a secure grip on the new branch was like passing my last grade school exam in mathematics.  \n        So, the two of us were once again hanging side by side, just waiting for our swinging to stop. Since our first leap was successful, we decided to carry on until we could reach a branch with our feet and climb down. \n        Lucky for us, it worked. We made it down, and back to the safety of our room. We never enjoyed hopping under the covers more than on this day. For once, when my grandmother checked on us, we were actually sleeping. \n"}

The story should end with the protagonist being freed by clever means, and should be between 2050 and 2150 words.","targets":"        When I was first imprisoned in the bottle, four thousand years ago, he who created my prison allowed me to use magic mirrors to see the outside. I doubt that in his wildest dreams he ever imagined I would learn how to manipulate those mirrors and to see much further. Likely, he believed my limitations would drive me to yearn for release and long to serve someone with my magic. I used them to learn about the world around me.\n        My prison always alerted me when a possible owner came near. Most mortals could not perceive my bottle, being unable to conceive of anything outside their own sadly limited world. Others could see the bottle, but they would see only something made of carnival glass. Only a very few had the potential to see more, and even then picking up my prison wasn\u2019t enough. To free me, they would have to rub the bottle. \n        The newest potential owner came into the thrift store where my bottle sat with other glass decor, placed by a man who volunteered out of the goodness of his heart. I had hoped he might see the bottle for what it was, yet it was not to be; his partner and his collection of stuffed animals were the only magic he\u2019d ever needed in his life.\n        But then a woman picked up my bottle as if drawn to it, even under the harsh fluorescent lights of the chain thrift store. From reading the small rectangle of her identification as she presented it to the cashier, I learned her name was Lydia. It was likely something in her yearned for a more magical life. \n        The car ride was instructive. She muttered about \u201cwasting money when rent was due\u201d and lamenting that she\u2019d have to buy ramen for the next week. Not once did she direct resentment at the bottle in the bag in her passenger seat, held in place by the seat belt, blue-green and swirled like an ocean entwined with kelp. She took great care bringing my prison into her apartment, nestled in bubble wrap and tissue. \n        My prison is indestructible by mortal hands, but her care was a balm to my existence.\n        The bottle was given pride of place on the coffee table in the middle of the room, and Lydia put other purchases away before sitting in her computer chair and staring at my prison for a long moment.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but\u2026.\u201d she trailed off as she gently stroked the bottle, the act being sufficiently similar to rubbing it to set me free.\n        \u201cGreetings. I am named Alatriamedenaltavis, but you may call me Tria, owner.\u201d Four thousand years, and I was at least allowed by my prison to give my owner a nickname.\n        She recoiled and pulled her knees to her chest. I had taken human shape, close enough to my own: a curvy woman of middling stature with sea-green hair. Perhaps it was the shock of me appearing in her living room from nowhere? I had dressed appropriately for the time period, in a skirt and blouse that she might have worn herself, which I expected would put her more at ease. Perhaps, she was uncomfortable with my use of the term \u201cowner,\u201d but by the terms of my imprisonment, I could not refer to the person who released me as anything else unless they told me otherwise.\n        After several moments of her hyperventilating, she managed to uncurl and slow her breathing. \u201cUm. I guess you\u2019re a genie or something? Just call me Lydia.\u201d\n        \u201cAs you ask, so shall I do. And while we do not call ourselves genies, it will serve to describe me. I am bound to serve you and grant you three wishes.\u201d\n        She spent the next several minutes swearing; I appreciated her use of invective, and even memorized some terms for later use. Interspersed with this, however, was a frustrated rant about how she couldn\u2019t even keep a plant alive, what was she supposed to do with a person who also happened to be a genie?\n        \u201cOkay. There have to be rules, right? What are they? Or do I have to wish for that information?\u201d As she stood then paced around the room, I studied her. Short brown hair, plain figure, glasses with chunky black frames, a gray sweatshirt declaring her fondness for chocolate by its chemical formula, simple black leggings, and sturdy black boots. \n        \u201cThere are indeed rules, and no, you do not have to wish for that. I am not allowed to affect the emotions of others without their consent. I cannot raise the dead. Parallel to that, I cannot undo the past. I cannot grant you more wishes.\u201d \n        I paused, testing the boundaries of my imprisonment. \u201cThere are certain things I can advise you not to do. An example from my history is that you should not wish for me to cause the deaths of others, no matter how justified you, or I may believe it to be.\u201d I struggled to say more, but could not tell her anything related to freeing me.\n        She shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you were put in that position. Hypothetically, what would happen if I did make that wish?\u201d\n        \u201cIn modern terms, it would be named the \u2018law of unintended consequences\u2019; even I cannot predict all the ripple effects of a death.\u201d \n        \u201cHunh.\u201d Lydia stared for a long moment at a picket sign propped on the wall, proclaiming her passion for human rights. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just leave you bound like that,\u201d she muttered, stalking around her living room.\n        I noted that she caught my use of the word \u2018bound\u2019, but then my binding compelled me to ask, \u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t like to have money? A more conventionally attractive form? Health and longevity?\u201d\n        She spun on me, glaring. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re stuck like this? I don\u2019t care what you did, nobody deserves that. Unless you actually did something and this is penance, and even then there are better ways than forced servitude.\u201d\n        \u201cAh, no, own \u2013 um, Lydia.\u201d I was startled enough to almost forget her instruction. \u201cThe magician who summoned me did so to make use of my magic, nothing more or less. He intended that once he was done with me, the bottle would find its way to others who could make use of it, and me.\u201d\n        Lydia stomped around some more, swearing about how some people gave humanity a bad name. Finally, she stopped and spun on me once more, narrowing her eyes.\n        \u201cI\u2019m going to start with saying that while I do kinda want to look better, that\u2019s not a wish I\u2019m going to make. And yeah, I do need money, but again, not going to wish for it.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cIt feels like exploiting you, and I\u2019m really not comfortable with that, no matter what I might want.\u201d\n        \u201cYour concern truly is for using me, and not the possible repercussions?\u201d\n        \u201cYeah. Even if you\u2019re nice and don\u2019t twist my words like in all the stories I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m guessing that me making wishes doesn\u2019t actually help or free you.\u201d\n        I looked down at my feet. In four thousand years, only two others had ever considered my situation. I couldn\u2019t tell her how to free me. The magician blocked that method of escape. But she could wish for me to tell her. I truly did want her to wish for that, even if I couldn\u2019t tell her that she could.\n        Meanwhile, she had gone to the bottle, my prison, and started looking it over. \u201cI guess this wasn\u2019t carnival glass after all. Hey, what\u2019s this thing on the bottom? Looks like a maker\u2019s mark or something.\u201d\n        I opened my mouth to speak, but no sound emerged. What a cruel binding by that magician! She\u2019d found a clue and I could not tell her. But she did notice.\n        \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me, can you? Bet you it has to do with you being bound.\u201d She rolled her eyes and swore a bit more before saying clearly, \u201cI wish that you could and would tell me how to free you, the methods and means, and all the consequences.\u201d\n        Something loosened in my bindings, and I quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t wish for my freedom, you\u2019ll take my place and live a mortal lifespan inside that bottle. The magician also said that making an impossible wish would break the bottle and free me, but he never intended that to be possible. Finally, there is a key for my prison. It is in the form of a signet ring, and it fits the mark you noted, but it must be the specific key he created and not a copy. That is the only safe way to release me.\u201d\n        Lydia nodded. \u201cHe probably never thought of 3D printing, but yeah, there\u2019s probably magic involved in the key.\u201d She wandered around muttering some more, cradling the bottle like a precious thing, then asked, \u201cWith that first wish, does that include you telling me where the key is?\u201d\n        I blinked. \u201cI\u2026 yes. I am allowed to tell you the key is buried beneath the foundations of the magician\u2019s home, which is located near the border of the countries called Yemen and Oman in the present day. It is now a desert, which explains why it is undisturbed.\u201d\n        \u201cMeaning, I can\u2019t just go there myself. Am I permitted to ask you to retrieve it for me?\u201d\n        \u201cI cannot touch the key myself,\u201d I started sadly, only for her to roll her eyes again.\n        \u201cBecause why would it be that easy,\u201d Lydia muttered as she stomped off to another room (my magic told me it was her bedroom) and came back with a jar. \u201cLook. If I have to wish for you to retrieve the key, I\u2019ll do it, but unless the thing is idiotically big, it\u2019ll probably fit in the jar. You go there, maneuver the jar around the key, close it off, and bring it back. Voil\u00e0, you didn\u2019t touch the key at all.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 brilliant. Give me the jar. I can count the retrieval as a part of the first wish easily enough.\u201d\n        And truly, it took moments, most of those spent ensuring that the magician\u2019s signet ring never made contact with me as I encapsulated it in the jar. Were I mortal, I would have been breathing far too quickly. My imprisonment was nearing its end.\n        On my return, Lydia smiled at me. \u201cThank you. Let\u2019s see here, I\u2019m going to open this over a bowl. I don\u2019t want desert sand all over my apartment.\u201d She pulled the ring out of the mound of sand \u2013 a flat stone of the same color as my bottle, set into a heavy gold ring \u2013 and whistled. \u201cThis\u2019d be worth a fair bit, but first things first. How do I unlock your prison?\u201d\n        I was capable of hyperventilating, it seemed, this close to freedom. \u201cAlign the marks on the ring with the bottom of the bottle, and once the ring is set, turn it clockwise a full three turns. And for whatever it is worth, I promise I will do you no harm once I am freed.\u201d\n        She grinned as she retrieved the bottle. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda nice, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d turn me inside out. Okay, here goes. Wait, clockwise relative to me, or to the bottle?\u201d\n        \u201cCunning. Your wish tells me that if you hold the neck of the bottle, so the bottom faces you, the ring should turn clockwise relative to you.\u201d\n        \u201cGot it, and now to get you out of that prison.\u201d She looked at me for confirmation at each step, and on the third revolution the bottle clicked, the stopper evaporated into mist, and the chains of my imprisonment dissolved around me.\n        \u201cFreedom,\u201d I whispered, and Lydia \u2013 no longer my owner \u2013 put the bottle gently onto her table.\n        \u201cWhat now, Tria?\u201d She smiled, but I saw her sadness for what it was. The adventure was about to leave her life, only a sea-green bottle and ring of unknown provenance as her souvenirs.\n        Slowly, I answered, \u201cI need, no, I want a guide to this time and place. And if you are interested, I would like for it to be you.\u201d\n        The woman who freed me blinked a bit. \u201cReally?\u201d She paused, and the grin came back to her face. \u201cYeah, I can do that. Just gotta figure out practicalities, but yeah.\u201d\n        I waved my hands, magic flowing, and the apartment gained another bedroom. \u201cMagic triumphs over boring practicality, new roommate.\u201d\n        Lydia laughed. \u201cLiving with you, Tria, that\u2019s going to be an adventure.\u201d\n"}

If only I could scream for help, but that wouldn\u2019t work when the only thing that works properly are my eyes. Even when I blink profusely, no one manages to take it seriously. \n        Every day is the same struggle, I try to move but nothing happens. Like clockwork, someone comes in to check if I\u2019m still mentally here, once again I try to find a way to communicate but to no avail. Supposedly, I have been here for over two years, trapped in this body and mind. No one knows what happened, I was just dropped off in front of the hospital and that was the end of it. \n        I closed my eyes after another failed attempt to move any part of my body. My mind floated back and forth between the constant nightmare of being able to move again, back to being motionless at the drop of a dime. This time was different, an unsettling feeling came over me, a dark figure appeared in my dream. \n        \u201cHello, Tracy, remember me? I bet you don't but let me remind you.\u201d The dark figure then revealed itself to be a werewolf.  \n        Memories of a dark night kept flashing before my eyes. I was running, but I didn\u2019t know where to or from what. Then the flashes stopped only to focus on the dark figure who was now a man. \n        My pupils dilated in fear as the dark figure continued speaking. \u201cYou do remember me, please don\u2019t be afraid of me. I guess you are wondering what happened. Well, let\u2019s just say we had a little accident. I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get to you, but I\u2019m here now.\u201d \n        Once again flashes of memories kept coming, this time when they stopped, I saw myself from the dark figure\u2019s point of view. To my surprise, there I was holding this dark figure\u2019s hand, laughing and smiling, until he revealed himself to be a werewolf. \n        \u201cTracy, I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen to you, I only wanted you to truly see me,\u201d he said with sadness. \n        I now remembered what happened, as I was running away, I fell and hit my head only to wake up in the hospital completely paralyzed. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you out of this state. I\u2019m not here to hurt you, but you have to trust me in this process. It\u2019s going to be a long one.\u201d  \n        I stood there, or rather, laid there trying to decide if I should trust him, then I thought about who he was, then it hit me, it was Marcus, a man I had been dating for only a year. \n        I woke up from the dream, vision, or whatever it was before I could ask Marcus how he planned to help me out of this. Over and over I tried to force myself back to sleep in hopes that he would reappear, but it was no luck, my mind was consumed to the point that sleep evaded me. \n        Sleep came again, and there he was, \u201cwelcome back, sleeping beauty.\u201d \n        \u201cMarcus, how do I get out of this state?\u201d I wasted no time in asking, for fear that I would wake up again without getting the chance to. \n        \u201cTracy, we have to explore your deepest mind in order to fix this. We have to find your will. It slipped away when you saw my true image.\u201d A sense of hope came to me only to be squashed by defeat when I thought of being able to accomplish such a feat. \n        \u201cTracy, take my hand, let\u2019s get started before you wake up. Know this, every time you wake up you will have to start back from the beginning. I won't be there, I can only be where you left off.\u201d Just the thought of having to start over again made me feel even more defeated, but I was determined to get back to my life. \n        The first thing we encountered were my memories, there we had to find the memory of walking for the very first time in my life. There we would rediscover the first instance of what my will can do. I had thought it would be right there at the front because it was the thing I desired the most, but being that it was so long ago, we had to dig deep down for it. \n        The backdrop was like a maze and at the end was that memory. As we progressed through the maze, I encountered every single memory that I wanted to bury until the end of time. These were not the most pleasant memories in my life, and they just kept getting worse the further we got. With each painful memory of my past, I wanted to just give up, but I had to keep in mind that the desire to find my will would be my guiding light.  \n        Finally, we reached the memory of walking for the very first time. Once I reached it, I awoke with tears streaked down my face from the encounter. I tried to move to see if this was even worth the trouble. Just as I was about to give up completely and accept my fate, to my surprise, a finger moved. This brought me joy, hope and determination to continue. I patiently waited for sleep to take me again, and once again I started at the beginning of the maze and met Marcus at the end.\n        I took Marcus\u2019s hand, we had to reach the next level of my mind where we had to find my deepest desire. It would amplify the desire to move again. Memories of my time with Marcus were at the forefront. After all, what I wanted most was just someone to love me. Marcus truly did, especially with him here now, helping me get out of this state. Even though his true image was frightening, his heart was the brightest thing ever. The backdrop for this layer of my mind was a gigantic jigsaw puzzle where all of the pieces were scattered everywhere.  \n        However, before completing the puzzle, I was awakened by a loud noise in my room. When I opened my eyes, to my surprise, my arm was throbbing and was not in its normal place. It had knocked over the tray that was sitting on the table next to my bed. Internally, I smiled because I knew moving was returning, then I waited for sleep to consume me once again. \n        Through the maze, I went and on to the jigsaw puzzle. This time to my surprise the puzzle was still in the same position, with all of the pieces still there that I had already put together. As I completed the puzzle, I looked over at Marcus, who was smiling at me. \n        I wanted to tell him how I truly felt, but I was afraid that if I did, he would disappear. Something in me told me that this was the final level, admitting my truest of desires, my love for Marcus. As I put the last piece on the jigsaw, I mustered up the courage to tell Marcus, but when I turned around, he was gone, and I had returned to reality again.\n        I looked up and attempted to move, this time I could move every part of my body, joy filled me and when I looked around the room I saw Marcus lying peacefully on the makeshift bed next to mine. I had never realized he was there all this time, maybe it was because I couldn\u2019t move, or maybe he just got there. It didn\u2019t really matter at all, I was so happy to be able to walk again, and that Marcus was there with me. I kneeled down next to Marcus\u2019s sleeping form and watched him as he finally rose to see me. \n        \u201cHello, sleeping beauty,\u201d I said to Marcus as he stretched. \n        \u201cWelcome back to the world of motion,\u201d he said jokingly. \n        Even then I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of him, now was my chance to admit my love for him before I was either swept back into the land of the motionless again or he disappeared.\n        \u201cI love you, Marcus, please don\u2019t disappear.\u201d I closed my eyes and slowly opened them again to see if everything was still the same. \n        Marcus was still there with a smile on his face as he said, \u201cI love you too, and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n"}

I started celebrating early in the day. Now it is nearly dusk, and I must admit that I have already drunk more than my fill. The festival is a fine time for great connoisseurs of Italian wines. It is also a fine time to find wealthy gentlemen with loose pocketbooks and quality vintages. Even the most miserly types are willing to share a glass of wine with an old acquaintance during the festival.\n        I see my friend Montresor across the piazza and attempt to flag him down. I have been meaning to call on him for weeks and am glad to see him again. Our last encounter ended awkwardly. We\u2019d supped together at Luchesi's villa, and I had a roaring evening. Luchesi is a most generous sort once the good drink is in him. I must admit that the end of the evening had washed into a blur. However, as I was tasting one of Luchesi\u2019s finest vintages, Montresor took offense to something I said. What was it? I couldn\u2019t clearly remember. Yes, the drink had been strong on my tongue that night. Had I made some joke at his expense? Not that I could recall. \n        I\u2019ve always felt a kinship with Montresor. Yes, he has a reputation for being humorless. However, his connoisseurship in wine nearly rivals my own and I\u2019ve heard tell of the riches of his wine vaults.\n        It is crucial that I stay in the favor of men like Montresor. So far, none of the gentry have yet to discover my ruse. Only I know that my father\u2019s fortunes are spent. The allowance my wretched brother now gives me to live on could never support a man with my taste for quality. I know very well that if I want to drink the ambrosia of a high quality vintage, it must be at the expense of my wealthy friends.\n        Montresor picks me out from the crowd. I am conspicuously decked in my festival attire, with my parti-striped suit. I shake my head, musically clanging the bells on the conical cap I wear on my head. It is easier to get a free round when dressed like a fool. \n        \u201cMy dear Fortunato, you are luckily met,\u201d says Montresor as he aggressively shakes my hand.\n        Before I can properly greet my friend, or clear the air after our last encounter, he is already bragging to me about purchasing a pipe of Amontillado. I can hardly believe my good fortune. Amontillado!\n        \u201cHow?\u201d I ask. \u201cAmontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\u201d\n        \u201cI have my doubts,\u201d Montresor replies. He admits that he foolishly paid the full price for the pipe without first consulting me on the quality of the wine.\n        My heart leaps. This is the exact opportunity that I have been waiting for. Amontillado. The most perfect sherry wine, darker than fino but lighter than oloroso. There is nothing in the world I love more. Montresor is on his way to visit with Luchesi, but with a musical shake of my head and a bit of goading, I convince him to allow me to taste the Amontillado. I take his arm, and he leads me to the wondrous bounty in his vaults.\n        Montresor\u2019s home is absolutely silent. All the servants must be out celebrating the festival. He hands me a torch and leads me into the catacombs beneath his home, where he keeps his better vintages. Descending the stairs, my old cough starts up. Montresor looks at me with concern in his eyes. \n        My loud coughing echoes tremendously in the narrow, dark hall of the Montresor family catacomb. Montresor puts a warm hand on my arm and says, \u201cCome, we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me, it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.\u201d\n\tI look at my friend warmly and tell him, \u201cI will not die of a cough.\u201d He smiles at me as he hands me a bottle of Medoc that he picks from the vault. We take great, joyful swigs together, toasting to one another\u2019s long life and health as we continue the journey deeper into the crypt.\n        Then there is another flask of another vintage. My head begins to feel heavy. I hear the conical bells from my cap ring out. My vision begins to blur, my words to tumble together.\n        When I wake to full consciousness, I am chained to a wall. Where am I? Where is my friend? Is this a dream? Often, I have awoken from nightmares, my body still sleeping, my mind horrifyingly awake. I cry out.\n        Then, I see Montresor\u2019s face over a short wall before me. What is he doing? I try to call out his name. My wine heavy tongue will not form the words.\n        Montresor sloshes something wet and heavy on the short wall and then places a brick on top. Then another. Then another.\n        I shake my head wildly. The merry bells clang harshly.\n        He puts another brick against the wall. I pull hard against the wall, but the chains do not move.\n        Montresor places another brick on the wall, then another.\n        I can feel madness coming over me. It is a joke. It is all a brutal joke. I pull against the chains.\n        Another brick.\n        \u201cAn excellent jest,\u201d I scream. \u201cWe will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo, over our wine!\u201d\n        Another brick. I am almost in pitch blackness. I can only see Montresor\u2019s hands as he demonically labors.\n        Another brick. \n        He throws the torch in through the last, open hole and places a final brick to seal out all other light.\n        Now, I watch the embers of the dying torch. Alone in the darkness, I yell out, \u201cI have done you no wrong, friend!\u201d \n        I must break free. I must! A terrible sobriety overcomes me.\n        I shake my whole body in one final effort.\n        I hear nothing. Nothing but the clavicle bells, ringing their sound of folly.\n"}

","targets":"        August 16, 1991: I awoke, as always, at 6 A.M. with a gasp. I sat up in bed and clutched my hand to my throat in a protective gesture. It had never gone for my throat, as it would not have been practical to kill me. But it certainly had choked me in the past, clutching the tense sinews of my neck with c-shaped palms and pressing in deep around my vocal chords with hard thumbs. This morning, I did not see its hulking presence immediately. But that made my fear all the more intense.\n        I carefully pulled back the duvet from my legs and tiptoed the ten feet to my bathroom. After relieving myself, I caught a glimpse of my face in the mirror. Sunken cheeks and dark circles under my eyes greeted me, and I did not linger in my self-gaze. I retreated to the kitchen, hoping to eat something before it emerged. There was never a question of \u201cif\u201d it would make an appearance, only a matter of \u201cwhen.\u201d \n        The thing was amorphous in form; always changing and always shifting in its size and its threats. Sometimes it flowed towards me in slow liquid motions, engulfing me like liquid mercury and just as poisonous. Then it would keep me physically bound to my bed for days on end. But at other times it was fast and sharp, slicing at me with its clawed nails quickly, with the pain only coming to me after it had left the room, when I glanced down and saw blood. In those instances, I feared the surprise and shock as much as the thing itself. \n        It struck as I was taking the last bite of a bagel and peanut butter at the kitchen table. Suddenly I was dragged by my left leg, screaming and kicking, across the linoleum floor of my apartment kitchen. The thing always appeared low to the ground, pulling me under like it was an ancient leviathan and I was a sailor lost at sea. My chin hit the door frame making me see stars. I gripped the edge of the frame as its blurry hands tugged me back towards the bathroom, digging my nails into the wood until they tore around the corners leaving raggedy bits of bleeding skin.\n        I awoke sore and breathing slowly hours later in the center of my bathroom floor. I had vomited but thankfully made it to the toilet this time. My body ached from tensing every muscle and I staggered back to my bed. The creature peered at me from inside of my closet, curled up comfortably in a pile of clothes that I had so carefully selected and ironed for my day of errands. But as always, my plans did not come to fruition, and I spent the remainder of the day motionless in bed. Periodically, the monster would crawl out of its hiding spot and take a swipe at my small body curled into a tiny circle at the center of my mattress, but mostly it stayed just in the periphery of my vision in the closet.\n        August 18, 1991: Today was the day. I would make my escape. I knew the time and the place to meet my rescuer. Atleast, I hoped he would be my rescuer.  I had sought refuge from my monster in the past with little to no success. Sometimes my respite would last a few hours. Once, in the late 1980s, I had a full two weeks of freedom before the monster found me again. But this time my rescuer said things would be different. \n        I woke up and instantly my monster was upon me. I clawed and bit back, fighting it as much as I could. It crushed me into my bed and I imagined every spring stabbing into my spine as the weight of the creature prevented me from taking a full breath. My stomach churned from its smell and waves of nausea kept me still as I prayed for the monster to leave me. Eventually, it grew tired and skulked away for a rest. \n        I got up, and slowly dressed. I trembled as I slipped on my shoes and walked backwards to my door, watching carefully for the creature to emerge. But it didn\u2019t emerge, and I was able to leave my apartment door, locking it with shaking hands behind me[4]. I stepped onto the street in the noonday sun and began the short walk to my rescuer. Every corner I took and every alleyway I passed, I expected the creature to suddenly fly out, attacking me in broad daylight as it had in years past. But it didn\u2019t. I came to the home office of my rescuer and we talked for nearly two hours. He explained to me that he had something that would help me. It was not a rescuer any more than he was, but if I chose to wield this new weapon against my monster, I may very well be able to rescue myself. He said it would take weeks, perhaps months, but it was the best chance to rid myself of the monster. Having no other options at my disposal and desperate for any relief from my present tortured existence, I accepted this help. \n        September 14, 1991: Days and then weeks went by and I still waited for the creature to disappear or perhaps die or maybe even leave in a dramatic huff. But as the man had told me, this weapon was not instantaneous. Suddenly, I realized the monster had seemed less committed in its last attack on my body, as if it knew it should hurt me but had lost its passion for beastly violence. I did not feel the same overwhelming nausea in its presence and for the first time in a long time, it let me leave to go around the corner to the market on Saturday. When I returned, I was able to eat some of the fruit I had picked up and though I saw the monster lurking beneath my bed, it seemed old and tired. It glanced at me with sleepy, sulking eyes but did no more than that. In the days that followed, my monster grew smaller and weaker.\n        September 23, 1991: On this day, my monster had dissipated into a tiny shadow of its former self. The power such a frail thing once wielded in my life seemed fantastical in hindsight. The first day of fall reminded me how letting go of the past can be so very beautiful.\n        October 16, 1991: I stepped into the small, back room in the church reception hall. I nervously glanced around the circle of chairs, each filled by an equally nervous individual, clutching their purses in their laps, rubbing the backs of their hands in anticipation, or letting out a soft, reserved laugh in some small conversation with each other. I looked over at the clock on the wall, and I knew it was time.\n        I didn\u2019t think about my mouth. I didn\u2019t think about the way my tongue lay there stiff and clumsy. I didn\u2019t think about the crease in my blouse sleeve or the way my right arm held onto my left elbow as if holding on for dear life. I didn\u2019t think about any of the many minute details of my existence that had previously consumed me. Most of all, I didn\u2019t think about the monster that had previously held me hostage, beaten me, and choked my inner voice.  Instead, all I could think was how I didn\u2019t feel good or bad, I just felt like\u2026me. Perhaps this is what Dr. Molloy meant when he told me that one day soon I would feel better. Indeed, after weeks of taking this new wonderdrug he referred to as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, my monster was gone.\n        I stood up and, giving a shy wave with my left hand, my right still carefully holding it at the elbow for a bit of extra comfort, I spoke. \n        \u201cHi everyone. My name is Hannah Greenberg and I have social anxiety.\u201d \n"}

Panorama Projects would be lucky to have you.\u201d She took another deep breath, grabbed her bag and portfolio, and headed out the door. \n        As she entered the lobby of Panorama Projects\u2019 corporate offices, the butterflies in Candace\u2019s stomach began their wild dance again. She pressed a fist against her belly button, taking deep breaths in, holding them, and releasing them, like her yoga teacher had instructed her to do. She repeated this five times until she felt her nerves calm. She had been unemployed for the past six months due to layoffs, and she didn\u2019t know if she could take another rejection, another \u201cyou\u2019re highly qualified, but we don\u2019t think you\u2019re right for this position.\u201d What did that even mean, anyway?

A man was there, also waiting for the elevators, and he smiled at her. She was too nervous about the interview to make pleasant small talk with a stranger, so she smiled back but did not encourage any further interactions. The two of them stood silently, staring at the closed doors before them. \n        After what felt like hours, the elevator door glided open, and the man gestured for Candace to step inside. She nodded curtly and entered the elevator, standing in the furthest corner and staring directly ahead. \n        \u201cWhat floor?\u201d The man asked. \n        \u201cTwenty-two.\u201d \n        He pressed the button and then leaned against the wall opposite Candace, staring down at his phone, scrolling silently. The elevator whirred, moving them upward through the building. Candace watched as the numbers above the door clicked higher and higher. \n        As the elevator approached the twenty-second floor, it suddenly sputtered, the motor ceasing abruptly. Without warning, Candace and the man were at a standstill in the motionless elevator. \n        \u201cWhoa. What just happened?\u201d The man said, pressing buttons on the panel. \n        \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to do anything!\u201d Candace snapped at him.\n        The man took a step back, surprise registering on his face. He put his hands up in defense. \u201cHey, sorry, I was just trying to troubleshoot,\u201d he said. \n        Candace, looking appropriately abashed, apologized to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have an interview today, and I am so nervous. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you.\u201d \n        \u201cWhat\u2019s the interview for?\u201d The man asked.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a project manager role with the customer service department.\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cAnd the interview is supposed to start in five minutes, so barring a miracle, it looks like I have another rejection ahead of me.\u201d Candace slumped back against the wall in defeat. \n        \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d A voice asked from the elevator control panel.\n        Candace looked at the man, alarmed. The man shrugged. \n        \u201cYes, hi! There are two of us in this elevator, and it just stopped working!\u201d Candace shouted into the panel.\n        \u201cOkay, ma\u2019am, hold tight,\u201d the voice said. \n        A few minutes later, the voice came across the panel again. \u201cCan you tell if the issue is with the whole building, or just your elevator?\u201d the voice asked. Candace pressed her ear to the door, listening. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a building-wide power outage. It sounds business-as-usual out there, so I think it might just be our elevator.\u201d\n        \u201cOkay,\u201d the voice responded. \u201cCan you confirm the address of your elevator?\u201d \n        The man stepped forward. \u201cYes, we are at the corporate offices for Panorama Projects, located at 2000 Memorial Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, 02140.\u201d \n        \u201cThank you.

Now I\u2019ve lost this opportunity before I ever even had it,\u201d she groaned.  \n        The man slid down to sit across from her. \u201cI\u2019m sure the company knows about the elevator,\u201d he said reassuringly. \n\tCandace shrugged. \u201cWho knows?\u201d she said, \u201cbut now I am so rattled, and I know I\u2019m going to blow it, even if they still interview me!\u201d \n        Candace could hear people outside the elevator doors. \u201cWhat is taking this elevator so long?\u201d \u201cWhy aren\u2019t these doors opening?\u201d Someone started pounding on the door, trying to pry it open. \n        \u201cCut it out!\u201d Candace shouted. The pounding stopped.\n        \u201cA technician is on their way, and they said to leave it alone,\u201d she yelled through the closed elevator doors. The voices slowly faded, and once again, Candace and the man were left alone. \n        \u201cWhat if I helped you prepare for the interview?\u201d the man offered. Candace smiled at him. He was being so nice to her, clearly trying to take her mind off the situation they were in, and after she had been so gruff with him. \n        \u201cAnd how do you suppose we do that?\u201d she asked, sitting up straighter. \n        \u201cWell, I can mock-interview you, just to get you in the right headspace and help you feel more prepared.\u201d \n        Candace considered this for a minute. \u201cOkay, sure,\u201d she finally agreed. \n        \u201cAlright, what is the interviewer\u2019s name?\u201d the man asked.\n        \u201cDoug Miller.\u201d \n        \u201cOkay, and your name?\u201d \n        \u201cCandace Brown.\u201d \n        \u201cOkay, Ms. Brown, I\u2019m Mr. Miller, nice to meet you.\u201d The man held his hand out, and Candace shook it, laughing. \n        The man sat up straighter and, with a mock-serious tone, he asked, \u201cMs. Brown, what do you think you would bring to this position?\u201d\n        Candace considered the question for a minute before she said, \u201cI have five years of experience as a project manager and ten years experience in customer service. I am hardworking, punctual, creative, and a go-getter. I know I would be an asset to Panorama Projects.\u201d \n        The man nodded appreciatively. \u201cThat\u2019s a great answer,\u201d he said. \n        \u201cMa\u2019am, Sir, stay calm,\u201d a voice said from outside the elevator. \u201cWe are just going to manually open these doors, and then you will be able to exit safely.\u201d \n        Candace grinned at the man and pulled herself up. She dusted off her skirt and picked up her purse and portfolio. A few minutes later, the technician pulled the elevator door open, and Candace and the man stepped out into the twenty-second floor lobby. \n        Candace thanked the technician before turning to the man. \n        \u201cThank you so much. You really helped to take my mind off of the elevator and stay focused on this interview.\u201d\n        \u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d the man said. \n        \u201cWait, you never told me your name,\u201d Candace said.\n        The man grinned and held out his hand. \u201cMy name is Doug Miller.\u201d \n        Candace couldn\u2019t hide the shock on her face. \u201cWait, you\u2019re Doug Miller? Why didn\u2019t you say anything!? That was a sneaky thing you did, not revealing your identity!\u201d\n        He shrugged, still smiling. \u201cYou were already so anxious about the interview and being late, I didn\u2019t want to add on. Besides, you handled the interview without the stress of even knowing you were in an interview!\u201d He gestured down the hallway. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get your new-hire paperwork started.\u201d \n"}

The group was part new age, part apocalyptic, all authoritarian. She was one of the twenty-six children of leader Abraham Simeon, but only her twelve-year-old sister, Sarah, shared the same mother. They barely even saw their mother now. During the day, she was kept busy with her job in the kitchen. In the evening, she studied scripture and tended to Abraham. Children were an inconvenience to the adults and were left to mostly fend for themselves. Even surrounded by eighty-five members, the sisters felt like they only had each other.\n        Tensions were high as November 20 approached. For the fifth time in as many years, Abraham had prophesied the last day on Earth. However, he assured his faithful followers that those that made the vortexual leap with him would rise to a high astral plane. With each failed prediction, members grew more doubtful. Abraham would explain that God spared them because of their hard work and commitment to him. Followers held tight to their faith by a thread, as Abraham became more desperate in his message. \n        Members rarely left the confines of the compound. When they did, it was under the watchful eye of one of the elders.

They sounded concerned too,\u201d Miriam said.\n        They sat in another long silence. Miriam\u2019s eyes filled with tears. She broke the silence when she choked, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d         \n        Sarah couldn\u2019t look at her sister. Slump-shouldered, she nodded. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \n        The girls didn\u2019t want to draw attention to themselves, so they could only take a few small belongings. It wasn\u2019t like they had much anyway. Miriam gathered a few precious items. She packed a small stuffed cat her maternal grandmother gave her when she was six. It was the only year she got to spend Christmas on the outside. She had a few photos and cards. She made sure she had a birthday card from her Aunt Charlotte. It had a return address. Since their aunt was the only one they knew on the outside, she prayed this address would lead them to her.\n        Miriam slung the messenger bag over her shoulder and met Sarah by the office. \n        \u201cReady?\u201d Sarah asked. Her voice shook. Miriam nodded.\n        The two walked into the office and were greeted by Abraham\u2019s assistant. Miriam lightly pushed Sarah forward. \n        \u201cHi, yeah. We\u2019re working on a craft project, and we can't get in the supply closet. C-c-can you unlock it?\u201d Sarah asked.\n        \u201cSure, hon,\u201d the assistant said as she grabbed her keys from her desk drawer. \n        Miriam watched the two disappear down the hall. She reached in her pocket and pulled out a pizza parlor ad that she had torn out of the contraband newspaper.\n        It took four rings for them to answer, but Miriam remained calm, \u201cHi, I need a large pepperoni pizza delivered to Highway 158 and County Road 2300. Thirty minutes? Great, thanks!\u201d\n        Miriam met Sarah and the assistant in the hallway. They thanked the assistant, and the girls hurried down the hallway and out the door. Sarah tossed her newly acquired glue and markers in some bushes. She did, however, tuck the pair of scissors in her back pocket. Just in case. Once they determined there was no one around, they raced to the woods behind the compound. \n        The leaves were beginning to turn shades of orange and yellow. Branches scraped their faces and hands as they scurried over fallen leaves. They didn\u2019t stop or look back until they reached the creek that bordered the property. They paused for only a minute to catch their breath. Miriam examined the rushing creek. The once trickle was a sanctuary where Miriam would go to play with her sister or to sometimes seek solitude. Now, fall rains had flooded the stream that stood between them and freedom. She finally gathered enough courage to take the first step in. She held her messenger bag above her head as she waded waist-deep into the freezing water. The chill took her breath away. Her sister followed. \n        Sarah wanted to collapse on the bank when they reached the safety of the other side, but Miriam pulled her by the arm. There was no time to lose. They made their way to the intersection Miriam told the pizza place. They stood on the shoulder of the highway, analyzing the few cars that sped by. Finally, a faded blue sedan with a \u201cGino\u2019s Pizza\u201d car topper slowed at the intersection. The girls dashed to greet the confused driver that was reviewing the address.\n        Miriam was so relieved to see him and overcome with emotion. She began sobbing. She read his name tag. \u201cTyler, please. It\u2019s my order. We just need a ride. Anywhere. Please. Help us,\u201d Miriam desperately begged. \n        Tyler wanted to speed off.  He had heard stories about the unhinged cult in this area and was warned to stay away. He feared this might be a trick to lure him in. There was an urgency in the girls\u2019 teary eyes. Miriam put her hands on the window as she pleaded. Sarah nervously scanned the scene like an animal being pursued. \n        \u201cPlease!\u201d The sisters cried in unison. He told the soaked and freezing girls to jump in. \n        On the ride to the restaurant, the girls explained everything: Abraham, the prophecy, the smuggled newspaper, the thirty charges their leader was facing, talk of a standoff. It must have sounded crazy to an outsider, but Tyler listened and reassured them that he would get them help.\n        At the restaurant, Tyler sat with the girls. The owner stormed over to investigate why his driver was taking a break during the lunch rush. The girls told him about their harrowing escape. They shared the danger they faced of being locked away forever if the group elders, or Lord forbid, Abraham himself, caught them before they could get to their aunt. He felt a pang of guilt for his abrasive behavior. To make amends, he insisted they eat the pizza they ordered, on the house of course. He brought over an offering of sodas and breadsticks as well.\n        Tyler pulled out his phone. \u201cLet\u2019s find your aunt.\u201d\n        Miriam presented the envelope with her aunt\u2019s address to Tyler. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s still there, but she\u2019s the only person I can think of.\u201d\n        The girls watched wide-eyed as Tyler tapped away on his phone screen, scrolling and sliding. \u201cAh, ha!\u201d Tyler announced in a few short minutes. He pushed the phone across the table. \u201cIs this her?\u201d\n        Miriam gazed at the phone in amazement. The picture looked so much like her mother. Though she had only met her Aunt Charlotte twice, when she was very young, she immediately knew it was her. Miriam squeezed her sister\u2019s hand.\n        \u201cIs she at the same address? Can we call her? Do we need to drive over there?\u201d Miriam asked, rapid fire. \n        \u201cWe\u2019ll just DM her,\u201d Tyler responded. The girls stared blankly. \u201cOn social media.\u201d He was met by more stares. \u201cWe\u2019ll send her a message.\u201d\n        The girls dictated as Tyler typed the note and hit send. She responded almost immediately. It was almost a two-hour drive, but without hesitation, she confirmed she was on her way.\n        \u201cYou should be a detective!\u201d Sarah gushed. Tyler blushed. \n        The girls waited nervously at the table. Sarah mindlessly fumbled with the parmesan shaker. Miriam scanned the menu over and over to pass the time and quiet her thoughts.  Surely someone had realized they were missing by now. Each time the door opened, she sank down in her chair, fearing they would be apprehended. \n        Two hours passed, and Miriam began to worry. What if her aunt changed her mind? What would they do? Where would they go? \n        The door to the restaurant flung open. Aunt Charlotte entered wildly, searching for her nieces. She looked so much like their mother, but there was a warmth in her eyes. The girls jumped up and ran to their aunt. Charlotte swept them into her arms and gently smoothed their hair.\n        \u201cOh, my sweet girls,\u201d Charlotte whispered as the girl cried on her shoulder.\n         Miriam and Sarah had never felt such kindness and love before. They had never been comforted or embraced by their parents.\n        Tears ran down Charlotte\u2019s cheeks as she assured the girls, \u201cYou\u2019re finally safe.\u201d\n        For the first time ever, they knew they would be okay.\n"}

It was 1998, and I, Jane Hamilton, was nearly done with my middle school nightmare. To be fair, middle school is hell for the majority of kids. But as a 13-year-old girl from the Grits Capital of Warwick, Georgia (population 725), deep in the heart of the rural South, this hell was both hot and humid. \n        Life in South Georgia had always been an awkward combination for me of rural isolation and painful boredom, peppered with quaint local customs, such as the annual grits festival, or just flat out backwoods debauchery in the form of mud bogging. Warwick was a tiny town composed largely of families with farming lineages that stretched back into the 1800s. Few new people ever moved to the town, and fewer still ever left it. I descended from a long line of turnip green farmers on my father\u2019s side and peanut farmers on my mother\u2019s side. As high school sweethearts, my father and mother vowed to get out of Warwick together. They attended college at the University of Georgia and then got married. My mother completed her degree in English literature while my father worked his way through graduate school in mechanical engineering. \n        But, as I have learned the hard way, fate has its own agenda. In 1982, my grandfather died of a massive heart attack. My parents moved back home so my father could take over the family farm supply store in granddad\u2019s absence. My mother got a job at her old high school teaching English classes and soon gave birth to my older sister, Margaret. Two years later, she had me and my twin sister Ellen, and then five years after that, my parents completed the family with the birth of my baby brother Harry.\n        We were one big, happy, weird family. Owing to my parents' partial escape from our small town in their younger days, we grew up knowing and learning about the outside world. Thanks to the influences of my mother, we were all avid early readers of both classic and modern literature. My father taught us about the wonders of the natural world and of man-made machinery. Unfortunately for my father, the bulk of the machines that were available to study in our neck of the woods were tractors and tractor accessories at the family store. My parents, I think, had hoped for cookie-cutter versions of themselves when they gave birth to us. The end product was something quite different. \n        My baby brother, Harry, took after my father in many ways, more than any of the rest of us. Harry already showed an aptitude for science and loved the outdoors. Rather than gushing over Batman, he idolized the Crocodile Hunter. He watched every public television nature documentary he could find, and my parents mounted a growing debt in stuffed animals for his room. But in my 8th grade year, my brother developed a very specific interest in turtles.\n        Not to toot my own horn, but I was the best of the bunch. I was sophisticated and intelligent. Most of all, I was an artist at heart. One day I planned on moving to New York City to become a writer and all-around bombshell babe just like my idol, Carrie Delacraw, on my favorite television show, \u201cMaking Love and the Metropolis.\u201d Though my father endlessly complained that the show was inappropriate for my age, my mother allowed me to watch it. She told my father that she had once had similar New York City dreams (minus the bombshell babe bit) and that I likely heard worse on the school bus ride each morning. Outside of my Big Apple obsession, I was also, most unfortunately, a social pariah at school. With a mop of curly red hair, very large glasses, and a mouthful of metal braces, I did not evoke the stunning allure of a sophisticated city socialite. I knew that with time and with fashion, my social standing would rise once those around me realized the treasure in their midst, or so I hoped. \n        My twin sister, Ellen, had given up on \u201cfitting in\u201d entirely. Since she was small, her obsession with history veered into mental dysfunction. At the age of six, she started reading the Little House on the Prairie series. This year also began her wearing of bonnets and keeping a small store of onions and potatoes under her bed for the hard winter ahead. In third grade, she learned of the Salem Witch Trials and refused to dress as anything other than a witch with a fake noose around her neck for Halloween. When my mother suggested she at least wear a pointy hat so people did not think she was deranged, she refused, arguing that polyester was not a historically accurate textile choice. Her latest historic obsession, after reading Animal Farm by George Orwell, was all things Communist. My father swore up and down that if she was not on some government watch list yet, she would be soon.\n        My older sister was the most \u201cnormal\u201d of our little crew and was a typical country teenager. At fifteen years old, Maggie loved all the standard pastimes of teens in the southern farmlands of Georgia. Her weekends were spent in cowboy boots and a tube top, rambling about town with various farm boys, usually in the back of someone\u2019s pickup truck. A six-pack of stolen beer and an afternoon swimming in the creek were the pinnacle of fun in Warwick. While my parents reluctantly tolerated my sister\u2019s dalliances in these typical rites of passage in my hometown (outside of the stolen beer, of course), they did insist on her taking part in at least one school-related activity. So in her freshman year of high school, my sister chose theater. Surprisingly to all of us, she was quite good at it. It is here that my story of death by embarrassment truly begins.\n        At the end of my 8th grade year, the high school spring production was Titanic:The Musical. Needless to say, it was the late 1990s, and the Titanic was more than a little popular at the time owing to a certain blockbuster film on the subject. The high school theater director decided that the world needed a new narrative version of the film in the form of a truly terrible musical. My sister, as usual, received a major role as the unsinkable Molly Brown. While she was not a fan of the costume, she was a fan of the finale, where she got to tap dance in a lifeboat. \n        On the night of the play's debut, our entire family filed into the school auditorium along with half of the town. My sister Ellen and I sat in the front row while Daddy, Mama, and Harry sat behind us. Unbeknownst to any of us, Harry had found a very cantankerous snapping turtle in the backyard only three hours before showtime. Growing up in the South, my grandmother always warned us not to mess with snapping turtles. \n        She would always warn the grandkids in the summer months, \u201cNever tease a snapping turtle. If they bite ya, they won\u2019t let go til lightning strikes.\u201d\n        My brother decided he would test this theory later, carefully placing the turtle in my mother's purse as we loaded ourselves into the car to head to the auditorium. \n        The play was going perfectly, and my mother was pleased as punch to see my sister gallantly saving the freezing refugees from the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 waters of the stage. My father endlessly muttered under his breath that the scaffolding beneath the Titanic\u2019s helm at the front of the stage was not structurally sound, only to be shushed by me. I was having a hard enough time following the plot with Ellen whispering her own complaints about the bourgeois celebration of working-class exploitation without having to listen to my father as well. I was feeling particularly chic in my new designer miniskirt with the bedazzled pockets and imagined myself attending some fancy Broadway number when the series of unfortunate events began.\n        Just as Mack and Lilly, the star-crossed lovers of the musical, belted out a melancholy number about a lonely iceberg, my mother reached into her purse for a mint. She let out a scream, flinging a round and leathery creature into my seat just in front of her. Before I had time to turn around, I felt a very strong tug at the top of my skirt and a wet, scaly sensation just on the small of my back. In seconds, I looked down to see a yellow and black reptilian nightmare scrambling with tiny, mud-laced feet as he clamped his pointed mouth onto my skirt.\n        And then, like one of those perpetual motion machines my dad always wanted to build, things moved into motion that would go down in history at my school. I leapt from my seat and spun around in a vain attempt to break loose from the turtle's eternal vise. But all this did was send the turtle flying onto the stage and into the face of Captain Edward Smith, played by Bradley Ellis, the only boy in the high school that could grow a full beard. He let out an unceremonious cry as he batted at the flying turtle, only to smack my sister Maggie, who was still busy herding her crew of Titanic refugees into her lifeboat, square in the face. My older sister, stunned and shocked, lost her footing and fell headfirst into the faux sea, kicking the helm of the shaky Titanic.\n        The Titanic collapsed in a heap, taking down Captain Smith and half the crew in the process. A gaggle of Irish immigrant dancers spilled off the stage except for the smallest one, who yelped as he kicked at the turtle now attached firmly to his right dancing shoe. My brother, recalling my sister Ellen's obsession last year with Native Puebloan rain dance rituals, went into action. He ripped off his shirt and started gyrating wildly in the front row in a vain attempt to conjure up a lightning storm to make the turtle let go of his most recent victim. While my mother scrambled onto the stage to help the victims of this epic tragedy, my sister Ellen was no help at all. At the peak of the chaos, she simply stood up and began to sing \u201cL'Internationale,\u201d the socialist anthem, with her hand pressed above her heart. \n        I watched all of this in horror, only to feel a chill on my backside. It was at that point that I realized that the turtle had ripped my beloved designer skirt and part of my underwear, exposing half of my rear end along with a pair of very comfortable but very large granny panties. As silly as it may seem, I was less concerned with my revealed rear-end than I was with my exposed secret; I didn\u2019t own a single pair of Veronica\u2019s Closet undergarments. I would carry the nickname \u201cmegapanties\u201d through the rest of my school days. \n        As the high school principal sounded the fire alarm and directed the raucous audience of students and parents out the exit doors, I couldn\u2019t help but wish I had foregone my skirt that night for something a bit more turtle-proof. It was on evenings such as this that I wished I could sink into obscurity rather than the spotlight I so frequently craved. \n        But in the words of my wise sister Ellen, \u201cHistory can only be made by those who chose to rock, or in this case, sink the boat.\u201d\n"}

Everyone bringing food was supposed to be early. That meant James was due to arrive in the next thirty minutes.\n\tBobby didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to look James in the eye, and that was dangerous. The whole family knew he was the leaky pot. If he knew something, there was no need for prying. All you had to do was give him a stern look. Almost every family secret had been spilled by Bobby. \n\t\u201cI\u2019m gonna go, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d Bobby grabbed his coat and made his way to the door. Maven\u2019s hands were deep in the sweet potato bread mix. She yelled at her twin, \u201cWhen you gonna grow up and learn to keep your lips tight? People will wonder why you aren\u2019t here.\u201d \n\t\u201cLet\u2019em,\u201d Bobby shouted back. He sighed as he opened the door.

They moved into the house toward the kitchen.\n\t\"I've got Mama's potato salad and ribs ready to grill. You on the grill today?\" James asked.\n\tBobby skirted away. The less he spoke or reacted, the better. \n\tOnce they were in the kitchen, he\u2019d be in the clear. Maven was known to be a talker, and Bobby could use that as cover to run. \n\tMaven pulled James into a deep embrace, as he sat the box on the table. She shook her eyes at Bobby, who was trying to gracefully exit. \n\t\u201cYou look good, how are you feeling?\u201d Maven asked as she released James.\n\t\u201cToday is a good day. I feel good and look better,\u201d James laughed. \n\tMaven smiled, despite everything, James' spirits were good; this was the point of the cookout. This was the Baker family way. When anyone was going through something, the family gathered, laughed, and ate. \n\t\u201cSo, who\u2019s grill\u2019n?\u201d James questioned.\n\t\u201cGuess I am,\u201d Bobby offered.

What\u2019s up?\u201d James asked, \u201cY'all weirded out by the testing?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo\u2026 Maybe a little, but you know, we got you,\u201d Maven smiled.\n\t\u201cI know Bobby and some of the kids don\u2019t like needles. I don\u2019t want people to feel like they have to,\u201d Bobby offered.\n\tMaven chuckled. \u201cGrown folks' fear of needles don't mean nothing.\u201d \n\tJames, exhaled hard. \u201cI\u2019m a little scared no one is gonna be a match.

Maven and Bobby looked at each other, then James. He\u2019d surely lost it. The stress of his illness and the news must have shook a screw loose. Maven touched James' arm. \n\tJames covered his mouth and calmed himself. He smiled at his siblings. \u201cY'all two are about five years late.\u201d \n\tAstonishment and relief swept over Maven and Booby. \u201cYou knew, why didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d Maven pressed.\n\t\u201cProbably the same reason y'all weren\u2019t planning on telling me,\u201d James smiled.\n\t\u201cJust for the record, I wanted to tell you,\u201d Bobby said. \n\t\u201cLook, Ma told me when she first got sick.

Mr. Pickles,\u201d she called out for the cat.\n        Kit panicked. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have my cards or anything. It might be best just to set up an app-\u201d\n        \u201cNonsense!\u201d Emma went in search of her cat.\n        Mark yanked Kit into a corner. \u201cWhy is my boss hunting for her cat so that you can,\u201d he made air quotes,  \u201cread it?\u201d he hissed. \n        \u201cSo, funny story,\u201d Kit said.\n        \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a real hoot. Like Mr. Pickles,\u201d Mark said sarcastically.\n        Kit continued. \u201cYou know, that tutoring job I have three nights a week. I\u2019m not EXACTLY a tutor.\u201d Mark stared silently, arms crossed. \u201cI have a very lucrative career as a pet psychic at the metaphysical shop downtown.\u201d\n        \u201cAre you insane?\u201d Mark asked.\n        \u201cSee,\u201d said Kit, \u201cthat is exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you. The shop was hiring, I love animals. I\u2019ve always wanted to be psychic. It\u2019s destiny.\u201d\n        \u201cYou are not psychic. You\u2019re a charlatan,\u201d Mark snapped.\n        \u201cWell, that\u2019s your opinion. I\u2019m so gifted. Coco is thriving on her new gluten-free diet,\u201d Kit said. \n        \u201cCoco?\u201d Mark asked.\n        \u201cMrs. Whitlock\u2019s chihuahua.\u201d Kit replied.\n        Mark rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re going, now.\u201d\n        At that moment, Emma reemerged with Mr. Pickles struggling to escape her grasp. She excitedly handed the cat to Kit. She cradled him like a baby and carefully sat on the green velvet sofa. Mr. Pickles let out a low growl and swatted her nose. Kit gently touched the cat\u2019s fluffy belly, and he rabbit-kicked her with his back feet. \n        \u201cOh. Hmm. Is that right? Makes sense.\u201d Kit made a great show of responding to Mr. Pickles\u2019 thoughts. \u201cIf I understand correctly, his stomach is upset. He snuck some dairy, and it really didn\u2019t agree with him.\u201d\n        Emma gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cI caught him eating some-\u201d She caught herself. \u201cSome yogurt last night.\u201d\n        \u201cDo you have an item that is special to Mr. Pickles?\u201d Kit asked. \n        It was a trick she learned from binge-watching TV psychics. It added soul and authenticity to her readings. Emma presented Kit with a gray catnip mouse. She closed her eyes and pressed the toy mouse to her heart with one hand. She restrained a vocal and disgruntled Mr. Pickles with the other. \n        \u201cHe is showing me that he has felt a very deep connection with you since he first saw you at the rescue,\u201d Kit said.\n\tEmma frowned and tilted her head. \u201cOn the street?\u201d Kit asked. Emma became irritated. \u201cIn the dumpster?\u201d Kit continued. \n\tEmma grasped her chest, \u201cMr. Theodore Von Pickles is NOT a dumpster cat. I\u2019ll have you know he is purebred. His parents are champions.\u201d\n        \u201cHold up.\u201d Kit stood up and released Mr. Pickles. He darted under the dining table and licked his back leg aggressively. \n        \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that with millions of homeless cats in the world, you bought one? From a breeder? Paid cash money,\u201d Kit continued. \u201cNo wonder he resents you.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat?\u201d Emma asked. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d\n        \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t. You clearly do not understand him. He said you don\u2019t even care enough to neuter him. That\u2019s why he pees on the drapes!\u201d\n        \u201cHe does no such thing!\u201d Emma shouted.\n        \u201cWe can all smell it, Carol!\u201d Kit shouted back.\n        \u201cWho\u2019s Carol? My name is Emma!\u201d\n        \u201cExactly!\u201d Kit triumphantly cried out. \n        Confused guests whispered amongst themselves. Coats in hand, Mark appeared and took Kit by the hand. He placed his other hand on her back. \u201cThank you for the lovely evening. We\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d\n        Mark pushed a huffing Kit to the door. Before he could get the door closed, Kit poked her head in one more time. \u201cMr. Pickles licked the spinach dip you\u2019re all eating!\u201d\n        The ride home was silent, except for the podcast playing quietly through the car speakers. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kit finally said. \u201cI got carried away.\u201d\n        Red-faced with nostrils flared, Mark glared straight ahead at the road.\n        \u201cWell, you hated that job anyway,\u201d Kit added.\n        Mark rolled to a stop at the red light. \n        \u201cI can put in a good word for you at the metaphysical shop,\u201d Kit quipped. \n        Mark faced Kit with his mouth open, ready to speak. Instead, he bit his lip and turned the volume up full blast.\n        The Mr. Theodore Von Pickles incident was never mentioned again.\n"}

Plus, she\u2019s Suzie\u2019s cousin. And I\u2019m not going to uninvite Suzie, she\u2019s my literal best friend, Luke.\u201d \n\tLuke wiped his hands on the hanging towel and shook his head. \u201cWhatever, Care, I just think she sucks, and I think we would all have a better time without her.\u201d \n\t\"Oh, come on, Luke, she isn\u2019t that bad.

Not exactly an \u2018avoid her\u2019 situation.\u201d \n\tCarrie walked over and kissed Luke on the cheek. \u201cListen, I know Janet annoys you the most, but it\u2019s because she has a crush on you.\u201d She took Luke\u2019s face in both of her hands and grinned up at him. \u201cAnd why wouldn\u2019t she? You\u2019re absolutely adorable.\u201d \n\tLuke laughed, sighing. \u201cOkay, okay. Fine. I\u2019ll play nice. But I\u2019m doing it under protest.\u201d \n\tWhen they arrived at Mack\u2019s house, Suzie and Janet were already there, helping Mack put out snacks on the coffee table. Suzie ran over, hugging Carrie and Luke tightly. Janet followed her, wholly ignoring Carrie as she narrowed her eyes at Luke. \n\t\u201cWell, Luke, don\u2019t you look nice?\u201d she purred, reaching out and stroking the sleeve of his shirt. Luke yanked his arm away as though he\u2019d been burned. \n\t\u201cHi, Janet,\u201d he said tersely. Janet ignored his tone, turning to Carrie. \n\t\"Hey, Carrie Beary,\u201d Janet said, reaching out to hug her. Carrie accepted the hug and stifled her laugh as Luke mimed himself vomiting over Janet\u2019s shoulder. \n\tJust then, Mack came down the stairs. \u201cCarrie! Luke! Welcome to my place!\u201d \n\t\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Carrie asked, looking around. \n\t\u201cAh, they went to Bermuda for my dad\u2019s work conference. It\u2019s just me and my sister \u2018til Wednesday.\u201d\n\t\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t throw a wild rager?\u201d Suzie asked teasingly. They all knew that Mack was an introvert and could barely handle the seven members of their current friend group; he most certainly would not be hosting any \u2018wild ragers\u2019 in his lifetime.  He high-fived each of them before excusing himself to finish getting the snacks and drinks ready. \n\t\u201cHey man, let me give you a hand,\u201d Luke said, following Mack into the kitchen. \n\tA few minutes later, their friends, Carter and Douglas, had arrived and everyone was hanging out in Mack's living room, eating chips and dip and sipping sodas. \n\t\u201cI have an idea!\u201d Janet said. Luke groaned, and Carrie smacked his arm. \n\t\u201cCut it out!\u201d she whispered. \n\t\u201cLet\u2019s play Truth or Dare!\u201d Janet squealed, looking around at everyone.\n\tThe group all exchanged looks, each nodding and shrugging. \n\t\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Mack agreed. \n\t\u201cYay! Okay, I\u2019ll go first!\u201d Janet said, looking at Carrie with a mischievous grin. \n\t\u201cCarrie, truth or dare?\u201d she asked. \n\t\u201cTruth.\u201d \n\tJanet\u2019s grin widened. \u201cOkay, is it true that you wet the bed until you were twelve?\u201d\n\tCarrie\u2019s face fell, and blood rushed to her cheeks. Without answering, Carrie burst into tears and ran from the room. \n\t\u201cCarrie, wait!\u201d Suzie yelled, hurrying after her. She shot Janet a glare as she passed her. Janet smiled innocently. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \n\t\u201cYou know what! She told us that in confidence, Janet!\u201d Suzie said, shaking her head in disgust. \n\tSuzie found Carrie in the guest bathroom, sitting on the edge of the bathtub, sobbing. Suzie sat down next to her and rubbed her back affectionately. \n\t\u201cCare, honey, it\u2019s okay. Really. You were a kid, and you didn\u2019t have any control over it. And it\u2019s been years. Everyone has embarrassing moments in their past.\u201d \n\tCarrie dropped her head into her hands, tears still streaming down her face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she would tell everyone that,\u201d she whispered. \n\t\u201cStay right here. I have an idea,\u201d Suzie said, getting up and leaving the bathroom. \n\tShe returned a few minutes later. \u201cCarrie, come with me, please.\u201d \n\tCarrie shook her head. \u201cNo way. I can\u2019t face any of them,\u201d she protested. \n\tSuzie grabbed her hand, pulling her up. \u201cPlease, just trust me,\u201d she said. \n\tCarrie wiped the tears from her eyes and unwillingly followed her best friend back into the living room. She sat down on the couch next to Luke, who put his arm around her and pulled her close.\n\t\u201cBabe,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. No one cares.\u201d She peeked at him through tear-soaked eyelashes and saw how earnestly he was looking back at her. She relaxed a little, leaning into Luke\u2019s side. \n\t\u201cCarrie,\u201d Suzie said, taking her hand. \u201cEveryone has embarrassing things from their childhood. Hell, some even from adulthood,\u201d she said, looking pointedly at Mack. \n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true, Carrie,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI sucked my thumb until I was fourteen!\u201d \n\t\u201cAnd I wrote a really detailed love note to my crush in middle school, and she read it out loud in front of the entire class,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cI skipped school for a week after that.\u201d \n\tLuke cleared his throat. \u201cI had a crush on my mom\u2019s best friend growing up. I was like ten, and she was like forty. But I was so in love with her, I used to secretly plan marriage proposals for her.\u201d \n\tCarrie laughed but then covered her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh. Thank you all for sharing these. It does make me feel better.\u201d \n\t\u201cAnd you already know this, but I\u2019ll share mine, too,\u201d Suzie said, pulling her tablet out of her bag. \u201cI write Galaxy Voyager fan fiction and post it on my blog.\u201d She opened the website and held it up as proof. \n\tMack cleared his throat and pulled something from behind the couch. It was a ratty old blanket. From the looks of it, it used to be a soft blue color, but was now more gray than anything. \n\t\u201cThis was my baby blanket that my mom brought me home from the hospital in. I have slept with it every night of my life. I still do,\u201d Mack said sheepishly. \n\tCarter reached over and clapped Mack on the shoulder. \u201cNothing to be ashamed of, bud,\u201d he said.\n\tCarrie looked at Janet, who had been sitting quietly. \n\t\u201cJanet,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cAnything to share?\u201d \n\tJanet looked around at everyone, looking back at her expectantly. \n\t\u201cI can\u2019t ride a bike,\u201d she said finally. The group erupted in anger. \n\t\u201cThat isn\u2019t an embarrassment!\u201d\n\t\u201cCome on, you can do better than that!\u201d\n\t\u201cTell us something actually embarrassing!\u201d\n\tJanet held her hands up in protest. \u201cOkay, okay, geez. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt anyone, y\u2019all are being too sensitive.\u201d \n\tSuzie glared at her. \u201cJanet, we all know you were absolutely trying to embarrass Carrie with your little game. So, share something or leave.\u201d \n\tJanet sighed. \u201cOkay, fine. I couldn\u2019t read until I was in high school, and my parents finally got me a tutor.\u201d \n\t\u201cThank you for sharing that, Janet,\u201d Carrie said. \n\t\u201cOkay, can we all go back to being friends again?\u201d Carter asked. He couldn\u2019t stand confrontation of any kind, and this evening had been enough to last him a lifetime. \n\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Douglas agreed. \u201cBesides, I want to read Suzie\u2019s fanfic!\u201d he yelled, grabbing the tablet from the coffee table and standing up to read to the group. \n\t\u201cOh no!\u201d Suzie groaned, reaching for the tablet. \u201cI shared that I write it\u2014we are not reading it!\u201d \n\tEveryone laughed, watching as Suzie chased Douglas through the house, Douglas shouting lines from Suzie\u2019s latest story.\n"}

When the storms of life are severe, my necklace is there. My friends always tell me to take it off. It would save me trouble, should the wrong person notice it. I can\u2019t do that. It means so much to me, to who I am, to whom I aspire to be. I have never understood why something so important to my identity can cause such a problem. It does not require anything of another person. It is my center, not theirs. They are free to ignore it. But their comments are so brutal.\n        I often walk at night and gaze upon the stars. Ever since I was a child, I have made a wish upon a star every night. Usually, it is a wish for a work in progress, or something I lack confidence to do, but must complete. It gives me a certain amount of comfort to tell the same star every night my tale of woe. My hopes. My dreams. No matter the chaos in my life, that star is always present. \n        Even on a stormy night, when I can\u2019t see my star, I know it is there shining as a constant in the darkness. If I feel that everything else is lost, my star is still there. My necklace represents that star to me in the daylight. \n        When I am anxious, my star is there around my neck, so I can touch it. It allows me to breathe, to make it through a difficult situation. I almost never talk about it to anyone. There has to be a really strong purpose for me to mention it. Otherwise, it is kept hidden, close to me. It is my secret to surviving difficult situations, a situation like the one about to unfold.\n        I was already sick with dread. I had a presentation to give. As for the professor, to say they were unkind is more than an understatement. No one survived their thirty minutes unscathed. I did not sleep the night before. I had low blood sugar and could not keep food down. This was a seriously bad combination, so I felt dizzy. My hands were cold. Furthermore, I always hated presentations, generally speaking, but this time, after the fate of those who went before me, I was beside myself with dread. I held my star. I just had to get through it.\n        I stepped up onto the archaic wood stage and took my place behind the podium. It felt like the whole world was slanting. My classmates and the professor blurred. The world appeared as if I was gazing through a kaleidoscope, lost in a storm at sea. I heard the waves crashing in my ears. I grabbed my star and tried to breathe. The blurs were all looking at me expectantly. They were waiting for me to begin. I needed to begin. I wanted to begin. Could I begin? \n        Oh, star. Star, please let the words come out. \n        I began, and it was brilliant, which was unexpected for me as well. I was as surprised as my classmates. They all laughed. I released my star. I was in the zone. My hand scrolled across the board with ease. Explanations were effortless. I did not need to look at my notes. It hadn\u2019t even gone this well in the shower this morning.\n        Then, against protocol, a classmate raised their hand during the presentation. I stopped and acknowledged them. They asked if perhaps I had just said what I had because of my star. I\u2019m not sure how they even knew, or why it mattered to them. \n        The floor felt like a sponge beneath me. All eyes were upon me. Silence fell in the room. I could feel the encompassing sound of nothingness and expectations. The precise nature of what was revealed was not as important as the fact it was brought to light. The unveiling had an impact on my life, and that was the salient point. \n        I felt an intense pressure behind my eyes and could hear a drumming sound. This presentation was really important for me and for my standing in the department. I felt the cold of panic set in. I couldn\u2019t allow myself to cry in front of them. Not for this. Weakness was not acceptable there. I wanted to speak, but my throat felt like there was a stone lodged inside. My heart was palpitating. I was so lost. \n        Then, in my mind, I heard the song I had played as a flute solo at a recital years ago, from Les Mis\u00e9rables: \u201cGod on high, hear my prayer, in my need, you have always been there.\u201d  I began to feel my breathing change as if I were playing the song. My fingers began to move and make the notes. \n        I reached for my star, as always, it was present. My voice came out of the darkness, surprising even me. I answered the question so concisely there was no room for them to say anything else. I answered as if they asked an academic question and gave them what the author I was presenting on might have said. Then, I continued on as if nothing had happened. But, something had happened to me.         \n        I finished my presentation. I asked if there were any questions, and there was applause. I felt as if I was watching the situation unravel from outside myself. There was also applause from the professor, who raised their hand to ask me a question, instead of asking me to take my seat. Usually, that is how presentations ended, they sent the presenter to their seat and then fixed all their perceived errors. That was what people remembered. I held the floor for the remainder of the class, and the professor raised his hand before speaking. That was what I remembered. \n        That day, no one remembered what that student had said, but they remembered my presentation and the reaction of the professor. It was all around the department. No one remembered the humiliating question. Except for me. \n        I never forgot. It was not the first time this had happened, it would not be the last. My academic integrity was called into question because of my beliefs. Everyone has beliefs. Their beliefs were considered to be on the spectrum of acceptable. Mine were not. It was humiliating. I survived it, but it changed me. \n        That moment of abject humiliation never leaves you. I know the embarrassment should be theirs, not mine. But here we are, judgment is not always just.\n"}
{"example_id":"example_037","inputs":"Write a story centered on an embarrassing secret revealed by someone's mother during a social gathering or event, in this case a wedding. The mother thinks she's revealing something scandalous and shocking, but in fact it's something silly. Specifically in this story, the mother reveals that the protagonist (her daugher-in-law) has only one cookbook, \"The Betsy Chowder Cookbook.\" The book is a strange knockoff of another more popular cookbook. It contains only outlandish chowder recipes such as pickle chowder or coffee chowder. Chowder, both the food and the word, is the basis for a lot of the humor in the story. The mother gets intoxicated at the wedding reception and goes on a rant about the cookbook during the toasts, a time when people are supposed to give their blessings to the couple, not rant about chowder. Make it first-person, from the bride's perspective, and limit the story to 1700 to 1800 words.","targets":"        \u201cThe only recipes I know are from this knock-off \u2018Betsy Chowder\u2019 cookbook from the early 1950s!\u201d \n        Boy, would this confession come back to haunt me. \n        My mother-in-law to-be had taken the time to come help us pack our stuff for the move to the new house, and I had gotten us two bottles of chardonnay to make the process easier. Cheryl is a pretty traditional lady and is not particularly keen on our \u201cmodern\u201d relationship. We did the hybrid-name thing - not hyphenated, but rather a whole new name. Leary plus Landon equals Leardon. This choice makes Ryan the end of the Landon family line in her eyes, but we\u2019d mostly gotten through the brunt of her reaction to that news by then. Can you feel my eyes rolling?\n        To be fair, the cookbook deserved her judgment. Even the famous red gingham cover was a bit off-center, and it was the wrong color red. Kind of a weird magenta. My best friend Carmen found it at a garage sale and gave it to me as a joke, but it\u2019s the only cookbook I have. The saddest part of all this is that I don\u2019t like chowder. I don\u2019t even like the word \u201cchowder,\u201d honestly. \n        I was, however, glad to have the help with moving to our new place. We really could\u2019ve timed it better, with the wedding happening a month after the move, but when the house you really want comes on the market, you have to pounce. We both got a little loose-lipped after finishing one of the bottles and starting the next while we packed the kitchen. That\u2019s when I showed her the infamous cookbook.\n        \u201cBetsy Chowder? I haven\u2019t seen one of these in years. I thought it got discontinued after that controversial coffee chowder recipe in one of the 70s editions.\u201d \n        \u201cIt\u2019s a rare, archival copy. What can I say?\u201d\n        \u201cYou need a real cookbook. My Ryan doesn\u2019t even like chowder.\u201d\n        But really, though, does anyone like chowder?\n\n        We somehow managed to pull off a wedding - one month after moving house - with sixty-three guests, five of whom had complicated dietary restrictions. Yes, there were typical wedding shenanigans, like twin flower girls who competed to see who could run down the aisle the fastest and dump all the petals at our feet. For the most part, however, we managed to enjoy the day sufficiently that our smiles in the photos look fairly natural. That felt like an accomplishment. \n        The cocktail hour between the ceremony and the reception gave the caterers time to set up the room for dinner and dancing. After the groom\u2019s family photo obligations were complete, Cheryl started hitting the chardonnay. That\u2019s when the trouble started.\n        Marcel, Ryan\u2019s best man, gave a funny, if slightly off-color toast, the central feature of which was ribbing Ryan about how long it takes him to fix his hair. They became friends when they were assigned as first-year roommates in college, so Marcel may have also mentioned Ryan\u2019s history of overlong showers. That produced some snickers, and Ryan\u2019s face went red. As wedding toasts go, though, my guy could\u2019ve gotten more severely roasted.\n        We had picked several people to make toasts: Marcel, Ryan\u2019s sister Jessica, and our mutual couple friends, Marcus and Sam, as a comedy duo. We wanted to keep things funny and heartfelt, and they all stayed more or less in line with what we\u2019d told them. Unfortunately, our hired DJ and MC went off-script in his announcement after we thought the toasts were over.\n        \u201cAnd now, if any other friends and family would like to offer a few brief words of blessing to the happy couple, you can come on up to the mic.\u201d \n        I witnessed my new spouse turn an even deeper red when he saw his mother get up and stride, only partly steadily, towards the mic. She held a half-consumed glass of chardonnay in one hand. The DJ handed her the device, which she took in the other. My new mother-in-law paused for a moment, fumbling, while an ear-piercing whine echoed through the spacious banquet hall. Cheryl turned towards the crowd, took a couple of steps, and the sound of the screeching hot mic halted as suddenly as it had jolted all of us to attention,\n        Cheryl began, \u201cSorry about that\u2026\u201d But she held the mic too far away, and only the front tables could hear her.\n        The DJ gestured to her to get the mic closer, but the move came across as pretty obscene, truth be told. It looked like, um, he was doing a job of a sort, on an imaginary microphone or other, um, similarly shaped object. His signaling worked, though, because we all heard loud and clear when Cheryl bellowed into the microphone in response.\n        \u201cYoung man!\u201d The room reverberated. \u201cYoung man, you stop that disgusting display right now!\u201d\n        I felt Ryan sink into his chair next to me. Cheryl continued.\n        \u201cUgh. Revolting!\u201d She cast one more withering glare at the DJ. Then she turned toward us. I elbowed Ryan to sit up, and he righted himself in time for us to face our doom.\n        \u201cYou kids! You\u2019re so cute, but I don\u2019t see why you had to go and make a new name when you had a perfectly good one.\u201d\n        I could feel the cringe spread through the room as my mother-in-law went on a tirade about how no one respects tradition anymore.\n        \u201c... but you two are planning to have kids, right?\u201d It was my turn to feel my face flush as she directed her commentary toward me. She pointed towards me and looked out at the crowd, now riveted by her performance.\n        \u201cAnd I guess you people know that she\u2019ll have to take some cooking lessons. This girl has one cookbook to her name, and it\u2019s a 50s Betsy Chowder! Can you imagine? I suppose you\u2019ll be making my son some kind of weird dessert chowder or\u2026\u201d She made a fake gagging motion. \u201cPickle Chowder! Are you going to make him pickle chowder? I heard that\u2019s a real recipe in the book.\u201d Her indignation was unmissable.\n        The DJ tried to approach Cheryl and gently take the microphone from her hand. My mother-in-law stumbled backwards as he neared. She hollered into the microphone, which happened to still be in front of her face.\n        \u201cYou stay away from me, you pervert!\u201d\n        She took another clumsy step and bumped into a stand that looked like a marble column. It must\u2019ve been made of fiberglass, though, because it tipped over with astonishing ease. It held a flower arrangement that had been the backdrop to our ceremony, but the glass sculptural vase shattered when it hit the parquet floor. I watched it all, almost mesmerized, and the seconds stretched out as if the whole thing were playing out in slow motion.\n        Cheryl managed to grab onto the nearby mantelpiece and didn\u2019t fall. We were relieved only for a moment, though, because her tirade continued. The DJ had backed away. Miraculously, the wine had mostly stayed in her glass, which she still gripped.\n        \u201cWho even eats chowder anymore? It\u2019s so thick and gloopy.\u201d She laughed almost girlishly. \u201cGloopy. Gloopy. Gloopy.\u201d She repeated it in different intonations. \u201cIs that even a word?\u201d\n        Ryan made an attempt to get up, but the caterers had set up the bride and groom\u2019s table so close to the wall that he bumped the awkwardly placed table legs as he tried. \n        \u201cOww!\u201d Ryan hobbled away from the table, grabbing his right knee. He moved to stand upright.\n        \u201cWait a minute! I have some more to say here!\u201d Cheryl downed half of the wine still in her glass and set it down on the mantelpiece with what sounded like excessive force. Her eyes went narrow as she turned to the group again. Ryan advanced slowly toward her.\n        \u201cCan you believe it? Chowder! CHOWDER!\u201d Her voice thundered. \u201cCHOWDER IS THE MOST DISGUSTING SUBSTANCE EVER CREATED! YOU WILL NOT FEED MY SON CHOWDER!\u201d\n        \u201cMom? Mom. Hey, can I have this?\u201d Ryan reached for the mic, but my mother-in-law swiped her hand away a little too hard, releasing the microphone at the apex of the motion. The device flew across the echoey space, and once again everything around me seemed to unfold in slow motion. The mic traveled in a perfect parabola, its trajectory clear. No one stirred to stop it. I\u2019m not even sure anyone could\u2019ve. In stunned silence, we collectively witnessed the mic arc the room gracefully. As one, we gasped when it became clear where the device would make its crash landing.\n        The short flight ended with the mic jutting, almost mockingly, from the second layer of our gorgeous, custom wedding cake with pearlized doodads. The once-pristine basket weave pattern in buttercream, now marred by an errant microphone.\n        Cheryl appeared unaffected by the fact that she had just impaled our cake. She simply dismissed herself back to her seat at the main family table. The wedding had come to a screeching halt, and my mother-in-law didn\u2019t seem to notice that anything was amiss. I sat aghast as I watched her sit down and dig through her purse, produce one of her signature Chazel lipsticks, and proceed to apply it flawlessly despite her compromised state.\n        The DJ, in a clear attempt to re-establish some semblance of professionalism, rummaged through a black backpack. He pulled out a second mic, fumbling for a moment with a battery pack. The speakers whined in protest, but he managed to get the backup working.\n        \u201cSo, uh, would anybody else like to come up and toast the happy couple?\u201d He paused. \u201cOr express any other opinions about chowder?\u201d\n        The pause hung in the air, until finally the crowd roared in laughter. The DJ started up the music again. A caterer deftly extracted the microphone from the cake, and we are married now. Cheryl had partly sobered up with some coffee by the time we did our staged sparkler exit and was appalled to realize what she had done to our cake.\n        Nowadays, if my mother-in-law tries to give me any grief about my non-traditional choices, all I have to do is say \u201cchowder.\u201d She blanches, and the subject changes immediately. Thanks for the assist, Betsy!\n"}

There\u2019s a reason you were selected for this event, and it\u2019s not just because you successfully resolved several factional disputes within the Human Continuum, set up trade routes with the N\u2019rith to exchange new and tasty protein supplies with our neighbors who look distressingly like velociraptors, or established scientific exchange with the Khasa, who unfortunately look a great deal like domesticated cats from Earth in mech suits.\u201d Darby ticked off each point on the fingers of her gloved left hand.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Arkhaven. They like us, but they also found us first when humanity was exploring local space. We thought they were unusual rocks. Which technically they are, given that they\u2019re also sentient.\u201d Mellis tugged their tunic into place. \u201cIt\u2019s nerves, honestly. Usually I\u2019m only dealing with one species at a time, and here I\u2019ve got three others to juggle.\u201d\n        \u201cYour implants have all the relevant social customs loaded, and whatever they look like, they\u2019re here for the same purpose.\u201d Attach\u00e9 Darby gently shoved Mellis\u2019 hands down. \u201cDon\u2019t tug, you\u2019ll mess up all my work.\u201d\n        \u201cThe Treaty of Ediskar.\u201d Mellis exhaled slowly. \u201cNamed for the wholly unremarkable star system currently hosting all of us, useful because it\u2019s a nexus point for all of our jump-gates and because it\u2019s relatively close to the borders of each of our powers.\u201d They smiled at Darby. \u201cThank you. I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n        Darby smiled back. \u201cRelax, what could go wrong?\u201d\n        And for the first few hours (by Mellis\u2019 chrono), things went reasonably well. They were introduced to the diplomatic teams from the other three species and introductions were cordial as each species had adapted their usual modes of greeting for the event. Shortly after that, Mellis found themself part of a small group of the lead diplomats of the N\u2019rith, Khasa, and Arkhaven.\n        Shale was the Arkhaven diplomat. Zie had elected to use human neo-pronouns out of courtesy, given that zir species didn\u2019t really have genders. Shale had been part of the expeditionary force that first encountered humans, it turned out, and had a number of amusing stories about that meeting.\n        The Khasa chief diplomat, Hss\u2019ktch, was probably chosen because she was the most polite Khasa Mellis had ever encountered. Not once did she refer to humans as \u201csoft-toothed clawless bipeds,\u201d and occasionally complimented Mellis\u2019 technology. She was even good about the positioning of her mech suit so as not to literally step on toes.\n        But Railo was the real mystery. The N\u2019rith diplomat was dressed in an elegant dress that bore similarities to ball gowns of the human Edwardian era, though with a split in the fabric for her tail. She had clearly mastered the social graces currently in fashion in the Human Continuum, knew enough about technology to gain Hss\u2019ktch\u2019s grudging praise, and inquired after several of Shale\u2019s diplomatic team by name. But she wouldn\u2019t ever look at Mellis directly, even though both their species had grown out of considering direct eye-contact as a challenge.\n        Railo\u2019s giving all the human signs of embarrassment, Darby murmured non-audibly through Mellis\u2019 comm implant, even though her species signals that quite differently.\n        I noticed that. I wonder if I\u2019ve said something awkward? Mellis\u2019 response went directly through her implant, while she discussed the state of human affairs now that the Jovian colonies had achieved their independence from the Far Odyssey Corporation.\n        Hss\u2019ktch yowled something that her translator conveyed as, \u201cGood. Cubs need independence from overbearing and controlling parents.\u201d\n        Meanwhile, Darby sent back a negative. I\u2019ve triple checked your verbal and non-verbal communication, and there\u2019s nothing that cross-references with our data for the N\u2019rith as potentially offensive or awkward.\n        Shale, of course, knew human Tradespeak. \u201cFrom what I have been told, the colonists were fully adapted for their environments?\u201d\n        Mellis gestured agreement. \u201cThat was part of the issue. Far Odyssey was trying to enforce rules based on Earth standards, while the colonies simply couldn\u2019t follow them.\u201d\n        Hss\u2019ktch made another series of vocalizations that translated as, \u201cPack too far and too different. Parents need to relinquish control.\u201d\n        Clearly Rialo could follow the conversations easily enough. She signaled agreement at the right times, made appropriate sounds at appropriate places, and had even volunteered an observation earlier on. But beyond that, she had barely contributed to any conversation, instead focused on her bowl of something that might have been offered as steak tartare in a human restaurant.\n        Darby, query our available databases for instances of N\u2019rith utilizing human behavior patterns. Something\u2019s off here, and she has to know what she\u2019s doing. The question is, why? Mellis included indicators for concern with her message.\n        On it, First Diplomat. Darby\u2019s response was flavored with markers for thoughtful assent.\n        Meanwhile, Hss\u2019ktch was sharing a story about a similar event with her people, where a group of Khasa had splintered from a collective due to mistreatment by their elders. Which was a reasonable thing, Hss\u2019ktch argued; the elders demanded behaviors that went against the nature of that group, and rather than submit or fight, they left. \u201cSplintering now accepted as reasonable. As long as pack can sustain itself and not harm other packs or collectives, elders now see wisdom in difference. Now Pack-That-Breeds-Not is healthy and harmonious collective.\u201d \n        Secondary query, Darby. Pack-That-Breeds-Not, Khasa collective, please? It\u2019s not a term I\u2019ve heard used before.\n        And then Rialo spoke for the first time in nearly half an hour. \u201cWe N\u2019rith have had, since the time of first consciousness, awareness that some are not suited for making eggs, but are suitable for protecting or rearing them.\u201d\n        Hss\u2019ktch\u2019s yowls translated into an amused chuckle. \u201cSo said Pack-That-Breeds-Not. Sufficient Khasa spawn enough litters, no need for all to do a thing that brings some distress.\u201d\n        Match found on Pack-That-Breeds-Not, Darby sent. Our xenoanthropologists compare that group to asexual humans and those whose attraction could not result in children, though with an understanding that it\u2019s the closest approximation between species. Confirming that N\u2019rith have a history of that as well, though we don\u2019t know if their species ever had a splintering like the Khasa.\n        Nothing on the N\u2019rith utilizing human behaviors, though?\n        Not yet, First Diplomat.\n        Mellis said, \u201cHuman history is a bit more complex around acceptance of those who had no interest in matches to produce offspring. We\u2019re better now, but can always be better.\u201d\n        Hss\u2019ktch rumble-purred with a few hisses, which came out as, \u201cOne can always be better about how one treats the different. Is why Khasa wish to work with you, you pursue being better almost as diligently as we.\u201d\n        Did we just get a compliment from her? \n        Verifying, Darby responded, followed with markers for cheering and, Yeah, we just did. Chalk one up for Team Humanity.\n        Shale chuckled, a sound like boulders slowly colliding. \u201cWe have our own history of difference, but we learn much from you, whose biology requires propagation in that way.\u201d\n        \u201cThis is why we\u2019re here, though,\u201d Mellis said smoothly, \u201cbecause we have a great deal to offer each other.\u201d They indicated amusement to the surrounding non-humans, and added, \u201cTo bring this around to our business here, though I enjoy your company distinct from our work together.\u201d\n        At that, Rialo\u2019s tail quickly whipped around her clawed feet. Hss\u2019ktch clearly noticed, but didn\u2019t say anything, while Shale either didn\u2019t notice or pretended not to notice.\n        Oh damn, that was N\u2019rith embarrassment. What the hell did I say, Darby?\n        Milliseconds passed, and Darby responded, Nothing problematic according to our catalog. Her reaction started as soon as she parsed you expressing enjoyment of the company, though.\n        That\u2019s\u2026 kind of weird, honestly. The N\u2019rith are social sentients, much like the rest of us, and while they have members of their species who could be classed as introverts by human standards, Rialo hasn\u2019t \u2013 wait. Cross-check her reactions to me. This might be a me thing, though if she didn\u2019t like me, she\u2019d have said something.\n        The N\u2019rith are very direct most of the time, Darby agreed.\n        After a moment of slightly awkward silence after Rialo\u2019s action, Shale signaled agreement. \u201cYou are all fascinating to be around, and I find myself appreciating the company.\u201d Rialo, her tail still wrapped around her feet, also signaled agreement, but without any other markers of embarrassment. \n        Hss\u2019ktch added, \u201cWhile you are not my pack, I experience a similar sensation of comfort in your presence.\u201d After she chuckle-purred, her translator added,        \u201cDespite your bipedal, furless nature.\u201d From the tone, this was clearly meant as humor, and Mellis found themself chuckling in acknowledgement.\n        Only to see Rialo\u2019s tail wrap tighter.\n        Okay, it is me, but why? Darby? Any pings at all from our databases?\n        Nothing solid. Mellis was sure that Darby would have said more, but suddenly Rialo interrupted.\n        \u201cMay I touch your hair or skin?\u201d Her tail by now had coiled so thoroughly around her feet that if she tried to move, she\u2019d simply fall flat.\n        Hss\u2019ktch looked\u2026 not irritated, but resigned. Shale\u2019s face, normally quite mobile, had gone very still.\n        \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d Mellis inquired as neutrally as they could.\n        \u201cYou humans. You are soft.\u201d Rialo looked desperately embarrassed, both in N\u2019rith and in human body language. \u201cOur world has nothing like you. Even our plants must be treated to produce fibers that do not scratch or burrow into our hides. But we,\u201d here, her eyes flicked up to Mellis, and her second eyelid closed and opened slowly, \u201cwe find that softness is something that generates tactile pleasure. We confine ourselves to clothing, but some among us are curious as to the feel of human softness.\u201d Before anyone could respond, she said in a piping wail, \u201cOh, I shall be separated from my duties and my clutch for admitting such a thing!\u201d\n        And that\u2019s the answer, Darby.\n        Already adding it to the database, but filed under protected information. We\u2019re not going to use this to cause harm. Diplomatic protocol included contingencies for situations involving cross-species embarrassment.\n        Aloud, Mellis said, \u201cWith the understanding that you are simply, shall we say, curious about our physical differences, I consent.\u201d At least here her experiences with the N\u2019rith paid off; while most of their communication was astoundingly direct, delicate social issues were frequently handled with tact.\n        Carefully, Rialo extended a clawed hand, and brushed Mellis\u2019 skin carefully. With a tone in her voice that Mellis\u2019 implant translated as honest relief, she said, \u201cFor scientific curiosity, then.\u201d\n        The moment passed when Hss\u2019ktch vocalized, \u201cYou bipeds are very strange.\u201d\n"}

She was wearing the familiar crimson robes over her stained gray sweat suit. Her head was freshly shaved. Rosalie took in Dr. Diaz\u2019s wide-eyed expression just as Springflower reached their table and threw her arms around Rosalie.\n        \u201cSpringflower! What are you doing here?\u201d Rosalie asked.\n        \u201cI have taken leave of the mother-home to continue my education and share the good word! It fills my heart to see you again!

Rosalie could feel dozens of eyes on her.\n        \u201cSpringflower, let me introduce you to Dr. Diaz,\u201d Rosalie said as she gently attempted to disentangle herself from the tight hug.\n        \u201cLovely to meet you, Dr. Diaz!\u201d Springflower said, far too loudly.

Did you hear that Reverend Rainbow Moonshine won the blindfolded river race?\u201d\n        \u201cGood for the Rev,\u201d Rosalie said with an awkward smile.\n        \u201cShe almost beat your record, but don\u2019t worry! She just missed it. We did have to let Fungi Crystalrain take over your job as primal scream cantor, but she doesn\u2019t quite have your pitch. You used to awaken the powers of the great ones with your cries,\u201d Springflower said joyfully.\n         \u201cSpringflower, I really want to catch up, but I was just about to tell Dr. Diaz about my research.

It was time to get ready for the big party where all the elitists would be in attendance. There they would render their support and checkbooks to the most innovative businesses that would definitely make a return on their investment. Lamar was putting the finishing touches on his proposal. An all-too-familiar feeling of distress came to him as he thought about revealing himself completely. After all, his most embarrassing secret was the inspiration for this very innovative idea. \n        Lamar got himself together, but before walking out of the door, he looked in the mirror to hype himself up. \u201cToday is the day, you shall succeed, stop hiding in the shadows. Let the people see you for who you truly are.\u201d  {1}\n        Just as he opened the door, he took a deep breath, only for the foulest of sights and smells to remind him of his current situation. He lived across from a garbage disposal site. However, he didn\u2019t let this circumstance stop him from dreaming big.\n        At the Pillard Hotel, Lamar arrived early so that he could see who would be in attendance as they all walked through the ballroom doors. He tried to blend in with the crowd, but that was harder than he realized because the security was keeping a close eye on him.  Lamar decided to make his way to the restroom in order to be out of sight for a little while. He would return when the announcements began. Nearing the bathroom, he saw the manager of the hotel. Lamar quickly changed his route to avoid encountering him.\n        Lamar heard his name being called to present his innovative idea. He went back into the ballroom. At the back of the stage, he took a deep breath and whispered to himself, \u201cyou can do this.\u201d Going out onto the stage, Lamar caught a bit of stage fright, but promptly shook it off and began his presentation.\n        \u201cHello, my name is Lamar Jessup. I have created a one-of-a-kind spray that will envelop you in your own personal atmosphere. Ever walked past something that turned your stomach upside down with its atrocious smell? Well, with this spray, you won\u2019t have to worry about that. Let me demonstrate.\u201d \n        Lamar pulled a skunk from under the table he was using to present. The attendees gasped and muttered their disapproval. Lamar sprayed the area around the skunk that was preparing to show its own displeasure by lifting its tail and readying to spray its deterring scent. \n        As it did, the manager of the hotel came into the ballroom and saw Lamar on the stage. With determined steps, the manager approached the stage with his brows knitted together in anger as he yelled at Lamar.\n        \u201cLamar, what on earth are you doing? Your shift started an hour ago! Get your garbage smelling behind in the kitchen where you belong.\u201d As the manager reached the stage to drag Lamar off of it, the skunk let loose its deterring spray right at the manager\u2019s feet, but to his and the audience\u2019s surprise there was no smell. Once realization kicked in for everyone in the audience, they all stood in a round of applause for Lamar. \n        As the audience stopped clapping, Lamar spoke up and said, \u201cYes, I am no businessman, and yes, I often smell like garbage. I live in one of the dirtiest of places, across from a garbage disposal site. But, what I have brought to you today proves that our circumstances don\u2019t determine our worth.\u201d Stunned, the manager moved to the side as the richest elitist there walked up to the stage, Gwendolyn Pillard, who was the owner of the hotel and many enterprises around the world. \n        \u201cYou said your name was Lamar, right? Well, I am interested in sponsoring your new business venture with this wondrous invention. Can you please tell me more about your unconventional story? By the way, what is it called?\u201d Lamar stood there flabbergasted, unable to speak, and the manager\u2019s knitted brows parted in astonishment. \n        Gwendolyn patiently waited for Lamar to come back to reality as she smiled at his shocked face. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of where you come from, boy. We don\u2019t all get to live the lavish lives that we want. Some of us have to work for it. Not many people know this, but I too once grew up across from a not-so-pleasant place, a fish factory. Everything in our home smelled of fish, and everywhere we went that\u2019s the smell that followed us until I was determined to make a change. I worked hard and finally saved up enough money to turn that fish factory into this great enterprise here.\u201d Gwendolyn, a very thin middle-aged woman, ironically wearing a dress with images of fish on it, stood tall and confident, as she finished revealing her own embarrassing secret. \n        Finally, Lamar spoke, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Pillard. Yes, my name is Lamar Jessup, and I would be honored to present my business proposal to you and to tell you my story. This spray is called Mytmosphere.\u201d Lamar\u2019s worries and embarrassment of his secret being outed washed away after hearing what Gwendolyn said about her previous living conditions. This gave him even more confidence and determination to accomplish his goal of finally making something of himself. \n        The next day, Lamar met Gwendolyn on the top floor of the hotel in her private suite, where they discussed plans to build a factory to produce more of his invention. In less than three months, what they had already produced was flying off the shelves, with more people all around the world wanting to order Mytmosphere. \n        Even with his success, Lamar still stayed humbled and continued to live in his house across the street from the garbage disposal site as a reminder to never forget where you came from. \n"}

Hitting the cha-cha slide, drinking fruit punch and soda; we lived for nights like these. This was the freshman homecoming dance. What a night it was shaping up to be.\n        It was after I inhaled my third slice of pepperoni that Penelope approached me. I found it unexpected because I never talked to Penelope in class, but when in Rome, I suppose. We shared a slow dance at arm\u2019s length but just before I was going to twirl her around, we were untimely interrupted by a tap on my shoulder.\n        I turned around and blindly said, \u201cThere was room for Jesus, I swear!\u201d I was surprised to find that I was not talking to a teacher on chaperoning duty. Instead, I looked into my mother\u2019s eyes. An overwhelming fear took hold of me. What on Earth was Mom doing here?\n        As she spoke, my heart sank. \u201cHi sugarplum. You left a couple of things at home, so I figured I\u2019d bring them by.\u201d With every item she listed, my forehead grew sweatier. \u201cYour inhaler, your lucky suspenders, your new bow tie from Grandma, your glasses, and most importantly, a kiss from your mommy!\u201d\n        She leaned in for her signature Mom-smooch. I recoiled, all too aware of the growing, unwanted attention from everyone on the dance floor. Despite arching my back and craning my neck uncomfortably, Mom was persistent. I managed to turn my face sideways and get away with a quick cheek peck, but I could already imagine the never-ending jabs from my friends for this.\n        In the middle of the basketball-court-turned-dance-floor, I stood holding my inhaler, my lucky suspenders, my new bow tie from Grandma and my glasses, watching Mom finally walk away. I turned back to Penelope, who I could assume no longer wanted to dance.\n        She chuckled lightly, but not in a mean way. Then she said, \u201cThat was kind of cute.\u201d I could barely believe I heard the words correctly. \n        Over my shoulder, a blood-curdling word pierced through the air, \u201cSugarplum!\u201d What did I do to deserve such torture? Just when I thought I had escaped, she returned! \n        For some unknown reason, she spoke louder this time. Or, maybe the music was quieter. Either way, more people were listening. \u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Mom said, \u201cYou left a love letter that you wrote!\u201d My mind went numb. She continued, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to want to give it to this lovely young lady you were dancing with.\u201d\n        I tried to save face as best I could. \u201cLove letter? Nope! Not mine! Couldn\u2019t be!\u201d\n        She was not going to be convinced that easily. \u201cThen why is it in your handwriting? And it\u2019s talking about the freshman homecoming dance and how you want to be with Kelsey.\u201d She spoke to Penelope directly for this next line, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you are Kelsey. He\u2019s got a real crush on you. Here, read the letter.\u201d\n        Mom extended the ripped-out paper from my diary toward Penelope. I lunged forward and intercepted the handoff. Without a second thought, I wadded the paper up, stuffed it in my mouth, chewed as fast as I could manage, and by some miracle, I swallowed it. \n        At this point, I realized everyone at the dance, chaperones included, had paused what they were doing to watch and see how this all played out. The whole freshman class saw the spectacle. Penelope looked at me like I was an alien. My friends howled at my misfortune. I even caught a glimpse of Kelsey ducking for cover in the crowd.\n        t was going to be a rough few weeks for me after this debacle. I sighed, then looked at Mom. \u201cDrive me home. I\u2019m done.\u201d\n        She stayed behind me for a moment and called out, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sugarplum? Did I say something?\u201d Then she followed me in tow, \u201cEverything alright?\u201d \n        Everything was not alright at that very moment. I was the laughingstock of the school.\n        Sure, there will be another homecoming dance. Not another freshman one, but who cares? That was going to be the lamest one out of them all anyway. On the bright side, I had my first slow dance with someone that was not Mom or Grandma. And the school ordered stuffed-crust pizza, which is my favorite. I grabbed a fourth slice on my way out. At times like these, you just have to take the wins with the losses. Plus, I needed something to wash that disgusting inky paper taste out of my mouth.\n        Fingers crossed that Mom feels bad for me and lets me skip school on Monday.\n"}

He poured the milk over his Sugar Blasted Cocoa Bombs and slid the carton to his sister. Jason\u2019s mom slapped together a PB&J and tossed it on top of the cheese doodles and snack cake in Jason\u2019s Garfield lunch box. She rushed to get herself and everyone in the house ready for the day. His dad leisurely flipped through the local newspaper.\n        \u201cI heard someone spotted Chris in a hippy van at a gas station in Abilene,\u201d said Jennifer, Jason\u2019s sister. She poured a glass of milk.\n        Chris Hainey was a star high school football player and in Jennifer\u2019s class. Jason only knew of Chris. He had hung out with his brother Shawn, who was one year ahead of him in sixth grade. Shawn had been noticeably absent from school since the incident. \n        Chris and Shawn had been on a family trip to the lake three weeks earlier. Shawn had been annoying his older brother, so Chris took the family\u2019s black lab on a hike. The dog returned to the campsite, but there was no trace of Chris. There had been an all out man hunt in the region. However, short of a few rumors that hadn\u2019t panned out, no information had turned up.\n        \u201cI want you both to come home right after school. I don\u2019t want you running around right now. And don\u2019t let anyone in, even friends,\u201d Mom said as she started to clean the kitchen.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t bother your uncle, either,\u201d Dad commanded from behind his newspaper.\n        \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jennifer said, rolling her eyes. \n        Their mom\u2019s brother Kenny had fallen on hard times. He had been working odd jobs in Shreveport, but could not find steady work. She offered to let him stay in their backyard workshop for a few weeks while he figured out his next steps.\n        Kenny kept pretty much to himself. He took off in the morning in his rundown wood-paneled station wagon. Maybe he was looking for work or up to something more sinister. No one ever asked him, and he certainly never volunteered information. Jason and Jennifer were a little creeped out by his disheveled appearance and dead eyes. Once a week, he would join the family for dinner. The kids would scarf down their pot roast or casserole so that they could be excused ASAP.\n        Jason biked home from school full-speed. It was a pretty good day at school. He had a substitute in history, which meant they got to watch a movie. During recess, he dominated in a game of kickball. In the afternoon, there was a \u201cstranger danger\u201d assembly.\n        His mom\u2019s instructions to come straight home echoed in his head. Surely she wouldn\u2019t mind if he made a quick stop at the convenience store. He cooked the last box of mac and cheese yesterday after school. Besides, he had seven dollars burning a hole in his pocket. \n        Jason pursued the aisles of the mini mart. Having selected a bubble gum soda and a pack of gummy bears, Jason made a beeline for the baseball cards. The bells on the door jingled. A plume of cigarette smoke entered the store before the patron. Jason let out a small gasp and ducked behind a magazine rack. \n        His uncle strode through the door in his stained white undershirt and faded jeans. A cigarette dangled from his lip. He winked and flashed a gap-tooth grin to the lady behind the counter. He headed right to the beer case and grabbed two six packs. \n        Jason carefully peeked around the corner. He didn\u2019t think his uncle would rat him out if he saw him. Heck, he probably wouldn\u2019t even recognize him. Nonetheless, he couldn\u2019t risk his mom finding out about his detour. He would never see the light of day again.\n        Kenny put the six-packs on the counter. \u201cTwo packs of Menthol Smooths,\u201d he mumbled.\n        The cashier rang up his purchase. He reached into his pocket and threw some cash on the counter. \u201cKeep the change,\u201d he said as he walked out the door.\n        He flung his cigarette on the ground and stomped it out with the pointed toe of his worn cowboy boot. He jumped in his car and peeled out of the parking lot. \n        The cashier counted the cash three times. \u201cThat jerk stiffed me two dollars!\u201d she shouted to no one in particular. It didn\u2019t matter. Kenny was long gone. \n        Jason paid for his haul and stuffed everything in his backpack. As he approached the high school football stadium, he saw a familiar car in the parking lot. Kenny perched on the hood of his station wagon. A group of four young people laughed and drank the six packs with Kenny. Jason put his head down and raced by. \n        When he got home, Jason flopped on the couch and took his soda and snacks out of his backpack.  He settled in to watch Brady Bunch reruns. \n        His parents arrived home. Dad shooed Jason off the couch and switched the TV to the nightly news. Jason shuffled down the hallway to his room. The cord from the phone in the kitchen stretched into Jennifer\u2019s bedroom. Jason looked in the slightly open door at Jennifer\u2019s walls plastered with posters. She sat at her desk, polishing her nails and gossiping to her friend about her other friends. \n        Mom called them for dinner. The phone rang immediately after she placed the headset in the cradle. She swiped the phone from her mom\u2019s reaching hand. \n        \u201cHello,\u201d she answered. \u201cOh, hey, Mrs. Wilson. Huh, uh, she isn\u2019t over here. Umm, yeah, she was in fifth period today. Yeah, I\u2019ll tell her if I see her. Bye.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Mom asked.\n        \u201cOh, Amanda hasn\u2019t made it home,\u201d Jennifer said nonchalantly. \n        Their mother looked worried. \n        \u201cShe totally ran off with Jack. Her mom couldn\u2019t reach him either. They\u2019re totally going to elope before graduation.\u201d \n        Jennifer continued to educate the family about how Jack is a dead beat and Amanda could do so much better. Jason pushed his spaghetti and meatballs around his plate with his fork. He didn\u2019t know Amanda or Jack, but he wondered if they were part of the group with Uncle Kenny today. \n        \u201cAre you ok, hon?\u201d Mom asked Jason. \u201cYou look kind of pale.\u201d\n        \u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m just tired. I think I\u2019m gonna lay down, okay?\u201d Jason replied.\n        Later in the evening, Jason\u2019s mom popped in to check on him. He pretended to be asleep. He felt uneasy, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. Maybe it was all the candy.\n        He heard the rattle of his uncle\u2019s station wagon pull up out front. A few minutes later, the back gate slammed. His parents\u2019 muffled voices carried down the hallway. Jason moved closer to the door. \n        \u201cHe\u2019s gotta go,\u201d his father said matter-of-factly. \n        \u201cWe don\u2019t know that Kenny\u2019s involved with any of this,\u201d she said, defending her brother. \n        \u201cC\u2019mon. Trouble follows him everywhere. You just think it\u2019s just a coincidence? Shreveport, Oklahoma City, here?\u201d \n        \u201cYes. Yes, I do. He\u2019s a good kid. Just a little mixed up.\u201d His mom\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cI promised my mother I would watch out for him.\u201d\n        \u201cThat was when he was fifteen years old. He\u2019s thirty-four. You have your own family now.\u201d His dad struggled to keep his voice down.\n        \u201cKenny\u2019s still my family.\u201d\n        \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to. Frankly, I don\u2019t wanna know. We have our own kids to watch out for. I don\u2019t want to get caught up in any plot he\u2019s hatched.\u201d I\u2019m going to talk to him.\u201d\n        The sliding door to the backyard squeaked open. Jason waited for the yelling, but it never came. It felt like hours passed as Jason sat with his ear pressed against the bedroom door. It was really only twenty minutes. The back gate crashed shut. Jason hurried to the window. Kenny opened the driver\u2019s door of his station wagon and threw a tattered duffle bag in the passenger seat. He slammed the door and tore off down the street. Headlights disappeared as he screeched around the corner. That was the last Jason saw of his uncle for almost forty years.\n\nApril 2022\n        Jason sat for several minutes in the driveway. He wanted to be with his mom when the news broke. Since his dad had passed last year, she seemed so fragile. He knew the news about her brother would be a devastating blow. \n        A detective for Shreveport PD had contacted Jason last July about a cold case he had reopened. The DNA evidence in a kidnapping investigation showed a 28% match with a DNA ancestry test Jason had submitted a few years back. The percentage was consistent with that of his uncle.\n        He cooperated fully with authorities. He didn't have much information on his uncle. After Kenny left, he lived off the grid for the most part. His mom would occasionally receive a letter, and Jason was able to direct the authorities' attention to a small town outside of Denver. \n        As the investigation closed in and an arrest was imminent, he asked the detective if he could let him know once Kenny was apprehended. He expected it to be a huge national news story, and he wanted to inform his mother before the media did.\n        His mother greeted him with a beaming smile. \u201cWhat are you doing here unannounced?\u201d\n        \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d He gave her a kiss on the cheek. \n        \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d she asked,\n        He shook his head. His mother joined him on the couch. The furniture was new. The wood paneling was painted. Nonetheless, he was somehow swept back to that night he sat with his ear pressed against his bedroom door.\n        \u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about Kenny,\u201d he said. \n        \u201cOh dear,\u201d she whispered. The color drained from her face. \n        Jason took her hand. \u201cNo, he\u2019s still-\u201d\n        \u201cThey caught him, didn\u2019t they?\u201d \n        \u201cWait. Wha-? How did you -\u201d Jason was speechless.\n        \u201cHe couldn\u2019t run forever. It was the Shreveport kidnapping documentary, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n        She clicked on the TV. A breaking news ticker crawled across the screen. \u201cColorado man arrested in connection with 1982 Louisiana kidnapping. Kenneth Butler is the primary suspect in twenty-two kidnappings dating back to 1978.\u201d  Jason\u2019s mother raised her hand to her mouth. She watched her handcuffed brother forced in the back of a police cruiser. \n        \u201cYou knew. You knew, clear back to when Dad kicked him out!\u201d Jason clenched his teeth.\n        \u201cHe was turning things around. He had a hard life. Your grandfather was so tough on him. And he had to drop out of school\u2026\u201d she trailed off. \u201cI promised to take care of him.\u201d Her voice cracked as it did that night in 1984. \n        \u201cTake care of HIM? What about us? You invited a predator into our home!\u201d \n        \u201cHe would never harm you. He would never harm family.\u201d\n        \u201cWhat about the other kids? The families he destroyed? He\u2019s a monster! You\u2019re a monster for helping him!\u201d Jason cried.\n        Jason\u2019s mother sobbed. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m so sorry. You must understand!\u201d\n        Jason turned his attention to the TV. The camera focused close-up on Kenny in the back of the police car. Kenny looked out the window. He grinned and winked at the camera. It was the same gap-toothed grin he gave the woman at the convenience store. \n        Rage filled his heart. He was furious at his mother and at himself too. Furious for convincing himself that Amanda and Jack weren\u2019t at the football stadium with Kenny and had eloped. Furious that he believed his mother\u2019s lies. Furious that he kept his mouth shut. \n        His mom made a half-hearted attempt to comfort him by touching his arm. He yanked it away and stormed out the door. He tore out of the driveway and down the street, just as Kenny did. Tires screeched around the corner.\n        Most of all, he was furious that he bore the burden of protecting his mother when she didn't protect him. \n\n\n\n"}

You can tell them apart because Jacob has a little freckle right above his lip.\u201d \n        \u201cAnd because I\u2019m always holding baby Jakey, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Bridget\u2019s uncle, Jake, cooed at the baby in his arms. \n        Cheryl rolled her eyes. \u201cName one baby after him, and suddenly he\u2019s grandpa of the year,\u201d she teased. \n        \u201cWhere are Daisy and Neal?\u201d Bridget asked, but before anyone could answer, the front door opened again, and Bridget heard her cousin\u2019s voice. \n        \u201cAre there two kidnapped babies in this house?\u201d she called out. \n        \u201cIn the kitchen!\u201d Cassie yelled back. \n        A few seconds later, Bridget\u2019s cousin, Daisy, and her husband, Neal, entered the rapidly-crowding kitchen. Neal bent down and hugged Bridget before turning to Cassie. \n        \u201cHow can I help?\u201d he asked. \n        Cassie kissed his cheek and waved him away. \u201cTake this adorable baby from me, so I can finish the cranberry sauce,\u201d she said, offering Jeffrey to his dad. \n        \u201cNope, sorry,\u201d Neal said, picking up the wooden spoon next to the stove. \u201cYou touched him last, he\u2019s yours.\u201d Cassie laughed and took a seat. \n        \u201cOkay, fine, you do the cranberry sauce,\u201d she said. \n        Daisy took a seat next to her aunt, popping a handful of trail mix in her mouth. \n        \u201cDaisy, help me peel these sweet potatoes for the casserole,\u201d Bridget said, rolling a couple of sweet potatoes toward her cousin. \n        \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Daisy replied, rolling them back. Bridget rolled her eyes, but said nothing. \n        \u201cHere, Daisy, take Jacob, so I can go help Uncle Dave with the turkey,\u201d Jake said, holding Jeffrey toward her. \n        \u201cCan\u2019t you just take him with you?\u201d Daisy asked, standing up and stretching. \n        \u201cOf course, darling,\u201d her dad said, kissing the top of her head. \u201cYou look tired. Why don\u2019t you go take a nap?\"\n        \u201cI think I will,\u201d Daisy said, yawning. \n        Bridget sighed loudly. \u201cA nap? While the rest of us are preparing dinner?\u201d she asked, not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t be such a brat, Bridget,\u201d Daisy said as she exited the kitchen. \n        Neal apologized for Daisy. \u201cShe\u2019s just exhausted. The twins wear her out,\u201d he explained. \n        Bridget rolled her eyes. Neal was always blinded by Daisy and refused to see how selfish and self-centered his wife was. She finished peeling the sweet potatoes and set to work chopping them up.\n        \u201cWhen is Brendon getting here?\u201d Bridget asked. She hadn\u2019t seen her baby brother since the Fourth of July, and she was eager to meet his new puppy, Goldie. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d her mom replied. \n        Ten minutes later, Bridget heard a loud bark in the front yard. \u201cBrendon\u2019s here!\u201d she yelled excitedly, jumping up from the table and rushing to the door. \n        She yanked it open and was met with the amusing sight of her scrawny little brother trying to wrangle an oversized puppy up onto the porch. When Brendon saw her watching, he burst into laughter. \n        \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, help me!\u201d he panted, yanking on Goldie\u2019s leash. Bridget took the leash from her brother\u2019s hand and hauled Goldie up the steps. She bent down to scratch Goldie behind the ears. \n        \u201cWho all is here?\u201d Brendon asked, once he was able to catch his breath. \n        \u201cWell, perfect little Daisy and her perfect little family, of course,\u201d Bridget answered. \n        Brendon grimaced. \u201cYikes. Drama already?\u201d he asked. \n        Bridget filled him in on Daisy\u2019s lack of assistance with dinner or her own children, and everyone excusing her bad behavior \u201cas usual,\u201d Bridget finished.\n        Brendon patted her on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s just one meal, one day. And then you don\u2019t have to see her again until next November.\u201d Bridget nodded and then followed her brother into the house. \n        \u201cGet that dog out of here!\u201d their mom screeched, swatting at Goldie, who was investigating the mashed potatoes on the counter. \n        Bridget pulled Goldie out of the kitchen and through the house. She opened the back door, unhooking Goldie\u2019s leash and setting her free. \n        \u201cDad! Goldie\u2019s out here! Keep the gate shut!\u201d she hollered before closing the door. \n        \u201cHey! Could you be quieter? I\u2019m trying to sleep!\u201d Daisy grumbled from the couch. \n        Bridget rolled her eyes so hard she thought they might pop. \n        \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said to Daisy. \n        After what felt like forever, dinner was finally ready. \n        No thanks to Daisy, Bridget thought bitterly. Bridget admonished herself. She knew she was being bratty, but she was so sick of the entire family tiptoeing around Daisy and acting like she was this perfect human. Every Thanksgiving it was the same. Bridget worked tirelessly to prepare the meal and clean up the house while Daisy lounged around being waited on. And it was even worse this year, because she had just had the babies, so everyone had to be even nicer to her! It was aggravating. \n        The family crowded around the table, piling their plates with turkey, stuffing, and potatoes. \n        \u201cNeal, honey, can you get me a soda?\u201d Daisy asked, scooping a bite of green bean casserole into her mouth. \n        \u201cOf course,\u201d Neal replied. He handed Jeffrey to Cheryl and went into the kitchen. \n        \u201cDaisy, can you hold Jeff?\u201d Cheryl asked, offering the baby to her daughter. \n        \u201cMom, I\u2019m eating,\u201d Daisy replied, not reaching for her baby. \n        \"Here, Aunt Cheryl, hand him to me,\u201d Bridget offered, scooping the baby up and holding him close. \u201cI can eat later, I\u2019m still hot from cooking anyway,\u201d she said, with a pointed look at Daisy.\n        Daisy didn\u2019t notice, though, as she took a sip of her soda and said, \u201cOh, Neal, it isn\u2019t cold enough. Can you put it in a glass with ice?\u201d\n        \u201cGeez, Daisy, can\u2019t you do anything for yourself?\u201d Bridget finally snapped. \n        \u201cMind your own business, Bridget,\u201d Daisy retorted. \u201cI was talking to my husband. You wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, since you can\u2019t make a relationship last more than six months.\u201d \n        Bridget snorted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you lecturing me on relationships?\u201d \n        \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Bridget, I don\u2019t mind getting her some ice. She gave me two beautiful baby boys, after all,\u201d Neal said, bending down to kiss Daisy on the top of her head. \n        \u201cWell, she had to, after lying about that miscarriage,\u201d Bridget mumbled under her breath. \n        \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014what did you just say?\u201d Daisy asked, daring Bridget to speak up. \n        Bridget cleared her throat and spoke loudly and clearly, \u201cI said you had to give him \u2018two beautiful baby boys\u2019 after you lied to him about having a miscarriage.\u201d \n        Everyone at the table stopped talking, each of them looking back and forth between Daisy and Bridget with a combination of shock, confusion, and curiosity. \n        \u201cDaisy, sweetie, what is Bridget talking about?\u201d Cheryl asked hesitantly. \n        \u201cNothing. She\u2019s a liar. You know she\u2019s always been jealous of me,\u201d Daisy replied. She reached out and yanked Jeffrey from Bridget\u2019s arms, holding him close and rocking him side to side. \n        \u201cI\u2019m a liar?\u201d Bridget asked incredulously. \u201cYou lied to Neal for years\u2014hell, you\u2019re still lying to him! You were never pregnant in high school. You lied to him about it so that he would turn down the scholarship at Southland University and go to Bridemont, closer to home. And, once it was too late for him to change schools, you told him you had miscarried.\u201d\n        \u201cWhy are you bringing this up now?\u201d Daisy asked, her voice rising. \u201cI told you that in confidence, and we were kids! I was going to tell Neal eventually!\u201d \n        Bridget shrugged, looking around for support from someone, anyone, but everyone just stared back at her in disbelief. \n        Neal stood behind Daisy, his hands gripping the back of her chair. \u201cHow could you say something like that?\u201d he asked, his voice a whisper. \n        Bridget looked at Neal, at once realizing that, in hurting Daisy, she had hurt Neal, too. And Neal didn\u2019t deserve that. He was a nice guy\u2014way too good for Daisy. Bridget stood up and took a step towards him, but Neal backed away. \n        \u201cDaisy, could we talk in the other room, please?\u201d Neal asked quietly. \n        Daisy and Neal left the room, and Bridget was left to deal with the rest of the family. \n        \u201cBridget, that was an awful thing to do,\u201d her aunt said, her voice barely audible. \n        \u201cAunt Cheryl, Uncle Jake... I\u2019m sorry. I know that wasn\u2019t the best way to do that. But she\u2019s been lying to all of you for over a decade. And I\u2019m so sick of it! I\u2019m tired of everyone acting like Daisy is perfect and above reproach when she\u2019s done one of the most reproachful things!\u201d Tears streamed down Bridget\u2019s face. \n        Her mom reached over and patted her arm. \u201cOkay, but do you think that was the best way to go about it? I think you owe Daisy and Neal an apology, Bridge.\u201d \n        Bridget sniffled, nodding. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry everyone. Once they finish talking, I\u2019ll apologize to both of them.\u201d \n        The family finished their meal in silence, with only the occasional sounds of chewing and swallowing. Although they tried not to listen to Daisy and Neal\u2019s conversation, it was hard to ignore. \n        \u201cDaisy, how could you lie to me like that?\u201d they heard Neal ask. Daisy\u2019s response was too low to pick up, but then they heard Neal\u2019s voice again as he said, \u201cWe could\u2019ve made it work. We loved each other, you being pregnant or not pregnant wasn\u2019t going to change that!\u201d Then, silence. They could hear Daisy sniffling, and then, several minutes later, they reentered the room. \n        \u201cAunt Cassie, Uncle Dave, thank you for having us. We are going to take the boys home now.\u201d\n        \u201cOh, Daisy, please don\u2019t leave,\u201d Bridget pleaded. \u201cI know I screwed up, and I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s Thanksgiving!\u201d Tears were streaming down her face yet again. \n        Daisy stiffened. \u201cMom, Dad, we will see you for dinner next week. Happy holidays, all.\u201d \n        Neal finished gathering the boys\u2019 diaper bag and toys, took Jacob from Jake\u2019s arms, and silently followed Daisy out of the house. \n        \u201cI promise I\u2019ll make it right,\u201d Bridget said, looking appropriately abashed. \n        \u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d her mom replied tersely, standing up to clear the table.\n        The following week, Bridget tried calling Daisy at least once a day, but to no avail. She sent emails, texts, even a floral bouquet, but it seemed as though her cousin was ready to hold this grudge just as long as Bridget had held her secret. \n        Finally, feeling like she had run out of options, Bridget reached out to Neal. \n        \u201cPlease don\u2019t hang up,\u201d she said when Neal answered the phone. \n        He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hang up, Bridget. What do you want?\u201d \n        \u201cI want to apologize. I never should have said anything, especially not in front of the entire family. It was so out of line, and I am deeply sorry. Please tell me that you and Daisy are okay? I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I broke up your family.\u201d \n        Neal was silent for a minute. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business or that I owe you anything, but yes, Daisy and I are okay. We have started counseling, and we are working through it. Despite the ugliness you exposed at Thanksgiving, I love Daisy. I\u2019ve loved her since we were sixteen.\u201d \n        Bridget thanked Neal for speaking to her, and before they hung up, she said, \u201cJust one more thing... Do you think Daisy will ever forgive me?\u201d \n        \u201cHonestly, Bridget? Only time will tell. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d And with that, Neal ended the call, and Bridget was left to figure out how to show Daisy how truly sorry she was."}

Well, not just pecan pie, but also spiced pecans, roasted pecans, barbecued pecans, pecan logs, pecan sandies, and pecan-cracking accessories. Our glorious ancestors built their financial wealth on sixty acres of gorgeous pecan orchards passed down through the generations. From 1807, when Abraham Fullerton planted his first pecan tree, to today, family members gather here each year. For the last fifty years or so, we all met for an annual Thanksgiving celebration at the homeplace currently owned by our 98-year-old matriarch, Florence Fullerton, known to the family affectionately as Memaw.\n        As I walked alone down the oak-laden pathway to the front door of the white columned mansion, built in 1874 on the edge of the farm, I held a secret in my heart and a piping-hot sweet potato casserole in my hands. Today, that secret would be unleashed, and I would lay bare the soul of this sinful family.\n        At least a dozen members of the family clan had gathered on this occasion, though a few faces were missing. Uncle Beauregard was still in New Mexico, working his magic at the annual nutcracker trade show. The Christmas season was already in full swing, and our company, Fullerton\u2019s Pecans, liked to stay ahead of the curve on the latest in cracking technology. The boys in Los Alamos (technically twenty-nine miles north of Los Alamos in the town of Espanola at an agricultural laboratory) had been developing some groundbreaking new crackers that used lasers. \n        As I entered the mansion, Uncle Beauregard\u2019s wife, Aunt Suellen met me at the door. I had learned weeks ago that while Uncle Beauregard made his long trips away from home to conduct business, Aunt Suellen was conducting a little business of her own. I had seen her in a sultry embrace at a nightclub in Atlanta last weekend with Ronaldo Esteban. Ronaldo, a recent immigrant from El Salvador, was rumored to have the fastest nut-picking fingers in the tri-county area. I did not confront the pair of them on that occasion, and instead, went over to the bar to meet my friend. Now, she gave me a shy wave from the foyer with her phone in hand, no doubt texting her illicit lover as we spoke. I gave her a smile and a friendly hello before walking into one of the living rooms of the mansion.\n        Uncle Beauregard\u2019s and Aunt Suellen\u2019s daughter, Maybelline, was conspicuously absent as well. She had made up some excuse about getting a head start on studying for her upcoming final exams at Emory University, where she was completing her senior year. But I knew better. She had told me in the strictest confidence that her new boyfriend, Teddy, was allergic to nuts. She decided to spend the holidays with him this year before she broke it off for good; she knew deep down that there could be no real future with Teddy.\n        As I walked through the antique-laden living room towards the kitchen to drop off my dish, I was greeted with a boisterous hug by my uncle, Braxton Hix, the bachelor brother of my mother. Round and jovial, Braxton had always been a favorite uncle of mine until recently. As the assistant to the vice president of Fullerton Nuts, my father, I had noticed some missing tonnage numbers from the warehouse stock books. I had suspected for years that Uncle Braxton was involved in nefarious nut activities. A black market of subpar nuts had made its way onto southern streets in the region, according to some of my inside sources. I knew in my heart that Braxton must be involved somehow. His salary had not been raised in years, and yet last month, I noticed he sported a new designer watch and reupholstered his Porsche. I would have to confront him. But not today. Today, I had bigger biscuits to butter.\n        I walked into the gorgeous, chef-quality kitchen that would make Paula Deen weak in the knees. My cousin, Dawson, gave a shout of recognition as he plated up a carefully constructed turducken on a silver platter. I put down my delicious and simultaneously stunning casserole onto the marble countertop and stared at him in stern silence.\n        \u201cPlease, honey, I know this is a lot for you to keep inside, but can\u2019t you hold off on this confrontation until after the holidays?\" He said with a mouthful of turkey skin.\n        \u201cDawson Fullerton, you have known me since birth, and you know that in the end, \u2018the truth will out.\u2019 But this time, I will out it myself!\u201d I said in a harsh whisper. \n        I marched out of the kitchen and into the dining room. The spread on the solid mahogany table was fit for a king with a southern drawl; collard greens, black-eyed peas, and duck dressing sat in steaming-hot bowls. The room was filled with the remainder of my family, most of them already seated at the twelve-person table and halfway through their Lynchburg Lemonades.\n        I plopped down next to my older sister, Annabess Fullerton, who was in an intense but hushed conversation with my little brother, John Michael Ethan Allan Pottery Barn Fullerton IV. I could not quite make out their whispers, but I knew the conversation had to be about one of two things. Either Annabess was finally admitting to my brother that her roommate, Myrtle, was a bit more than a roommate, or John Michael Ethan Allen Pottery Barn was admitting to our sister that he had dropped out of agrarian studies at Emory and was pursuing his dream of interpretive dance instead. I turned towards the head of the table, not wanting to pry into their conversation but hoping that they would find some solace in each other.\n        Memaw was sitting as straight as an arrow at the head of the table. My mother sat to her right, lovingly patting her hand as she and my father spoke about the boost in spiced nut sales this quarter. Memaw, dressed to the nines as always in her pearls and with a splash of pink lipstick on her puckered lips, immediately could tell that I was upset.\n        \u201cMy sweet girl, you look fit to burst. Whatever is the matter with you?\u201d She said this with a slow and sweet southern drawl that instantly signaled her coming from \u201cold money.\u201d\n        \u201cMemaw, and everyone here, I need your attention.\u201d I banged my fist unceremoniously on the table to quiet the chatter, and spoke with steadiness in my voice now. \u201cI recently found out something quite shocking and cannot keep this information to myself any longer.\u201d\n        Memaw\u2019s lip quivered slightly. I am sure she was wondering if I had seen her yesterday when I stopped at the mansion to drop off some plate warmers. Much like my aunt Suellen, she also found comfort in the fast and furious fingers of Renaldo Esteban. I had seen her, in fact, but could only be happy for her to find pleasure at such a late stage in her life. Such trivial matters were not important in the grand scheme of things.\n        Instead, I pointed at my mother and spoke with courage and conviction to the Fullerton clan.\n        \u201cI suspected for years, but have now come to the realization through a long investigation, that my own dear mother has been using pecans in her pecan pie that she purchased in bulk from a store....in Wilmington, Delaware!\u201d I collapsed into my chair in physical relief that my burden had finally been released to my loved ones to deal with as they saw fit.\n        The family gasped in unison. My dear Memaw clutched at her pearls, and in a whimper I heard her mutter, \u201cYankee nuts!\u201d\n        My mother tried in vain to defend her choices. \u201cWe were there on a business trip to purchase new nut sorting equipment three years ago. While your father was using the restroom, the salesman started talking up the superior oil content of Delaware nuts. Next thing you know, I had my credit card in hand and a subscription delivery service set up to secretly bring me ten-pound bags of pecans to an unmarked PO Box each month. I\u2019m so ashamed.\u201d\n        My cousin Dawson patted my mother\u2019s back as my father lovingly reassured me. \u201cYou did good, dear daughter.\" My dad said.\" After all, honesty is always the best policy.\u201d \n        Suellen wheeled Memaw into the other room for a respite from the drama. My siblings gathered around my sobbing mother as Uncle Braxton Hix spoke to her. \u201cSis, you have a problem. But the first step towards fixing that problem is admitting it exists. You will have to take a sabbatical from your job as the head of the pecan publicity department, of course. The media will have a field day when they find out, so we must manage the bad press, or it will manage us. But we will handle all the specifics of this matter on Monday. Today, my dear, is a day for healing and for family.\u201d\n        While I felt a bit of frustration at my family\u2019s fast forgiveness, I trusted my father and uncle in their shared opinion that all of this could be righted and that we should move forward as a united front. On that note, we wiped our tears and sat back down in our seats. Suellen wheeled a calmer Memaw back to the head of the table, and we all watched as my father, with love in his eyes for us all, carved the turducken.\n"}

In fact, it is not even a natural hair color. It is carrot red! Carrot red! I should be home writing a term paper, but here I am back with the family for an event.

I am about to go full out platinum blonde. I\u2019m so upset and about to lose it.  \n        Let me back up a bit, dear reader, and explain the events that lead to my meltdown.\n        It begins when I arrive home to my grandparents\u2019 house and the entire family is already there.

More importantly, my cousin and I used to have to go to the beauty salon and wait for her to get her hair done. We know! Everyone knows. There is nothing natural here, at least where hair is concerned. Yet, there they sit silently listening to the harpies assault my highlights for being unnatural.

You should listen to them. Be more like them.\u201d Really? REALLY?! How much have you guys had to drink, and not just tonight, but like since forever? Their hair has been this way for some time.

My cousins should really thank me, because I am sure they are getting away with some stuff, whilst my hair is sending my grandmother and aunt into fits of hysteria. Good thing I didn\u2019t tell them about my tattoo. I would for sure get the \u201cyou are on the highway to hell\u201d talk.\n        This particular gathering is all my cousin\u2019s fault. I love her. However, she is expecting, and I am home for her baby shower. I prayed for some last minute dramatic airport shutdown, but alas, here I am. My hair is the hot topic of conversation. Damn, it's great to be home. \n        The baby shower is interesting to say the least. I think someone missed the memo and thought it was a bachelorette party rather than a baby shower. It would have been great to get clued in since I answered the door and the \u201cpolice\u201d to my surprise are there. I told them there is no problem here, and I thought they must have the wrong address.  So, I shut the door, go into the kitchen and tell the group, \u201cOh. My. God! Can you believe the police were just here about a disturbance?\u201d To my surprise, my aunts rush outside after them. Who knew they could run that fast. \n        The dastardly part is, since this is a baby shower, we only have appropriate drinks. Unidentified fruit punch with canned fruit floating in it. Yum. Too bad It doesn\u2019t take the edge off of having to watch your relatives and family friends dance with the \u201cpolice.\u201d\n        But, don\u2019t cry for me, dear reader. I have a bottle of wine stashed in my suitcase, complete with glass and bottle opener. Look, don\u2019t judge. It is a family event, and one needs to be prepared. I\u2019m not going to lie, at this moment, I am in my room trying to \u201cfind\u201d something. I just can\u2019t handle a game of baby bingo. Also, there are images of dancing that need to be erased from my mind before they permanently set in. I also need a break from the barrage of passive-aggressive comments about my unnatural highlights for a few moments. Amazingly enough, everyone, and I mean everyone at the shower, has \u201cnatural\u201d colored hair. Meanwhile, my grandfather and uncles, those lucky \u2026 family members are living it up at the corner bar. \n        Now is the moment. It is time to uncork the bottle. Wow, this Malbec wine is fantastic. Nice, somebody just won baby bingo. Cheers of glee fill the air. If confetti starts swarming the house after this massive win, I wouldn't be surprised. \n        Maybe one more glass before I go back to purgatory. \n        To my relief, I survive the shower, and the remainder of the family visit (with just a little help from my friend, the Malbec). My cousin is delighted with her shower. Excellent. For myself, I only have one more hurdle to endure\u2013 the family breakfast. This breakfast features greasy eggs made by my grandfather, overly buttered toast, some type of potatoes oozing with oil, and sausage. I try to eat as little as possible. That is why the dog sits under the table at my feet. He knows the drill. Luckily, there is coffee. I need coffee. Lots. Of. Coffee. \n        The event of breakfast was even worse than I anticipated, both the food and the conversation. Somehow, in the midst of all the activity of yesterday, my aunt bought me some hair dye. Her ability to accomplish tasks that are none of her business, as always, continues to amaze me. I tell her that my cab is due to pick me up for the airport in less than an hour, so there is no time to accomplish this feat. Maybe next time?\n        My aunt and grandmother continue to grill me on the importance of natural hair. I feel like this falls into the princess bride meme category, \u201cyou keep using that word natural, but it doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means.\u201d My grandfather wants to know if I would like more eggs. I mean, the dog would like more eggs, but he has had enough. \n        I decline and get another cup of coffee, which is just my excuse to double-check that my suitcase is indeed waiting for me at the door. The conversation about dying my hair continues. My cousin fails to offer any help. She just sits there watching and listening. Come on girl, throw me a lifeline, I would do it for you. Solidarity! Fake a contraction! Anything.\n        My aunt opens the box of hair dye. I don\u2019t think that color is even close to my hair color. She begins to read the instructions. It should only take about thirty minutes. She thinks we can do it before the cab arrives. My grandmother agrees. Their insistence about this procedure is so unreal. The music from the Twilight Zone pops into my head. They tell me we should do the deed in the bathroom. No deed. We are doing nothing!\n        Thus it begins, my meltdown of epic proportions. Yelling, I say : \u201cthis is abject insanity! What is wrong with you people?! I\u2019m not rush-dying my hair before the cab gets here. I paid money to have these highlights done, I love them. You are hypocrites! Hypoooooooooooooocrites! Both of you dye your hair. We all know it\u2019s not natural! Honestly, I don\u2019t give a damn because it is not my hair. You do your hair, I do mine! Also, I got a tattoo on my hip. Just so you both have a little extra something to rant about when I leave. A butterfly tattoo! On. My. Hip. It will be there forever. Fooooooooreeeeeeeeeeeever.\u201d They stare at me.\n        It is the calm before the storm. \n        I hear a loud, obnoxious honking. It is the cab! As the Beatles would say, \u201cBeep, Beep, Beep, Beep, yeah!\u201d  Sometimes happiness is a dirty yellow car with slightly deflated wheels. I bid my farewells and make a hasty retreat. The driver takes my bag and I sink gratefully into the dirty, cracked seat. \n        Ah, to dream dear reader. Alas, or thankfully, the epic meltdown only happened in my head. The cab pulled up to the house just as my grandmother and aunt were discussing whether there was enough time to dye my hair. I was saved by the honking. What was in my mind, stayed there. Definitely, a stay of execution. \n        As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t want to live with the eternal recurrence of perpetual fallout for voicing what everyone knows, but will not say: THEY DYE THEIR HAIR! I would never live it down. When they die, they will come back to haunt me if I were to ever say a fraction of what I sometimes think. This is what dreams are for. Some people dream about their next vacation, today, I dream about saying exactly what I wanted to, but never will.\n        Carrot red is not natural. \n"}

His brain whirled with the furious flurry of activity that it had taken to get him in front of the camera. He had halfway stumbled, dazed, into the studio a little over ten minutes before.\n        \u201cGood Lord, Lyle! Are you drunk?\u201d Matt Geller, his longtime producer, barked for an assistant to get some coffee, which was cooled down with milk, so Lyle could down a lot of it fast. A huge Styrofoam cup appeared in his hand around thirty seconds later. The reporter\u2019s stomach protested, but he drank it. All of it.\n        Vanessa, the production assistant, started the countdown to airtime. The adrenaline of the leadup to broadcast time kicked in, and Lyle\u2019s brain unblurred, at least a little. \n        \u201cTen.\u201d \n        He felt the sweat drip down his back, under the unironed shirt and ill-fitting sport jacket that Matt had found in the greenroom and actually thrown at him. Lyle Carlisle, veteran newsman and beloved local TV personality, getting clothes thrown at him. Insulting.\n        \u201cNine.\u201d\n        Genevieve, the hair and makeup assistant, had carefully removed Lyle\u2019s stained yellow polo shirt while trying not to disturb the work of Rick, the makeup guy. Gen opened the collar as widely as she could while she gently slid the sweaty shirt over Lyle\u2019s head. Rick, meanwhile, made his best effort to conceal the bags under Lyle\u2019s eyes\n        \u201cEight.\u201d\n        Rick had chosen a darker shade of foundation than usual, hoping to blend out some of the red, blotchy appearance of Lyle\u2019s skin. Unfortunately, the makeup was too dark for the newscaster\u2019s normal skin tone. It looked kind of orange, and greasy in a way that a quick puff of powder didn\u2019t fix. Now he looked both pasty and orange. \n        \u201cSeven.\u201d\n        Gen had held up the shirt, an off-white button-up belonging to Merle Dervis, the noon weather guy. Merle was at least three inches shorter than Lyle, and proportionally smaller, so the shirt barely buttoned. Lyle\u2019s arms felt like sausages stuffed into the shirt\u2019s sleeves.\n        \u201cSix.\u201d\n        The jacket, also belonging to Merle, looked no better than the shirt. Lyle peered down at his pants, still the dark green sweatpants he\u2019d been wearing when he showed up a full two hours later than his normal arrival. They were covered in Cheezo dust. He gestured to get the camera operator\u2019s attention.\n        \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got the camera fixed on me above the waist, right?\u201d\n        \u201cYou got it, chief!\u201d Lena, who ran the camera on the 6:00 a.m. broadcast, looked far too cheerful. It made Lyle\u2019s head hurt even worse.\n        \u201cFive.\u201d\n        Lyle gulped down the nerves. He had done this job for close to twenty years, but the panic kept rising in his throat like some rookie.\n        Vanessa switched to hand-signaling the final numbers of the countdown so that she wouldn\u2019t be heard on air. Lyle noticed on the studio monitors that his collar stuck up in the back. There was no time to even reach up and fix it.\n        As Vanessa flashed three fingers, Lyle attempted to concentrate on the words of greeting that showed on the screen in front of him. His eyes barely cooperated with his brain.\n        Two fingers, now. Lyle\u2019s stomach lurched, but he fought back the nausea.\n        Vanessa gave the last signal: one finger in the air as the red light on the main camera switched to green. Lyle took a breath, relying on muscle memory to bring him into focus. At that very moment, he also happened to notice on the studio monitors that someone had forgotten to put a tie on him. And he was orange. And he looked like he had on someone else\u2019s clothes because, oh yeah, he did.\n        \u201cWhere\u2019s my tie?\u201d He had said it out loud. \n        Vanessa\u2019s eyes went wide. She mouthed very distinctly, \u201cWe\u2019re on air.\u201d She pointed to the green light on the camera.\n        Lyle\u2019s face went blank for a fraction of a second, and then the adrenaline took over. \u201cGood morning, Kansas! It\u2019s Wednesday, September nineteenth. I\u2019m Lyle Carlisle with the news.\u201d\n        His co-anchor chimed in on cue. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Linda Levine.\u201d\n        None of the normal banter occurred to Lyle, so he went slightly off-protocol, and turned, fake smile gleaming, back to his colleague. \n        \u201cSo, what do we have up for today, Linda?\u201d He turned, his fake smile considerably duller than usual, to gesture towards his co-anchor. The green light on Camera One switched to red, and Camera Two took over. Lyle took a moment to try and catch his breath as Linda spent the next ninety seconds giving briefs on the top stories.\n        Suddenly, Lyle didn\u2019t feel so good. Maybe it was the hot lights. Maybe it was the pressure of having to perform in a state of borderline panic. Maybe it was the coffee the anchorman had chugged. Maybe it was the\u2026\n        How did ninety seconds pass so quickly? Camera One went green, and Lyle realized he needed to read the teleprompter, but the wave of nausea hit him in the gut like a battering ram.\n        \u201cNo. No.\u201d He had said it out loud. \u201cNo!\u201d Again. Also out loud.\n        And then it happened.\n        Lyle Carlisle, host of the most popular morning show in Kansas, vomited. Projectile vomited. On camera. Not just on camera. On the camera.\n        Vanessa gave the signal to \u201cCut!\u201d She then pointed to Camera Two. Linda went pale. The timing of the broadcast was now completely off. That meant Linda was not yet prepared to launch into the second story about the innovative new food offerings at the Kansas State Fair.\n        In the throes of his nausea, Lyle lurched forward and reached out to steady himself by leaning on Camera Two. He leaned on the control panel, moving the camera\u2019s focus away from Linda. Then, he stumbled over a cord and bumped the whole setup, moving the camera off of its marks entirely. Lyle was now on camera. Meanwhile, assistants were trying to clean up the mess as silently as possible.\n        Trying to maintain some semblance of order, Linda soldiered on with her story, detailing the new Fried Butter stand set to premiere at the upcoming state fair. On the monitors, part of the studio floor and a fake set wall were visible, but no Linda. \n        Lyle walked across the set, fully in frame. The Cheezo dust caught the light, making an orange handprint visible on the anchor\u2019s greasy sweatpants.\n        He stopped and looked into the camera, clearly dazed.\n        \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have an ann- ann- announce\u2026 ment.\u201d\n        Vanessa was working with the camera operator to move the arms of the bulky apparatus back to their original position.        \n        Matt, out of the producer\u2019s booth and on the studio floor, had to put his hand over his mouth when he saw the full scope. Lyle bent down a bit so that his face would still be visible on cam. \n        Lyle continued, standing back up to full height. \u201cI really like the Pink Pony Club. Those ladies can really bust a move.\u201d Only his lower half showed on the monitor now. \u201cI went there last night with Dirk Derden from City Council. I hadn\u2019t ever been before, but\u2026\u201d\n        Matt gave the universal \u201ckill it\u201d signal to the booth above the set, using a hand to mimic a knife slitting his throat. The booth cut them to commercial.\n        \u201cLyle! LYLE!\u201d Matt boomed the reporter\u2019s name. However, Lyle Carlisle, veteran anchor, had wandered back towards the greenroom. \n        Lyle Carlisle, was disinvited from his usual duty as MC for opening night at the State Fair. Within a week, though, the Pink Pony Club had offered him a spot in a local TV commercial on Channel Five. Lyle politely declined the offer. His escapade and the results on the news had made him far more famous than he was locally in a matter of about twenty-four hours. He had given the Pink Pony quite enough publicity already, thank you.\n        The Pink Pony also appeared in commercials for Dirk Derden\u2019s opponent in the following weeks leading up to the City Council election. They played on Channel Five as well. Derden lost his bid, but the Pink Pony had its most successful year ever.\n\n\n"}

We\u2019d both attended the same orientation weekend, hit it off almost instantly, and become best friends as the years went on.\n        She stuck by me while I came out as trans, then as non-binary. She held the box of tissues for me as I sobbed about my parents effectively disowning me, about losing my friends from high school, about suddenly feeling adrift in life as my planned career met the wall of just not understanding higher math. \n        And even during those first four years, I noticed things. Like how she always got her first pick of classes and always had excellent professors for those classes. She even got fantastic roommates in the best dorms, given the random nature of the assignment system. (The less said about my second-year roommate, the better.)\n        Even after we graduated, the pattern continued. Gail got a job and a one-bedroom apartment within hours of each other, followed the next day by winning just enough from a scratch-off lottery ticket to cover her expenses for that first month. She found a wallet on a busy street that just happened to belong to a higher up at her job, leading to a transfer and a promotion. And her thrift store luck was absurd; I mean, who even donates a stack of almost new business formal clothing to a hole-in-the-wall family-run thrift shop?\n        I noticed the patterns, but I was a bit too busy getting my feet under me in grad school and adjusting to a houseful of LGBTQIA housemates. The Pride Parade, as we named our little collective, wasn\u2019t perfect by any means. But each of us had been disowned, and each of us knew that found family was just as important, just as valid, as the family you were born into. \u201cThe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,\u201d as the saying goes. And even though Gail didn\u2019t live with us, she hung out, paid for dinners on occasion, and functioned like a satellite member of the household. \n        But the weird coincidences kept stacking up. Things that were so improbable they bordered on impossible, or so Ken, trans man and the Pride Parade\u2019s resident math genius, assured me.\n        Every so often, I\u2019d ask her how all these great things just seemed to fall into her lap. \u201cJust lucky, I guess,\u201d was her usual answer. But it felt too, I don\u2019t know, deliberate in her favor. Especially when it wasn\u2019t just one thing at a time, it was three or four things, all stacked together in a neat row that couldn\u2019t have happened without some kind of interference. And it wasn\u2019t anything realistic, like her family pulling strings or her being a computer genius or even how hard she hustled to make her life work. If I believed in luck as a sentient force, I\u2019d have said it liked her.\n        I suppose it came to a head for me in the third year of my Ph.D. program. I was eyebrow deep in my dissertation, teaching a couple of classes, and too busy for anything resembling a social life. Which was precisely when Gail popped up at the house one evening, gushed about her new job, new apartment, new-to-her car, and how it all came together in a matter of days.\n        Frustrated more with my lack of progress than with her, I grumbled, \u201cHow is it the world just arranges itself to your needs?\u201d \n        Awkwardly, she said, \u201cJust lucky, I guess?\u201d\n        \u201cNo,\u201d I responded, finally looking up from the piece of scholarly work that made me want to tear my hair out. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve known you, things just go your way, especially when you need them to. If this was just luck, you ought to be playing the tables in Vegas.\u201d\n        She paled. We were alone in the Pride Parade house, everyone else off spending their Saturday nights being social or on dates. Even though Gail knew this, she looked around like she expected someone to come out of the woodwork.\n        Slowly, she said, \u201cHarper, it really is just luck.\u201d\n        \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. Saying it\u2019s just luck is like saying Homer strung a few words together in random order that just happened to turn into the Iliad. I\u2019ve noticed it happening since we met eleven years ago.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201d\n        \u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence. You\u2019ve known me for how long?

Lying, though, especially about big stuff? Do I have to reopen my wounds around how my parents lied to me and themselves? Or the past relationships and friendships that went down in flames?\u201d I swore, tears running down my face. \u201cI\u2019ve been in therapy for years because of my trust issues. I don\u2019t want to add you to the list of things I have to talk about for another five years.\u201d\n        She was silent for what felt like hours, but was probably minutes. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to tell you,\u201d she finally admitted quietly.\n        \u201cOkay, that I can work with.\u201d I leaned over to a box of tissues (this phase of my dissertation had me in tears more often than not), grabbed it, and planted it in between us. \u201cBoundaries are healthy, and if you tell me this is a boundary you can\u2019t cross, I won\u2019t push.\u201d\n        She pulled out tissues as the tears started rolling down her face. \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem. I want to tell you. I want to tell you so bad it hurts. I\u2019ve wanted to tell you since I first fell in love with you \u2013\u201d She stopped as her face went deathly white.\n        Stunned, I closed my laptop and pushed it off to the side. Scholarship could wait.\n        \u201cHarper, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to just blurt it out like that.\u201d\n        I reached for her hand. \u201cYou mean, you didn\u2019t just say that to distract me?\u201d\n        She half laughed, half sobbed. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this really well, me admitting I fell in love with you.\u201d She grabbed my hand like a life preserver.\n        \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I fell in love with you after you stayed up with me all night when I worked out I was non-binary. I just didn\u2019t say anything because you were so busy with your own life.\u201d I gently squeezed her hand. \u201cAnd look, this is me not asking anything else about the thing you\u2019ve set a boundary on.\u201d\n        She looked at me, surprise clear on her face. \u201cThat was back in third year of undergrad. You\u2019ve loved me all that time, and you never said anything?\u201d\n        I smiled wryly. \u201cYou were dating Ken - my current housemate - at the time.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd I stopped, like, a month later after he figured out he liked men more,\u201d Gail responded almost instantly. \u201cAll my dates since then have been one-offs, two at most.\u201d She paused. \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t lie there either. I stopped dating Ken because I also realized I\u2019d fallen in love with you after that night, too.\u201d\n        \u201cOh.\u201d I sat there stunned. We\u2019d loved each other for about eight years, and neither of us had said anything. \n        Gail wiped her eyes and face with a tissue, and managed a half laugh. \u201cLook at us. Too busy with our own lives to actually tell each other how we feel.\u201d\n        \u201cI guess\u2026 we didn\u2019t want to risk our friendship?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not upset with you about that, and the other thing, now that you\u2019ve set a boundary, I\u2019ll be good about it.\u201d\n        \u201cNo.\u201d \n        \u201cNo?\u201d I asked with confusion.\n        \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to break the rules for you. Harper, you\u2019re fantastic at boundaries, and you still don\u2019t deserve me hiding part of me from you, not with how you trusted me with your true self eight years ago.\u201d\n        \u201cBut if you\u2019re not supposed to tell me,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cand it\u2019s breaking the rules, I don\u2019t want you getting in trouble.\u201d\n        She shrugged. \u201cThe fact that you know that I\u2019m not supposed to tell you already breaks the rules. And they\u2019re more of what you\u2019d call guidelines anyway.\u201d\n        \u201cDon\u2019t you quote that first Pirates of the Caribbean movie at me. They can\u2019t be just guidelines.\u201d\n        Gail sighed. \u201cOkay, fine, they\u2019re rules, but I\u2019m already going to be in trouble because you know that much.\u201d She grumbled. \u201cI hate that the rules basically say I\u2019m supposed to lie to you, Harper.\u201d\n        Before I could respond, she said in a rush, \u201cI\u2019m a mage. It\u2019s a really generic term, but I do magic. I bend the fabric of reality like a silicone straw. There are others like me, and we\u2019re supposed to stay secret, but all of them are used to lying to people.\u201d\n        I exhaled slowly. \u201cHow much trouble are you in now?\u201d\n        Gail shrugged. \u201cThey can\u2019t take away my magic, it doesn\u2019t work like that. They might demand I cut off contact with you, but they can\u2019t make you forget me or me forget you. They\u2019ll probably shun me for a few years, tell others to shun me too, but I can live with that.\u201d She smiled tremulously at me. \u201cI mean, as long as you\u2019re okay trying out being together?\u201d\n        I sniffled. \u201cI\u2019d like that a lot. I mean, as long as you understand, I don\u2019t really have a life at this point. Doctoral programs act like they\u2019re the only socialization we need.\u201d\n        She blushed a bit. \u201cI can manipulate time, too. As long as you\u2019re with me, I can give us more time.\u201d\n        I snapped the fingers of the hand that wasn\u2019t holding hers. \u201cSo that\u2019s how you always got your homework done on time! I wondered, but I figured you were just good at time management.\u201d\n        Gail giggled a bit. \u201cI\u2019m really good at time management.\u201d Then she happy-sighed, and said, \u201cI love you, Harper, and I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to lie to you anymore about the other thing.\u201d\n        I felt the grin grow on my face. \u201cI love you too, Gail.\u201d"}

Then, they disappeared. \n        \u201cNOW!\u201d Anita was vibrating with rage as she typed.\n        She held the phone, waiting for a response. Nothing. Anita screamed and threw her phone across her kitchen, knocking over a half-full coffee mug. It cracked against the wall, and cold coffee sprayed all over the small kitchen.\n        \u201cOkay. Okay,\u201d she said out loud to herself, and she began taking deep breaths. Her hand was still shaking with rage. She put her hand over her heart and counted to three. \n        Across the room, her phone vibrated. She picked a shard of broken ceramic off the screen and noticed a new crack on the screen. Anoop had written, \u201con my way.\u201d\n        \u201cI can handle this,\u201d she said as she grabbed a broom and started to sweep up the broken pieces of the mug.\n        She continued to take deep breaths as she began to wipe the coffee off the floor. When the kitchen was tidied, she looked at her phone and clicked on the \u201cFind My Friends\u201d app. Anoop always shared his location with her. She could see the little blue dot on her screen moving. He had just left campus, only twenty minutes away by bike.\n        The apartment was eerily quiet now. \n        \u201cAnoop will be back soon. This will all get sorted out,\u201d Anita said to herself. Her hands stopped shaking. She was just about to brew herself a new pot of coffee when she heard a sudden crash. The unmistakable sound of breaking glass came from Anoop\u2019s room. Anita jumped up and nervously walked over to the door.\n        \u201cI\u2019m going to come in now, buddy. Don\u2019t freak out,\u201d she said timidly as she slowly opened the door. There, standing on Anoop\u2019s dresser with shards of broken mirror all around him, was Jasper, a 15-pound macaque monkey. \n        \u201cAlright Jasper. Anoop will be back any minute,\u201d she said, looking at the monkey. He stared back at her with beady eyes and an indifferent expression on his scrunched-up face. She backed out of the doorway and closed the door behind her. \n        Would he be okay in there with the broken glass? She began to worry. But the idea of being in a confined space with a wild animal did not appeal to her. She couldn\u2019t sit still, and she couldn\u2019t open the bedroom door, so she began pacing around her little kitchen.\n        Exactly seventeen minutes later, Anoop came hurtling into the apartment, out of breath.\n        \u201cJasper broke your mirror,\u201d Anita said as her brother approached her.\n        \u201cDid he get hurt?\u201d Jasper asked.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Anita returned.\n        \u201cI\u2019ll get him out of here tomorrow, sis. I promise,\u201d Anoop said casually. He was pulling his old \u201cnothing to see here\u201d move, and Anita wasn\u2019t going to let him get away with it.\n        \u201cYou told me you found a place for him. You swore to me, he\u2019d be out of here by the time I woke up,\u201d she said, her tone flat.\n        \u201cI know. I know,\u201d he said, guilt creeping into his voice.\n        \u201cAnoop, I woke up to a monkey in my bathroom. I had to chase him into your room before he climbed out the window,\u201d she said. Anoop knew she was using her trademark \u201cserenity now\u201d voice. \n        \u201cI\u2019ll find someplace for him to go. Please don\u2019t freak out,\u201d Anoop said, as he cautiously sat down at the table across from his sister.\n        \u201cI am not freaking out. I am calmly and intentionally setting a boundary. You may not harbor a stolen lab monkey in my two-bedroom apartment. Anoop, we\u2019ve had this conversation. Jasper has to go now, and you have to move out.\u201d Now, she was using her no-nonsense, therapy-approved, queen of calm voice. Anoop could see right through it.\n        \u201cCome on, sis. You know you don\u2019t want to do that to us,\u201d Anoop said. Just the hint of his \u201cbut I am so cute; you can\u2019t stay mad at me\u201d smile began to appear on his face. He moved his chair a bit closer to his sister's. If he was taking her demand even a little bit seriously, he certainly wasn\u2019t showing it.\n        \u201cThat monkey was in my bathroom,\u201d Anita repeated. This time, Anoop couldn\u2019t read her tone.\n        \u201cI can\u2019t bring him back to the lab,\" he said flatly.\n        \"You can. You just won't,\" she responded. \n        \"They killed his sister,\u201d Anoop said, leaning his head on her shoulder.\n        \u201cThey killed his sister?\u201d she said, turning to look her brother in the eyes for the first time that day.\n        \u201cHis sister\u2019s name was Jenny. She was a year younger than him. They were both born in the lab. It was terrible, Anita. I saw the whole thing. They gave her too much anesthesia before the experiment. Jasper was right there in the room with her when they did it. He was going to be next. I couldn\u2019t just do nothing,\u201d he said. Anita knew that the sadness in his voice was genuine.\n        \u201cI didn\u2019t know they killed his sister,\u201d she said.\n        \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything worse. Can you?\u201d Anoop had tears in his eyes.\n        \u201cOne more day,\u201d Anita said.\n        \u201cHe\u2019ll be out tomorrow. I\u2019ll find somewhere for him to go. I swear,\u201d he said.\n        \u201cOK,\u201d she said. She knew that he knew that she did not believe him.\n        \u201cI love you, sis,\u201d Anoop said.\n        That much, at least, she knew was true."}

Darcy was getting ready for work when she heard a crashing sound outside her one-bedroom apartment. She looked out the window to see what the commotion was, there was an accident and her car was the victim. Darcy rolled her eyes, took a deep breath and muttered, \u201cwonderful, just wonderful. Now, I\u2019m definitely going to get fired.\u201d  Darcy went downstairs to confront the probably intoxicated driver. Hopefully they were still alive so that she could at least get their insurance information, not that it would matter since  she didn\u2019t have car insurance anyway.\n        She looked in the car and saw a pregnant woman in the driver\u2019s seat. The panicked woman was on the verge of giving birth. Darcy took a closer look and saw that the woman was bleeding profusely from her leg. Darcy panicked when she saw all the blood. It was too much blood. The woman let out a weak scream, and to top it all off the woman gave one final push and the baby came out. \n        Looking down in the nick of time, Darcy caught the child before it could hit the car\u2019s floor. As she did, the woman grabbed Darcy\u2019s arm. On her dying breath, she said \u201cPlease, take care of my baby, do not take my baby to the police. I don\u2019t want my family or the baby\u2019s father to find the baby.\u201d\n        Darcy looked down at the baby; it was a girl, and she was as calm as can be. Darcy wondered if the baby was even alive. To her surprise, she was just sleeping, which was shocking since she entered this world only moments earlier. A decision had to be made, did she take the baby to the police or do as the woman pleaded? With the baby in her arms, she went back to her apartment to call the police to report the accident. \n        Ten Years Later\n        \u201cKarisa, come and get your bag and your lunch. We are going to be late, you know I have a tight schedule,\u201d Darcy yelled. Darcy heard her daughter running and dropping things as she made her way down the stairs. Darcy shook her head and let out a frustrated sigh, \u201cCome on, child, before we both get into trouble. You, being late for school and me, being late for work.\u201d Before walking out the door, Karisa did her usual round of pouts and questions.\n        \u201cMom, I was trying to fix my hair like yours. Why isn\u2019t my hair as curly as yours? It gets curly, but not the poofy afro curl like yours,\u201d Karisa said as she stuck her bottom lip out in her signature pouty face. Her hair was not like Darcy\u2019s, even though Karisa did have an afro it was not as tightly packed as Darcy\u2019s, Karisa\u2019s hair had loose curls.\n        \u201cKarisa, give it time, you are only ten years old; you still have a lot of growing to go through before it happens.\u201d In the back of Darcy\u2019s mind, she knew it would never change as she told her daughter the same lie she had told her everyday for who knows how long. Once in the car, Karisa continued to pick at her hair. Grabbing a bundle and squeezing it together as if that were the way to get those tight curls she so desperately wanted. \n        Darcy made it to work by the skin of her teeth with only seconds to spare. Her coworker Lucy was sitting at their shared desk, she looked up and silently mimed wiping sweat from her brow as Darcy sat down. \u201cLet me guess, Karisa was trying to make her hair look like yours again?\u201d Lucy said, before continuing her leisurely working habits.\n        \u201cOh, you know me so well. Yes, she was, and she just won\u2019t let it go. She will drive me crazy one of these days, and we will both be on the streets if I\u2019m late again because of her antics.\u201d Darcy looked defeated as she finished her statement. Lucy only looked at her sideways, preparing to give one of her speeches, before Darcy held up her hand to stop her. \u201cYes, I know Lucy, I should tell her that I\u2019m not her real mother and this is why she doesn\u2019t have my tight curls. I will, but not now, I\u2019m not ready, and I don\u2019t think she is ready either.\u201d \n        After work, Darcy went straight home, she knew her mother would be there with Karisa, rearing to get back to her own life of playing bingo with the girls.        At home, Darcy\u2019s mother, Kimberly, got up as soon as Darcy walked through the door to make her way out that same door. \u201cMother, aren\u2019t you going to say goodbye to Karisa before you leave?\u201d Kimberly rolled her eyes and then turned around to see if Karisa was around.\n        \u201cWhy should I say anything to that child? She is not yours, you should have taken her to the police that night.\u201d Kimberly tried not to shout it out, but before she knew it, she was yelling. Darcy looked around and tried to quiet her mother down, but it was too late. Karisa came out of her room with tears in her eyes as she looked at them both. \n        \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m not hers?\u201d Karisa asked between hiccuped breaths. Darcy and Kimberly both looked at Karisa before she ran back to her room. Darcy tried to make her way to Karisa\u2019s room to calm her down, but Kimberly stopped her.\n        \u201cQuit lying to that girl; she needs to know the truth. She is not getting any smaller. Eventually she will come asking who she really is, so you might as well get it over with now,\u201d Kimberly said before releasing Darcy\u2019s arm and walking out the door. Kimberly had been against keeping Karisa since the day she came over to find Darcy with the baby. Many arguments were started and remained unresolved over the years. Still, Kimberly, unwillingly came over every day to care for Karisa after she got out of school. Kimberly already knew that Darcy would never give up the child she had sworn to protect. So, she just helped care for the child at arms length in order to not get attached. \n        Darcy took a deep breath and walked to Karisa\u2019s room. Karisa was laying on her bed with her face buried in a pillow as she continued to cry. \u201cKarisa, baby, I need to tell you something. I was trying to wait until you were a little older, but I guess that plan is no longer an option.\u201d Karisa sat up and looked at Darcy, with tears streaming down her face. Darcy pulled Karisa into her arms and proceeded to tell her the story of the night she was born. \n        After Darcy finished, Karisa looked up at her, no longer crying. She wiped her face with her sleeve and proceeded to hug Darcy as if nothing had happened. \u201cThank you for taking me in. I\u2019m not mad that you kept this from me. I\u2019m just glad that you took care of me. I wouldn\u2019t want to end up like one of my classmates who is an orphan and has been in a foster home where they treat her badly.\u201d Just hearing Karisa\u2019s understanding and explanation brought tears to Darcy\u2019s eyes. \n        They sat there hugging each other all night. Darcy thought to herself about how the conversation went and how unexpected the results were. She felt for the child that Karisa told her about, but she knew there was nothing she could do about it without having their own situation investigated. Luckily, she had a friend who was a social worker and knew her circumstances. She would contact him in the morning, to tell him about the child Karisa told her about. \n        As morning came, Darcy woke up to find Karisa was no longer in her arms, but she heard the clinking of dishes downstairs. Darcy went downstairs to investigate and found that Karisa was already dressed and ready to go to school. \u201cGood morning mom. Look at my hair, it is getting closer to yours!\u201d Darcy could do nothing but chuckle and smile at Karisa. \n        Her hair looked the same as the day before, but she was glad that Karisa was chipper, even after the revelation the night before. \n"}

It had been weeks since he had seen growth on the stalks. Too many moons came and went since a proper harvest had been reaped. \n        On the morrow, Piter would be forced to travel into town and beg for corn and wheat, so that he and his wife, Mary Jo, could have something other than fresh eggs and goat milk. He had done this only once, and the townsfolk had been kind enough to spare some grains and fruit, but it was the principle of the matter that did not sit well with Piter. He was a prideful man who felt great shame in asking others for something he ought to already have. Still, the drought and the return of the pestilent locust had left him no choice.\n        Piter ran his fingers through the soft fur of his tabby cat, Thomasin. She purred as the sun crept over the horizon. \n        Mary Jo joined Piter by the fence he had built ten years ago when they picked this cursed plot of land to build their lives. She brought him a cup of herbal tea she had concocted.  The fragrant spices woke up Piter\u2019s tastebuds. He drank and found his worries calmed. She rubbed his hunched shoulders and whispered in his ear, \u201cWe will find a way. We always do.\u201d \n        Piter found comfort in his wife\u2019s confidence, although he did not share her optimism. Winter was only two months away and if they did not harvest crops before the weather turned, they might not make it through to see the spring. As he sipped the tea, his mind drifted from present and future anxieties back into memories he and Mary Jo had made since settling in this strange new land.\n        He began to grow sleepy as he remembered the times they spent building their cabin, herding their goats, the birth of their child, Neville. Neville had been a blessing to their lives. Oh, how Piter missed his baby boy. The thought of his disappearance made Piter's knees weak. \n        Mary Jo caught him under the arm and helped him into the cabin by the fireplace. She tucked blankets around him and brewed another cup of the herbal tea. After some time, Piter drifted off to sleep, an unusual occurrence this early in the morning. \n        When he awoke, it was nearly midday. As he stepped outside, he heard the unmistakable rumble of distant thunder. Sure enough, on the horizon, dark storm clouds were rolling in. \n        \u201cWhat a stroke of luck\u2026\u201d Piter marveled to himself. \u201cMary Jo,\u201d he called out, \u201cMary Jo, it\u2019s a miracle!\u201d But Mary Jo was not to be found. Piter checked in the stable, behind the woodpile, even back inside, but she was not there. He did his best not to worry, but as time passed and the dark rain clouds grew closer, he could not help himself from growing concerned.\n        To distract his mind, Piter rounded up the animals. First, the goats, then the chickens, and finally the tabby cat. He called out for the cat, \u201cThomasin! Here kitty cat\u2026\u201d But after a few minutes without finding the cat, Piter abandoned that as well.\n        In one final attempt to put his mind to ease, he packed his pipe with tobacco and struck a match. Before he could puff it, he stopped at the sound of branches snapping. He whipped his head around. Mary Jo emerged from the tree line, clothes dirty and barefoot. There were noticeable specks of blood on her smock. \n        Piter ran to her. \u201cWhat is it? Is there something after you? What has happened to you?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m fine, Piter. We\u2019re going to be fine. I'll clean up and rest now.\u201d She brushed Piter\u2019s hands off and staggered toward the cabin. \n        Piter was speechless. He watched her go inside, and then he turned back to the densely wooded forest. Piter had hunted squirrels and rabbits there in the early days of moving here, but it was treacherous to maneuver through the thick brush, so he had abandoned that long ago. \n        That night, Piter fried eggs for dinner as it poured rain outside. He offered some to Mary Jo, but she claimed she was not hungry and that she would be happier and hungrier once the crops grew from this downpour of rain. This could not be true; she had not eaten in almost two days. He asked urgently, \u201cWhat were you doing in the forest today?\u201d \n        She dodged the question, pulling out her book of fairy tales that she used to read to Neville when he was just a baby. Piter had always felt the stories were too dark for such a young boy. Now, Mary Jo read them from time to time when she was thinking of Neville.\n        Piter wanted to know what she was keeping from him. \u201cTell me what it was that you did in the forest today. I know it was no coincidence that I dozed off at such an early hour. Did you poison me then?\u201d\n        She responded without looking up from the book, \u201cI would never do such a thing to someone I love.\u201d\n        \u201cDo you lie to my face?\u201d\n        \u201cI do not.\u201d\n        Piter fumed. He snatched the book from her hands. \u201cWhy is it that you keep secrets from me? What is it that you are hiding?\u201d She stared back at him with icy eyes. Lightning illuminated the room. He continued pressing her, \u201cTell me what it is you are hiding! I command you!\u201d \n        \u201cI will tell you nothing, for I hide nothing.\u201d\n        \u201cDid you take Thomasin the cat into the forest with you today?\u201d He waited for a response, but all Mary Jo did was curl her lips into a thin smile. He pressed, \u201cDid you take my cat from me?\u201d\n        \u201cAye. I did. And because of it we have been saved.\u201d She gestured emphatically at the window where rain water seeped through the wood. \u201cLook, Piter! We are saved.\u201d\n        Piter gulped. He did not want to believe the words he had just heard. \u201cWhy? What kind of witch are you, that you would say such a thing? Is this all a joke?\u201d\n        She sounded genuinely sorry as she responded, \u201cI had to. For us.\u201d \n        Piter stumbled backward, catching himself in a chair. The truth was still sinking in. The gears were still turning in his mind as he wrestled to understand.  \n        Mary Jo knelt by his side and said in a sweet voice, \u201cWe are saved, my love. The rains have come and we are saved. Be still and rest.\u201d\n        Piter\u2019s eyes welled up as he asked the question he had dreaded, \u201cWhat of Neville? What of my son? And the improvement in the soil? And the change in the winds that drove the locust South? What of all the good fortune we had through the years? And all the misfortune that came along with it? My missing cat! My missing son! What of it all then, witch?\u201d\n        He stood up and made for the door. Mary Jo raised an outstretched arm and called out in a commanding voice that Piter had not heard prior, \u201cStop. You will not leave. Sit. Stay. You must!\u201d Her voice softened, \u201cCome here. I insist, my love.\u201d\n        Piter thought she was mad to think that he would listen to her. His mind was made up. She needed to be brought to justice and the townsfolk would see to that. \n        Yet, despite now knowing his wife to be a witch, Piter found himself involuntarily turning around and sitting back down. Mary Jo rubbed her fingers through his hair, which soothed him, even though internally Piter was still angered beyond compare.\n        He whispered to her, \u201cYou devil.\u201d \n        She kissed him and whispered back, \u201cSleep now.\u201d\n        His eyes closed, and he fell into a deep slumber for many hours. \n        When he awoke, he was disoriented and his mind was foggy. He noticed a cup of steaming tea beside him, so he sipped it and made his way outside. The rain had stopped, but the ground was soaked.\n        Mary Jo was collecting eggs in her apron. She noticed him looking around wearily. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\n        He smiled. \u201cMuch better. I had the craziest dreams in my sleep. At least the rain proved to be real after all.\u201d\n        She replied, \u201cAye. Bless the rain. We are saved because of it. I told you we would find a way.\u201d\n        Piter felt she might be right indeed. \u201cWe always do.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight. Something flickered in the woods and caught his eye as they headed inside. He thought of it no more as his mind wandered to the whereabouts of his rascal tabby cat, Thomasin."}

I just got off the phone with her. She\u2019s on her way,\u201d Pepper blurted out.\n        \u201cI\u2019m not letting her in. I told her I needed time,\u201d Jade responded.\n        \u201cShe\u2019s said she's tired of waiting for you to forgive her,\u201d Pepper huffed. \n        \u201cYou have every right to be mad and not talk to her. But I really think you are putting this off just because you don\u2019t like confrontation. No matter what you choose, I am on your side.\u201d Pepper pulled Jade into an embrace. Tears plopped on Pepper\u2019s back. \n        Ding. Dong. The two turned to the door. Jade exhaled and made her way to the door. \n        Sally stood at the door, her eyes wide. \u201cAre you letting me in?\u201d Sally asked. \n        Jade turned to Pepper for support. Jade looked back at Sally and moved to the side. Sally entered. Jade closed the door, and the three moved into the living room. \n        Jade and Pepper sat on the couch. Sally shuffled her feet as she stood in front of the two women. \n        \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d Pepper exclaimed. \n        \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for years. I don\u2019t understand why you two have pushed me away. I miss you,\u201d Sally lamented. \n        Jade wrung her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not for no reason. You just didn\u2019t think I knew.\u201d\n        Sally\u2019s once wanting demeanor changed. No longer able to maintain her naivet\u00e9, she sat on the closest chair.  \u201cSo, what now? I\u2019m sorry. Okay?\u201d Sally said nonchalantly.\n        Rage flowed through Jade. Sally always tried to diminish her actions. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry?!\u201d \n        \u201cYes, I am. I know you probably don\u2019t understand. But this really has been hard for me. You two are my best friends, and I couldn\u2019t come to you at all.\u201d Sally said in a small voice.\n        Pepper leaned forward. \u201cAre you blaming us? How did you think we would react?\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m just saying, I needed you guys. This has been hard.\u201d Sally offered.\n        Jade jerked up. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not saying anything. You\u2019ve been lying for years, and yeah, that\u2019s my fault; I\u2019ve let so much slide. But this is unforgivable. You used our relationship as leverage to get you promoted and undermine my job. But now you want to complain because you can\u2019t do the job. You need someone to hold your hand? Tough! I lost my job. I\u2019m the victim. Not you.\u201d\n        \u201cWow,\u201d Sally said, shocked.\n        \u201cYeah, wow. I think I\u2019m done. Yeah, I\u2019m actually done. I\u2019m not sure what your intention was, but thanks for stopping by. You can leave now.\u201d Jade motioned for Sally to leave.\n        \u201cSome friends y'all are.\u201d Sally said as she left.\n        Pepper tilted her head and waved to Sally. \u201cSee ya.\u201d Pepper squeezed Jade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d \n        Jade turned to Pepper. \u201cFree.\u201d "}
